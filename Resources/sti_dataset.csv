"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are a significant public health concern as they cause various cancers, including those of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis, and oropharynx, in both women and men.
Individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, have an increased risk of developing persistent HPV infection and subsequent precancerous lesions due to their immunosuppression.
Vaccination and screening for precancerous lesions are 2 central management strategies that must be implemented in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Although HPV vaccination has been proven to be safe and effective in these patients, coverage remains low and should be encouraged. Screening for cervical cancer should be more widely implemented in this population, as recommended in guidelines for other immunosuppressed patients.
Catch-up vaccination, vaginal self-sampling screening for HPV detection, and therapeutic vaccination are new options that should be considered.",,"[{'lastname': 'Goulenok', 'firstname': 'Tiphaine', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of Internal Medicine, Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sacré', 'firstname': 'Karim', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",HPV Infection and Prevention in Patients With Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: A Scoping Review.
"Contraception can help individuals with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) to avoid undesired pregnancies and improve reproductive outcomes. Despite the importance of contraception in the care of females with RMDs, evidence suggests that many of these individuals do not receive consistent or disease-specific counseling regarding contraceptive options. This includes female patients receiving teratogenic prescriptions as part of the management of their RMDs, or who have severe disease activity that might culminate in adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Contraceptive counseling can help females with RMDs who wish to prevent pregnancy to select a contraceptive method that is best for them.We conducted a narrative review of the primary literature addressing reversible, prescription-based contraception for females with RMDs, framed by published guidelines on contraceptive safety. Many safe and effective contraceptive options are available for females with RMDs. Special considerations must be given to individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus, whose disease activity may be exacerbated by exogenous estrogen. Females with positive antiphospholipid antibodies should avoid estrogen-containing contraception due to an unacceptable risk of thrombosis and should conditionally avoid depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, which appears to have a prothrombotic signature. Limited contraceptive options are available to male patients. Contraceptive care for adolescents with RMDs can be extrapolated from guidelines written for adult patients, with the additional consideration of barrier protection for individuals at risk for sexually transmitted infections. Future research is needed to assess the effects of contraception use on rheumatic disease activity and side effects.",,"[{'lastname': 'Luche', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'From the Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.'}, {'lastname': 'Talabi', 'firstname': 'Mehret Birru', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.'}]",Contraceptive Care in the Rheumatic Diseases: A Review.

"Malaria and HIV infection overlap geographically in sub-Saharan Africa and share risk factors. HIV infection increases malaria's severity, especially in pregnant women. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for pregnant women living in areas of stable malaria transmission. However, HIV-positive women on daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (recommended for prevention of opportunistic infections in people with HIV) cannot receive SP due to adverse drug interactions, so malaria prevention in this vulnerable population currently relies on daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone. This review is based on a new protocol and provides an update to the 2011 Cochrane Review that evaluated alternative drugs for IPTp to prevent malaria in HIV-positive women.
To compare the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment regimens for malaria prevention in HIV-positive pregnant women.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trial registries to 31 January 2024. To identify relevant additional studies or unpublished work, we checked references and contacted study authors and other researchers working on malaria and HIV.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intermittent preventive treatment regimen for preventing malaria in HIV-positive pregnant women against daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone, placebo, current or previous standard of care, or combinations of these options. By 'standard of care' we refer to the country's recommended drug regimen to prevent malaria in pregnancy among HIV-positive women, or the treatment that a trial's research team considered to be the standard of care.
Review authors, in pairs, independently screened all records identified by the search strategy, applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias in included trials, and extracted data. We contacted trial authors when additional information was required. We presented dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs), count outcomes as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs). We presented all measures of effect with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for what we considered to be the main comparisons and outcomes.
We included 14 RCTs, with a total of 4976 HIV-positive pregnant women initially randomized. All trials assessed the efficacy and safety of one antimalarial used as IPTp (mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine, SP, or azithromycin) with or without daily cotrimoxazole, compared to daily cotrimoxazole alone, placebo, or a standard of care regimen. We grouped the trials into nine comparisons. Our main comparison evaluated the current standard of care (daily cotrimoxazole) with another drug regimen (mefloquine or dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine) versus daily cotrimoxazole with or without placebo. In this comparison, two trials evaluated mefloquine and three evaluated dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. We conducted meta-analyses that included trials evaluating dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine plus cotrimoxazole, and trials that evaluated mefloquine plus cotrimoxazole, as we considered there to be no qualitative or quantitative heterogeneity among trials for most outcomes. We considered drug-related adverse events and HIV-related outcomes to be drug-specific. Daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis plus another drug regimen (mefloquine or dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine) probably results in lower risk of maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.95; 2406 participants, 5 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). It results in little or no difference in maternal anaemia cases at delivery (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 2417 participants, 3 trials; high-certainty evidence). It probably results in a decrease in placental malaria measured by blood smear (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; 1337 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably results in little or no difference in low birth weight (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.41; 2915 participants, 5 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). There is insufficient evidence to ascertain whether daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis plus another drug regimen affects the risk of cord blood parasitaemia (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.64; 2696 participants, 5 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis plus another drug regimen probably results in little or no difference in foetal loss (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.46; 2957 participants, 5 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in little or no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.14; 2706 participants, 4 trials; low-certainty evidence). Due to the probability of an increased risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission and some adverse drug effects noted with mefloquine, we also looked at the results for dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine specifically. Dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine plus daily contrimoxazole probably results in little to no difference in maternal peripheral parasitaemia (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.11; 1517 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) or anaemia at delivery (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1454 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but leads to fewer women having placental malaria when measured by histopathologic analysis (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 1570 participants, 3 trials; high-certainty evidence). The addition of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine to daily cotrimoxazole probably made little to no difference to rates of low birth weight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48; 1695 participants, 3 trials), foetal loss (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.90; 1610 participants, 3 trials), or neonatal mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.72; 1467 participants, 2 trials) (all moderate-certainty evidence). We found low-certainty evidence of no increased risk of gastrointestinal drug-related adverse events (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.98; 1447 participants, 2 trials) or mother-to-child HIV transmission (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.26 to 9.19; 1063 participants, 2 trials).
Dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and mefloquine added to daily cotrimoxazole seem to be efficacious in preventing malaria infection in HIV-positive pregnant women compared to daily cotrimoxazole alone. However, increased risk of HIV transmission to the foetus and poor drug tolerability may be barriers to implementation of mefloquine in practice. In contrast, the evidence suggests that dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine does not increase the risk of HIV mother-to-child transmission and is well tolerated.",,"[{'lastname': 'Pons-Duran', 'firstname': 'Clara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Maternal, Child and Reproductive Health Initiative, Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Hospital Clínic - Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

"Studies using estimated blood loss show the association of either human papillomavirus (HPV) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). We study the association of HPV or CIN with either blood loss or PPH as measured by the more precise measure of quantitative blood loss (QBL). We retrospectively studied 2,334 peripartum women with a documented Pap smear prior to de- livery. The main predictor variable had categories for HPV and CIN as compared to normal cytology. Covariates included demographics, medical/surgical history, and pregnancy variables. Model 1 included the whole sample. Model 2 included only those with an operative vaginal delivery or a cesarean delivery. Outcome measures were QBL and PPH measured by QBL. We found in model 1 that those HPV positive and those with CIN were each not significantly associated with QBL. In model 2, those HPV positive were significantly associated with increased QBL (B = 0.11, SE = 0.05, p = 0.047), while CIN was not significantly associated with QBL. In model 1, those HPV positive and those with CIN were each not significantly associated with PPH. In model 2, those HPV positive were significantly associated with increased odds for PPH (OR:11.03, 9% CI:1.77, 68.74, p = 0.01) while CIN was not significantly associated with PPH. In conclusion, the presence of HPV was positively associated with an increase in the QBL and PPH at time of delivery for those with operative vaginal and cesarean deliveries. We suggest that clinicians take HPV results of Pap smears into consideration when considering a patient's risk of PPH.",,"[{'lastname': 'Mozey', 'firstname': 'Makayla', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fogel', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, New York; Department of Management, Marketing, and Entrepreneurship, Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Itzhak', 'firstname': 'Petr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, New York, USA. pitzhak@numc.edu.'}]","Human Papillomavirus, Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and Quantitative Blood Loss at Delivery."
"Prenatal administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a strategy that could be exploited to prevent viral infections during pregnancy and early life. To reach protective levels in fetuses, mAbs must be transported across the placenta, a selective barrier that actively and specifically promotes the transfer of antibodies (Abs) into the fetus through the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Because FcRn also regulates Ab half-life, Fc mutations like the M428L/N434S, commonly known as LS mutations, and others have been developed to enhance binding affinity to FcRn and improve drug pharmacokinetics. We hypothesized that these FcRn-enhancing mutations could similarly affect the delivery of therapeutic Abs to the fetus. To test this hypothesis, we measured the transplacental transfer of leronlimab, an anti-CCR5 mAb, in clinical development for preventing HIV infections, using pregnant rhesus macaques to model ",,"[{'lastname': 'Zikos', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource (NHPRR), Department of Medicine - Innate Immunity, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Webb', 'firstname': 'Gabriela M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pathobiology & Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Helen L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pathobiology & Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reed', 'firstname': 'Jason S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pathobiology & Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), University of California, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Usachenko', 'firstname': 'Jodie L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), University of California, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaqra', 'firstname': 'Ala M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biotechnology, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schiffer', 'firstname': 'Celia A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biotechnology, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Rompay', 'firstname': 'Koen K A', 'initials': 'KKA', 'affiliation': 'California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), University of California, Davis, CA, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sacha', 'firstname': 'Jonah B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pathobiology & Immunology, Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnani', 'firstname': 'Diogo M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource (NHPRR), Department of Medicine - Innate Immunity, UMass Chan Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.'}]",FcRn-enhancing mutations lead to increased and prolonged levels of the HIV CCR5-blocking monoclonal antibody leronlimab in the fetuses and newborns of pregnant rhesus macaques.

"The uptake of daily oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-a highly effective intervention-remains low among African adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who could benefit. AGYW who initiate PrEP often do so through informal peer referral, which may be enhanced with formalized peer referral and peer-delivered HIV self-testing (HIVST). To understand the feasibility of this PrEP referral model among AGYW, we conducted a pilot study in Kenya.
From March to May 2022, we recruited AGYW (≥16-24 years) using PrEP (i.e., ""peer providers"") from public healthcare clinics in Kiambu County and trained them on HIV prevention, HIVST use, and peer-supported linkage to clinic-based HIV services. Following training, peer providers received eight HIVST kits and were encouraged to refer four peers (i.e., ""peer clients"") to PrEP. We completed surveys with peer providers and clients one month following intervention delivery to assess PrEP initiation among peer clients. Later, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with peer providers and clients to identify factors that facilitated or challenged intervention outcomes.
We trained 16 peer providers (median age: 23 years, IQR 21-24) who reported delivering the intervention to 56 peer clients; 30 peer clients (median age: 21 years, IQR 19-22) contacted the study team and were enrolled. Most of the enrolled peer clients reported behaviors associated with HIV risk (e.g., condomless sex; 80%, 24/30) and were PrEP-naïve (87%, 26/30). At one-month, PrEP initiation among eligible PrEP-naïve peer clients was high, as reported by providers (78%, 43/55) and clients (85%, 22/26); recent HIVST use was also high among peer clients (provider report: 95%, 53/56; client report: 97%, 29/30). In the FGDs, participants reported that intervention outcomes were facilitated by close preexisting relationships, HIVST assistance, and being escorted to clinic-based HIV services by peer providers; intervention barriers included conflicting priorities and limited HIVST experience.

"People living with HIV are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and myocardial infarction related to atherosclerosis than the uninfected population. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in a young, mid-eastern European population of PLWH receiving ART for undetectable viremia.
This was a single-centre study. We included 34 patients below 50 years old, treated in Szczecin, Poland, with confirmed HIV-1 infection, treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), and undetectable viremia. All patients underwent coronary artery computed tomography (CACT), carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) evaluation, and echocardiography.
In the primary assessment, only two (5.8%) patients had an increased CVD risk calculated using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), but we identified coronary or carotid plaques in 26.5% of the patients. Neither traditional risk factors nor those associated with HIV significantly influenced the presence of the plaque. IMT was significantly positively correlated with age and the FRS (R=0.38, p=0.04). Relative wall thickness assessed in echocardiography was higher in those with plaque (0.49 vs 0.44, p=0.04) and significantly correlated with IMT (R=0.38, p=0.04).
In our population, more than a quarter of PLWH with undetectable viremia had subclinical atherosclerosis in either the coronary or carotid arteries. The FRS underpredicted atherosclerosis in this population. The role of RWT as a possible early marker of atherosclerosis needs further studies.","In the primary assessment, only two (5.8%) patients had an increased CVD risk calculated using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), but we identified coronary or carotid plaques in 26.5% of the patients.

"Patients with suspected mpox presented to different venues for evaluation during the 2022 outbreak. We hypothesized that practice patterns may differ across venue of care.
We conducted an observational study of patients undergoing mpox testing between 1 June 2022 and 15 December 2022. We assessed concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, sexual history, and anogenital examination and a composite outcome of all 3, stratified by site. Venue of care was defined as ED (emergency department or urgent care), ID (infectious disease clinic), or PCP (primary care or other outpatient clinic).
Of 276 patients included, more than half (62.7%) were evaluated in the ED. Sexual history, anogenital examination, and STI testing were documented as performed at a higher rate in ID clinic compared to ED or PCP settings. STIs were diagnosed in 20.4% of patients diagnosed with mpox; syphilis was the most common STI among patients diagnosed with mpox (17.5%). Patients evaluated in an ID clinic had higher odds ratio of completing all 3 measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.6 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-9.3]) compared to PCP setting adjusted for age, gender, and men who have sex with men status. Cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender males, and transgender females had higher odds ratio of completing all 3 measures compared to cisgender females (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0 [95% confidence interval, 1.9-8.4]) adjusted for age and venue of care.

"The presence of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) is posing an increasing threat to HIV control. Here we investigated drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and PDR among 6831 HIV-infected individuals from 2018 to 2022 in Guangzhou, China. DRMs were detected among 24.5% of the patients. The overall prevalence of PDR was 7.4%, with resistance rate to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) being 1.3%, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 4.8%, and protease inhibitor (PI) 1.4%. Abacavir (0.8%) resistance was the most common in NRTI, followed by resistance to emtricitabine (0.6%), lamivudine (0.6%), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (0.3%). In NNRTI, nevirapine (3.7%) resistance was the most common, followed by efavirenz (3.5%) and rilpivirine (3.4%). Among PI, resistance to tipranavir (0.8%), nelfinavir (0.6%), fosamprenavir (0.2%) and lopinavir (0.1%) was most frequent. Annual prevalence of PDR showed an increase trend from 2018 to 2022, although not significant. In the multivariable logistic regression model, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, circulating recombinant form (CRF) 55_01B, CRF08_BC, CRF59_01B, and subtype B were demonstrated as associated risk factors for PDR. The overall prevalence of PDR in Guangzhou was moderate, with relatively severe NNRTI resistance.

"The MtrCDE efflux pump of Neisseria gonorrhoeae exports a wide range of antimicrobial compounds that the gonococcus encounters at mucosal surfaces during colonization and infection and is a known gonococcal virulence factor. Here, we evaluate the role of this efflux pump system in strain FA1090 during in vivo human male urethral infection with N. gonorrhoeae using a controlled human infection model. With the strategy of competitive infections initiated with mixtures of wild-type FA1090 and an isogenic mutant FA1090 strain that does not contain a functional MtrCDE pump, we found that the presence of the efflux pump is not required for an infection to be established in the human male urethra. This finding contrasts with previous studies of in vivo infection in the lower genital tract of female mice, which demonstrated that mutant gonococci of a different strain (FA19) lacking a functional MtrCDE pump had a significantly reduced fitness compared to their wild-type parental FA19 strain. To determine if these conflicting results are due to strain or human vs. mouse differences, we conducted a series of systematic competitive infections in female mice with the same FA1090 strains as in humans, and with FA19 strains, including mutants that do not assemble a functional MtrCDE efflux pump. Our results indicate the fitness advantage provided by the MtrCDE efflux pump during infection of mice is strain dependent. Owing to the equal fitness of the two FA1090 strains in men, our experiments also demonstrated the presence of a colonization bottleneck of N. gonorrhoeae in the human male urethra, which may open a new area of inquiry into N. gonorrhoeae infection dynamics and control.

We assessed maternal mortality and adverse birth outcomes for all singleton pregnancies from mid-November 2021 (the start of the Omicron era) to mid-August 2022 at nine Tsepamo sites, among individuals with documented SARS-CoV-2 screening PCR or antigen tests and known HIV status. Of 9,705 women routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection at delivery (64% of deliveries at these sites), 373 (3.8%) tested positive. Women with HIV were as likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (77/1833, 4.2%) as women without HIV (293/6981, 4.2%) (p = 1.0). There were 5 recorded maternal deaths (0.03%), one occurring in a woman with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. In contrast, maternal mortality was 3.7% and 0.1% in those with and without SARS-CoV-2, respectively, during the pre-Omicron era. In the Omicron era, there were no differences among infants exposed or unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 in overall adverse birth outcomes (28.1% vs 29.6%; aRR 1.0, 95%CI 0.8-1.1), severe adverse birth outcomes (11.9 vs 10.6%; aRR 1.1, 95%CI 0.8-1.5), preterm delivery (15.1% vs 14.9%; aRR 1.0, 95%CI 0.8-1.3), or stillbirth (1.9% vs 2.3%; aRR 0.8, 95%CI 0.4-1.7). Adverse outcomes among those exposed to both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those exposed to HIV alone (31.2% vs. 33.1%; aRR 0.9, 95%CI 0.6-1.3; p = 0.5). Maternal mortality was far lower in Botswana during the Omicron era than in the pre-Omicron era, and adverse birth outcomes were no longer significantly impacted by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 either overall or with HIV co-exposure. Increased population immunity to SARS-CoV-2, less stress on the hospital systems in the Omicron era, and possible differences in viral pathogenicity may combine to explain these findings.",,"[{'lastname': 'Banga', 'firstname': 'Jaspreet', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Jackson-Gibson', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.""}, {'lastname': 'Diseko', 'firstname': 'Modiegi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.'}, {'lastname': 'Caniglia', 'firstname': 'Ellen C', 'initials': 'EC', 'affiliation': 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayondi', 'firstname': 'Gloria', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.'}, {'lastname': 'Mabuta', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.'}, {'lastname': 'Luckett', 'firstname': 'Rebecca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Moyo', 'firstname': 'Sikhulile', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Botswana Harvard Health Partnership, Gaborone, Botswana.\nDepartment of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

"Apart from HIV acquisition, men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis. Although the intersection between syphilis and HIV poses a formidable challenge among key populations who are known to be vulnerable to many health threats, there is little known about syphilis infection among MSM living with HIV in Ghana. This study seeks to investigate the burden of syphilis and address the existing knowledge gap by exploring behavioral, healthcare access, and structural factors influencing the syphilis burden within the HIV-positive MSM population.
This study was conducted in 2023 as part of the bio-behavioral survey (BBS) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey that used a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) approach was conducted in the old ten regions of Ghana. Data was collected on 3,420 participants, however, 857 HIV-positive MSM were included in this study since it focused on syphilis among HIV-positive MSM in Ghana. The study estimated the prevalence of syphilis among MSM living with HIV and provided a 95% confidence interval across different categories of explanatory variables. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with overall syphilis prevalence. All other analyses were weighted due to the complex design of the study.
The overall prevalence of syphilis was 23.83% (95% CI: 20.44, 27.58). HIV-positive men who only had sex with men had a 29.77% (95% CI: 23.90, 36.40) prevalence of syphilis compared to a prevalence of 9.50% (95% CI: 2.56, 29.53) recorded by HIV-positive MSM who were attracted to mostly females. Participants who ever had receptive anal sex recorded a higher prevalence 26.79% (95% CI: 22.78, 31.23) than those who never had receptive anal sex 12.86% (95% CI: 8.02, 19.99). The odds of syphilis among HIV-positive MSM who never used condoms with regular sex partners in the last 6 months were 41.08 (aOR: 41.08 at 95% CI 1.24-136.42; p = 0.038).

"Introduction International research suggests free online postal self-sampling for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing is an acceptable alternative to clinic-based testing. A user-pays online STI testing service exists in Aotearoa New Zealand, but acceptability among priority populations is unknown. Aim To explore Māori and Pacific young people's perspectives on online postal self-sampling for STI testing (as prospective service users). Methods Four wānanga (knowledge-sharing forum) were held between November 2022 and May 2023 with Māori and Pacific participants aged 15-24 years who were recruited via youth-focused community organisations. Three facilitators guided discussions about STI testing and use of an online service. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse data generated from audio-recorded discussions, group work notes and facilitator field notes. Results None of the 38 participants were aware of online STI testing and all considered it cost-prohibitive. Perceptions of online testing were mixed, and discussion about concerns outweighed perceived benefits. Three themes were identified: (i) potential to support autonomy (perceived benefits and positive features of self-sample collection kits); (ii) barriers and process-related concerns; and (iii) tailoring online STI testing to young people's needs (facilitating engagement with online testing). Discussion For online STI testing to be an accessible alternative to clinic-based testing for priority populations, cost, low awareness and other barriers in the testing pathway need to be addressed. Clinician follow-up on positive results and free treatment would be critical to ensure the cycle of best practice care is completed. Regardless of where testing is accessed, investment is needed to support young people's knowledge of when, why and how to access a sexual health check.",,"[{'lastname': 'Rose', 'firstname': 'Sally B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Gardiner', 'firstname': 'Tracey', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Dunlop', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Cole', 'firstname': 'Marama', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Garrett', 'firstname': 'Susan M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'McKinlay', 'firstname': 'Eileen M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice, University of Otago, PO Box 7343, Wellington South, Wellington, New Zealand.'}]",Māori and Pacific young people's perspectives on testing for sexually transmitted infections via an online service: a qualitative study.

In this work, we identified three HIV-1 nucleotide sequences previously classified as unique recombinant forms (URFs), plus one new partial genome sharing the same BC recombination pattern. The mosaic genome is almost entirely represented by the subtype C sequence, with a small subtype B recombination region in the pol gene, at the Integrase level.

"Emergency department (ED) patients requiring immediate treatment often bypass a triage process that includes HIV screening. In this study we aimed to investigate the potential missed opportunity to screen these patients for HIV.
We conducted this cross-sectional study in a municipal ED over a six-week period between June-August 2019. The patient population in this study arrived in the ED as a pre-notification from prehospital services or designated by the ambulance or walk-in triage nurse as requiring immediate medical attention. Medical student researchers collected demographic data and categorized patients into three clinical groups (trauma, medical, psychiatric). They documented the patient's eligibility for HIV screening as determined by a physician and confirmed that the patient met criteria of clear mental status, controlled pain, stable vital signs, and ability to contribute to a medical history and physical examination. The student researchers did this at initial presentation and then again during the patient's ED stay of up to eight hours. The study outcomes measured the percentage of total patients within each clinical group (trauma, medical, psychiatric) able to engage in the HIV screening process upon arrival and during an eight-hour ED stay.
On average, 700 patients per month are announced on arrival via overhead page, indicating that they require immediate medical attention. During the six-week study, 205 patients (approximately 20% of total) were enrolled: 114 trauma; 56 medical; and 35 psychiatric presentations. The average patient age was 53; 60% of patients were male. Niney-eight (48%) patients were eligible for HIV screening within an eight-hour ED stay; 63 (31%) were able to be screened upon initial presentation and 35 (17%) in the first eight hours of their ED visit. Within medical and trauma subgroups, there was no significant difference in the proportion (36%) of patients that could be screened upon presentation. Among the psychiatric presentations, only five (14%) were able to be screened during their hospital stay.
Triage protocols for high-acuity medico-surgical patients resulted in a missed opportunity to screen 48% of patients for HIV. Acute psychiatric patients represented a particular missed opportunity. We advocate for universal HIV screening, facilitated through electronic best practice advisories and a modified triage tailored to higher acuity patients. Implementing these changes would ensure that HIV screening is not overlooked in high-acuity ED patients, leading to early detection and timely interventions.","On average, 700 patients per month are announced on arrival via overhead page, indicating that they require immediate medical attention.

"The aim of the study is to assess associations between substance use and menopausal symptoms among US people living with and without HIV in a longitudinal cohort.
We analyzed self-reported menopausal symptoms and substance use from biannual Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) visits from 2008-2020. Substance use since the last visit or lifetime cumulative use included tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, crack/cocaine, and opioids. Logistic regression quantified associations between each substance use and menopausal symptom frequency (vasomotor, mood, and musculoskeletal), adjusting for other substance use, HIV status, demographics, comorbidities, and trauma.
A total of 1,949 participants contributed early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, or postmenopausal study visits.

"Rapid Start ensures that persons with HIV initiate antiretroviral therapy in less than seven days after diagnosis. Benefits of Rapid Start include timely linkage to medical care, viral suppression in a shorter time and improved retention to medical care. Despite these benefits, there is a slow uptake of Rapid Start, in New Jersey.
Identify barriers to Rapid Start among New Jersey providers.
An electronic survey, consisting of 28 questions, with the following domains was administered to New Jersey providers, using Qualtrics: provider and practice characteristics (10), knowledge (1), barriers (8) and attitudes to diverse patient types (9). The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics due to small numbers over strata. Approval to conduct the survey was obtained from the William Paterson University Institutional Review Board.
There were 69 responses to the survey. Providers were at least 45 years old (48%), female (44/60, 73%), nurse practitioners or physician assistants (41/59, 69%). Overall, 44/63 (70%) providers did not correctly identify that integrase inhibitors had the lowest prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. Newly diagnosed patients were referred for medical care in 37 (65%) of the medical sites. Only providers from Ryan White (federally funded clinics for persons with HIV) (64%) and non-Ryan White (73%) public sites reported co-located HIV testing sites. Seventy percent of medical sites offered same-day medical appointments. However, a lower proportion of private (62%), public Ryan White (55%), and other medical sites (36%) offered same-day appointments compared to public non-Ryan White sites (82%). Despite having staff available 40 h per week (91%), only 55% of Ryan White sites offered extended office hours in the early morning, evenings, or on Saturdays. When compared to providers in public non-Ryan White sites, a lower proportion of providers in Ryan White sites were comfortable doing Rapid Start either on the day of or within one week of diagnosis, 82% and 72%, respectively, or starting antiretroviral therapy before genotype results were available, 55% and 46%, respectively. Overall, providers were not comfortable with Rapid Start for persons engaging in condomless sex (60%).
Policy and administrative decisions are needed to eliminate barriers at the clinic level.

"Faced with declining donor funding for HIV, low- and middle-income countries must identify efficient and cost-effective ways to integrate HIV prevention programs into public health systems for long-term sustainability. In Zambia, donor support to the voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program, which previously funded non-governmental organizations as implementing partners, is increasingly being directed through government structures instead. We developed a framework to understand how the behaviors of individual decision-makers within the government could be barriers to this transition. We interviewed key stakeholders from the national, provincial, and district levels of the Ministry of Health, and from donors and partners funding and implementing Zambia's VMMC program, exploring the decisions required to attain a sustainable VMMC program and the behavioral dynamics involved at personal and institutional levels. Using pattern identification and theme matching to analyze the content of the responses, we derived three core decision-making phases in the transition to a sustainable VMMC program: 1) developing an alternative funding strategy, 2) developing a policy for early-infant (0-2 months) and early-adolescent (15-17 years) male circumcision, which is crucial to sustainable HIV prevention; and 3) identifying integrated and efficient implementation models. We formulated a framework showing how, in each phase, a range of behavioral dynamics can form barriers that hinder effective decision-making among stakeholders at the same level (e.g., national ministries and donors) or across levels (e.g., national, provincial and district). Our research methodology and the resulting framework offer a systematic approach for in-depth investigations into organizational decision-making in public health programs, as well as development programs beyond VMMC and HIV prevention. It provides the insights necessary to map organizational development and policy-making transition plans to sustainability, by explaining tangible factors such as organizational processes and systems, as well as intangibles such as the behaviors of policymakers and institutional actors.",,"[{'lastname': 'Gantayat', 'firstname': 'Nishan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baer', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'DesireLine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Gangaramany', 'firstname': 'Alok', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kretschmer', 'firstname': 'Steve', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'DesireLine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Surana', 'firstname': 'Rasi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Samona', 'firstname': 'Alick', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'DesireLine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Mukamba', 'firstname': 'Njekwa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Lusaka Province, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jere', 'firstname': 'Bright', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Lusaka Province, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chinsenga', 'firstname': 'Tina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Ministry of Health, Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Prasad', 'firstname': 'Ram', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goetschius', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Saransh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Final Mile Consulting, New York, New York, 10007, USA.'}]",Developing a framework for understanding policy decision-making behaviors in the transition of an HIV prevention program towards sustainability: a case study from Zambia's voluntary medical male circumcision program.
"Worldwide, there is an increase in the frequency of reports of psoas abscesses due to advances in imaging technology, which has led to early diagnosis and treatment. A bilateral psoas abscess is rare and, when it occurs, is usually secondary and in immunocompromised patients. We present a case of a bilateral tuberculosis psoas abscess in a human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient.
A 21-year-old Ugandan female undergraduate who contracted human immunodeficiency virus through vertical transmission and has been on highly active antiretroviral drugs presented with bilateral lower abdominal pain with associated fever and headache. Clinical examination revealed abdominal tenderness in both iliac fossae with palpable masses. Ultrasonography revealed fluid collection in both psoas muscles confirming bilateral abscesses. The aspirate was acid-fast bacilli positive. A diagnosis of bilateral tuberculosis psoas abscess was made. Open drainage was performed and antituberculosis drugs were commenced.
Bilateral tuberculosis psoas abscesses occurring in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients, although uncommon, is not unexpected.

"Differences in the cervicovaginal microbiome may influence the persistence of HPV and therefore, the progression to cervical cancer. We aimed to analyze and compare the metatranscriptome of cervical cancers positive for HPV 16 and 18 with those positive for other HPV types to understand the microbiome's influence on oncogenicity. RNA sequencing data from a total of 222 invasive cervical cancer cases (HPV16/18 positive (n=42) and HPV ""Other types"" (n=180)) were subjected to taxonomy classification (Kraken 2) including bacteria, virus and fungi to the level of species. With a median depth of 288,080.5 reads per sample, up to 107 species (38 bacterial, 16 viral and 53 fungal) were identified. Diversity analyses revealed no significant differences in viral or fungal species between HPV16/18 and other HPV types. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly higher in the ""Other HPV types"" group for the Observed index (p=0.0074) (but not for Shannon). Cumulative species curves revealed greater species diversity in the ""Other HPV types"" group compared to ""HPV16/18 but no significant differences in species abundance were found between HPV groups.

"The goal of our research programme is to develop culturally appropriate patient-specific interventions for primary and secondary prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) among people living with HIV (PLWH); PLWH are at a higher risk for OPC than the general population and, as with many cancers, there are disparities in OPC health outcomes by race and ethnicity. Our study incorporates an anti-racist research framework that proposes considering racism as a foundational sociocultural system that causes ill health. We expand the framework to include biases due to gender, sexual orientation, HIV status and membership in other non-dominant groups. Our research programme focuses on HPV-related OPC among people living with PLWH, and on how intersecting identities may impact an individual's experience with oral health, obtaining regular and appropriate oral healthcare, knowledge and perceptions of oral HPV infection, risk factors for OPC and HPV vaccination.
We will follow a grounded theory (GT) qualitative research methodology using focus group discussions (FGDs) to collect data. We will invite PLWH with intersecting identities to participate in one of 12-18 FGDs with 5-8 participants per group. Focus groups will be formed based on self-reported domains, including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation and other identities that could impact oral health, such as smoking status, experience with homelessness or experience with drug use disorders. We do not know which aspects of intersecting identities are most salient to accessing oral healthcare. Using FGDs will allow us to gain this knowledge in a setting where participants can build on and reinforce shared understandings about oral healthcare. Following our GT methodology, analysis will occur concurrently with data collection, and emerging concepts or theories may result in changes to focus group guide questions. Initial focus group questions will be organised around our main objectives: (1) to identify individual, interpersonal and structural health equity factors that serve as barriers or facilitators to oral health status and care; (2) to explore knowledge and perceptions about causes, risk factors, prevention and screening for oral or OPC and (3) to elicit recommendations for improving access to regular and appropriate oral healthcare and suggestions on engaging PLWH from diverse identity groups in prevention interventions.

"This study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict disengagement from HIV care, high viral load or death among people living with HIV (PLHIV) with the goal of enabling proactive support interventions in Tanzania. The algorithm addressed common challenges when applying ML to electronic medical record (EMR) data: (1) imbalanced outcome distribution; (2) heterogeneity across multisite EMR data and (3) evolving virological suppression thresholds.
Observational study using a national EMR database.
Conducted in two regions in Tanzania, using data from the National HIV Care database.
The study included over 6 million HIV care visit records from 295 961 PLHIV in two regions in Tanzania's National HIV Care database from January 2015 to May 2023.
Our ML model effectively identified PLHIV at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Key predictors included past disengagement from care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) status (which tracks a patient's engagement with ART across visits), age and time on ART. The downsampling approach we implemented effectively managed imbalanced data to reduce prediction bias. Site-specific algorithms performed better compared with a universal approach, highlighting the importance of tailoring ML models to local contexts. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the model's robustness to changes in viral load suppression thresholds.
ML models leveraging large-scale databases of patient data offer significant potential to identify PLHIV for interventions to enhance engagement in HIV care in resource-limited settings. Tailoring algorithms to local contexts and flexibility towards evolving clinical guidelines are essential for maximising their impact.","Our ML model effectively identified PLHIV at increased risk of adverse outcomes.

"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a significant public health concern globally, particularly affecting young women. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to reducing or stopping the continuous spread of infections and the development of associated complications. Syndromic management, which is commonly used for STIs, presents several barriers, particularly for young women. This protocol is for a study that aims to understand young women's preferences for a self-sampling intervention for STI diagnosis by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE will be conducted among young women residing in underserved urban communities in eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
The following attributes of a self-sampling intervention were identified through a Nominal Group Technique: accessibility, education, confidentiality, self-sampling method, youth-friendliness and cost. A pilot study involving 20 participants was conducted to refine the DCE questionnaire. A total of 196 young women from underserved communities will be recruited. The participants will be sampled from communities, stratified by settlement type and socioeconomic status. Data will be analysed using the multinomial logit model and mixed logit model to assess preferences and heterogeneity.
The study was approved by the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria. The study findings have the potential to inform policies for STI treatment and management to align healthcare services with user preferences.

"Youth in Southern Africa face a high burden of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, yet they exhibit low uptake of health care services.
The Zvatinoda! intervention, co-designed with youth, aims to increase the demand for and utilization of health services among 18-24-year-olds in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe.
The intervention utilized mobile phone-based discussion groups, complemented by ""ask the expert"" sessions. Peer facilitators, supported by an ""Auntie,"" led youth in anonymous online chats on health topics prioritized by the participants. Feedback on youth needs was compiled and shared with health care providers. The intervention was tested in a 12-week feasibility study involving 4 groups of 7 youth each, totaling 28 participants (n=14, 50%, female participants), to evaluate feasibility and acceptability. Mixed methods process evaluation data included pre- and postintervention questionnaires (n=28), in-depth interviews with participants (n=15) and peer facilitators (n=4), content from discussion group chats and expert guest sessions (n=24), facilitators' debrief meetings (n=12), and a log of technical challenges. Descriptive quantitative analysis and thematic qualitative analysis were conducted. The RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework was adapted to analyze and present findings on (1) reach, (2) potential efficacy, (3) adoption, (4) implementation, and (5) maintenance.
Mobile delivery facilitated engagement with diverse groups, even during COVID-19 lockdowns (reach). Health knowledge scores improved from pre- to postintervention across 9 measures. Preintervention scores varied from 14% (4/28) for contraception to 86% (24/28) for HIV knowledge. After the intervention, all knowledge scores reached 100% (28/28). Improvements were observed across 10 sexual and reproductive health (SRH) self-efficacy measures. The most notable changes were in the ability to start a conversation about SRH with older adults in the family, which increased from 50% (14/28) preintervention to 86% (24/28) postintervention. Similarly, the ability to use SRH services even if a partner does not agree rose from 57% (16/28) preintervention to 89% (25/28) postintervention. Self-reported attendance at a health center in the past 3 months improved from 32% (9/28) preintervention to 86% (24/28) postintervention (potential efficacy). Chat participation varied, largely due to network challenges and school/work commitments. The key factors facilitating peer learning were interaction with other youth, the support of an older, knowledgeable ""Auntie,"" and the anonymity of the platform. As a result of COVID-19 restrictions, regular feedback to providers was not feasible. Instead, youth conveyed their needs to stakeholders through summaries of key themes from chat groups and a music video presented at a final in-person workshop (adoption and implementation).

"Assisted partner services (APS) is an effective strategy for testing people with undiagnosed HIV but there is limited information on the relative reach and effectiveness of phone versus in-person contact.
We analyzed data from 31 facilities in Western Kenya providing APS to female index clients newly HIV-diagnosed, their male partners, and female partners of men newly HIV-diagnosed. APS providers attempted contacting partners using phone first and, if unsuccessful, in-person in the community. Using log-linear mixed models, we estimated relative risks (RR) between phone being the final contact method and partner characteristics and HIV outcomes.
From May 2018-March 2020, 2534 female index clients named 7614 male partners, of whom 772 (10.1%) tested positive and named an additional 4956 non-index female partners. Of 11,912 (94.7%) partners reached, 5179 (43.5%) were via phone and 6733 (56.5%) in-person. Of 8076 testing-eligible partners, 99.7% tested and 11.2% first-time tested. Of those tested, 13.1% were newly-diagnosed, of whom 87.0% linked to care. Newly-diagnosed partners were less likely to have been reached by phone vs. in-person (9.8% vs. 15.9%; adjusted RR:0.61, 95%CI:0.53-0.70). Being reached by phone was not significantly associated with testing, first-time testing, or linkage to care.

"Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically infection by Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Treponema pallidum, have an important burden worldwide. The use of doxycycline as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PREP or Doxy-PREP) or Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP or Doxy-PEP) might be effective as prophylaxis since it is effective against C. trachomatis and T. pallidum.
Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline as PREP or PEP against bacterial STIs (C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and Treponema pallidum).
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of a high-risk group of individuals was conducted to evaluate whether doxycycline is as effective as PREP or PEP in preventing bacterial STIs. The PubMed-MEDLINE, Cohrane, Scielo, and LILACS databases were searched for randomized clinical trials published up to March 2024. Data were extracted from published reports. Hazard Ratios (HRs) and Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% CI were pooled across trials.
The primary endpoints were any incidence of bacterial STIs and individual STI infections.
A total of four studies were included in the analysis, three of which evaluated Doxy-PEP and one evaluated Doxy-PREP. In the Doxy-PEP group, a total of 1182 participants were evaluated. In the pooled analysis of Doxy-PEP studies, the incidence of the first STI was lower in the Doxy-PEP group (HR = 0.538 [95% CI = 0.337-0.859]) (I2 = 77%; P-value <0.05). Regarding individual infections, only two studies were included. In the Doxy-PEP group, the incidence of individual infection of C. trachomatis was lower compared to controls (RR = 0.291 [95% CI = 0.093-0.911]) (I2 = 89%; P-value <0.05). Since only one study evaluated Doxy-PREP, it was not possible to calculate a meta-analysis index; however, the use of doxycycline as pre-exposure prophylaxis was associated with a decrease in the rate of any STI.
The use of Doxy-PEP might reduce the first STI, mainly C. trachomatis, if used within 72 h after condomless sex. The use of Doxy-PREP might also decrease the chance of any STI, however, only one study was evaluated.","A total of four studies were included in the analysis, three of which evaluated Doxy-PEP and one evaluated Doxy-PREP.

"While some experts recommend anal cancer screening for disproportionally affected populations including people living with HIV (PWH), condyloma acuminata, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated gynecologic dysplasia and cancers, and solid organ transplants, actual screening practices remain understudied. Our objective was to characterize anal cancer screening practices among higher-risk populations in an academic medical system with access to high-resolution anoscopy (HRA).
We extracted outpatient clinical data for the above populations from 01/01/2015 - 08/01/2022 at three sites of an academic medical system. Data included patients' demographics, medical comorbidities, and anal cytology and HPV testing results. We used chi-squared tests and logistic regression to assess for associations between patient characteristics and anal cancer screening.
Of 7654 patients, 6.3% received anal cytology screening at least once including 21.7% of PWH, 13.8% of people with condyloma acuminata, 1.1% of people with gynecologic cancers, and 0.5% of people with solid organ transplants. In multivariable analysis, Black patients were 46% less likely to receive screening than white patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.71), and cisgender women were 73% less likely to receive screening than cisgender men (95% CI 0.20-0.38). Of 485 individuals who received anal cytology screening, 37.5% were only screened once and 70.5% had abnormal cytology on one or more screenings.

"While self-sampling could help address anal cancer screening barriers, no studies have investigated annual engagement with this method or compared it to annual screening with a provider. Building on our baseline paper,(7) we compared annual anal screening engagement between home-based self-sampling and clinic-based clinician sampling.
The Prevent Anal Cancer Self-Swab Study recruited and randomized sexual and gender minority individuals 25 years and over who have sex with men to a home or clinic arm. Home-based participants were mailed an anal human papillomavirus self-sampling kit at baseline and 12 months, while clinic-based participants were asked to schedule and attend one of five participating clinics at baseline and 12 months. Using Poisson regression, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of 240 randomized participants who were invited to screen at both timepoints.
58.8% of participants completed annual (median = 370 days) anal screening. In the home arm, 65.0% of participants engaged in annual screening compared to 52.5% of clinic-based participants (p = 0.049).

"The 2022 mpox outbreak disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Mpox cases continue to be reported nationally. Vaccination is a tool to prevent the spread of and serious disease from mpox. To understand mpox vaccine uptake and hesitancy, a virtual focus group with unvaccinated GBMSM was conducted.
In November 2022, a 60-minute, virtual focus group was conducted within an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that engages participants in chat-based conversation. The AI system uses machine learning and natural language processing to analyze and provide results immediately to the moderator. Descriptive frequencies, cross-tabulations and qualitative themes were analyzed.
Fifty-one GBMSM ages 18-55 participated, of whom 12 had attempted to get the mpox vaccine. The top barriers in accessing the vaccine included challenges in scheduling appointments (4/12), available vaccine locations (3/12), and transportation (2/12). Nine participants reported not wanting the vaccine and 22 were undecided; Of these, 15 (4/9 and 11/22, respectively) said they did not think they needed the vaccine due to low perceived risk or monogamy.. Among the undecided, after receiving health messaging about mpox, 12/22 said the messaging made them reconsider getting the vaccine.
During an outbreak, many unvaccinated GBMSM who may be at increased risk for mpox either wanted the vaccine or, with appropriate health messaging, may be open to getting the vaccine.

"There is growing interest in novel sexually transmissible infection (STI) prevention strategies, including doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP). We assessed interest in doxy-PEP and other STI prevention strategies among gay and bisexual men and non-binary people in Australia, as well as prior antibiotic use for STI prevention, and knowledge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
We conducted a national, online survey in June-July 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the acceptability of doxy-PEP.
Of 2,046 participants, 26.9% had been diagnosed with an STI in the previous year. Condoms were rated as an acceptable STI prevention strategy by 45.1% of the sample, STI pre-exposure prophylaxis by 54.0%, and doxy-PEP by 75.8%. Previous antibiotic use for STI prevention was reported by 7.5% of the sample, and 2.6% were currently using antibiotics for STI prevention. Over half the sample (62.1%) had some knowledge of AMR. Of those who knew something about AMR,76.2% were concerned about it. Interest in using doxy-PEP was independently associated with previous use of antibiotics for STI prevention (adjusted odds ratio 3.09, 95%CI = 1.78-5.35, p < 0.001), while those who were concerned about AMR were less interested in it (AOR 0.51, 95%CI = 0.36-0.72, p < 0.001).

"Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common neurological problem in HIV/AIDS Patients. It represents a complex symptom that occurs because of peripheral nerve damage related to advanced HIV disease and in association with the use of antiretroviral therapy. DSP is a frequent symptom in which the specific pathophysiology is not well understood. Recently, mitochondrial toxicity and antiretroviral toxic neuropathies have been more identified as a possible etiology of DSP. This study's objective was to determine factors associated with DSP severity in HIV/AIDS patients. This cross-sectional study was followed by 50 HIV/AIDS outpatients at some hospitals in Makassar, Indonesia who met the inclusion criteria. DSP is diagnosed using non-invasive screening tools subjective peripheral neuropathy screen (SPNS) which can determine the severity of DSP in advance. Some factors were analyzed by using Pearson's chi-square test and Spearman's correlation test. Forty-three participants (86%) had diagnosed DSP which is mostly moderate in severity (48%). Statistical analysis showed significant correlation between HIV/AIDS Stage and DSP severity (p=0.032) meanwhile CD4 count, antiretroviral, body mass index (BMI), and hemoglobin level have no significant correlation to DSP severity.

"Differentiating risk for HIV infection is important for providing focussed prevention options to individuals. We conducted a longitudinal study to validate a risk-differentiation tool for predicting HIV or HSV-2 acquisition among HIV-negative youth.
Population-based household survey in east Zimbabwe.
HIV and HSV-2 status and HIV behavioural risk factors were assessed in two surveys conducted 12 months apart among young people. Associations between risk-behaviours and combined HIV/HSV-2 incident infection were estimated using proportional hazards models. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of risk-differentiation questions in predicting HIV/HSV-2 acquisition and quantified changes between surveys among low, medium, and high-risk categories.
In total, 44 HIV/HSV-2 seroconversions were observed in 1812 person-years of follow up (2.43/100PY, 95%CI: 1.71-3.15); 50% of incident cases reported never having had sex at baseline. Risk of HIV/HSV-2 acquisition was higher for those reporting non-regular partners (women: HR=2.71, 95% CI:1.12-6.54, men: HR=1.37, 95%CI: 0.29-6.38) and those reporting having a partner with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) (HR=7.62 (1.22-47.51). Adding a question on non-regular partnerships increased tool sensitivity from 18.2% to 38.6%, and further to 77.3% when restricted to those who had ever had sex. Individual risk category increased for 28% of men and 17% of women over 12-months.
The refined risk differentiation tool identified a high proportion of youth at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite this, half of incident infections were among individuals who reported no prior sexual activity. The shifting patterns of risk behaviours underscore the need for dynamic prevention engagement strategies in high HIV prevalence or incidence settings.","In total, 44 HIV/HSV-2 seroconversions were observed in 1812 person-years of follow up (2.43/100PY, 95%CI: 1.71-3.15); 50% of incident cases reported never having had sex at baseline.

"Knowledge and use of sexual reproductive health and human immunodeficiency virus (SRH and HIV) services are crucial for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). This study aims to assess the knowledge and perceptions of AGYW about the SRH and HIV services offered in health facilities in Maputo, Mozambique.
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted based on exit surveys with AGYW held at Zimpeto and 1° de Junho Health Facilities in Maputo City, between May 1, and June 9, 2023. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, t-test and ANOVA, using SPSS version 20.
590 AGYW, aged 15-24 years of age, were included in the study. In general, knowledge of SRH and HIV services was fairly high, with knowledge of each specific service offered ranging between 38% and 97%. Knowledge about SRH and HIV services differed depending on the health facility where the AGYW sought SRH and HIV services; the participant's age; their occupation; their religion, and who they lived with. Counseling services were the most commonly reported services attended, with >90% of participants reporting having received counseling for each of the following: STI and HIV and pregnancy prevention, sexuality, and safer sex practices. The quality of SRH and HIV services, and attitudes of the providers were considered good by >90% of AGYW. Roughly 95% of AGYW at Zimpeto Health Facility were either ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"". Whereas at 1° de Junho Health Facility, only roughly 75% of AGYW were either ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"", and roughly 20% of AGYW were ""little satisfied that their needs had been met that day.

"Prospective, multicentric observational cohort study in Switzerland investigating measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission in pregnant women with HIV (WWH) and assessing health and development of their exposed children as well as of children with HIV (CWH) in general.
Between January 1986 and December 2022, a total of 1446 mother-child pairs were enrolled. During the same period, the study also registered 187 CWH and 521 HIV-exposed but uninfected children (HEU), for whom detailed maternal information was not available. Consequently, the cohort comprises a total of 2154 children.
During these 37 years, research by the Swiss Mother and Child HIV Cohort Study (MoCHiV) and its international collaborators has strongly influenced the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV (eg, introduction and discontinuation of elective caesarean section, neonatal postexposure prophylaxis and breastfeeding). Contributions have also been made to the management of diagnostics (eg, p24 antigen assay) and the effects of antiretroviral treatment (eg, prematurity, growth) in HEU and CWH.

Patients treated for several haematological malignancies have further compromised immune systems. Furthermore, many chemotherapies, alone or associated with haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, make the body's natural barriers extremely fragile. STIs can negatively impact both patient morbidity and mortality. In this Series paper, we discuss Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, human papilloma virus, and hepatitis B virus, as we found them to be associated with increased risks for haematological malignancy treatments, either by incidence or by severity.

"HIV prevention is a public health priority. Despite progress in recent years, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use remains suboptimal especially among groups disproportionately impacted by new HIV diagnoses such as gender and sexual minorities of color. Multiple barriers including a lack of PrEP providers and challenges with attending quarterly monitoring visits contribute to low PrEP uptake and retention. Home-based PrEP (HB-PrEP) services could reduce stigma, increase convenience, expand health system capacity for PrEP care, and improve PrEP retention.
Home Option Testing for PrEP (HOT4PrEP) is a hybrid randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to examine whether HB-PrEP care is acceptable to PrEP users, feasible to implement in a sexual health clinic setting, and impacts PrEP retention.
The RCT will recruit 458 persons currently taking or soon to initiate PrEP at a sexual health clinic in Seattle, Washington, and randomize them to continue the standard of care or have the option to use HB-PrEP for 2 of 3 triannual PrEP follow-up visits. Participants in the intervention arm will be sent home kits containing gonorrhea and chlamydia swabs and Tasso devices for blood self-collection. The primary outcome is PrEP retention between groups at 20 months; secondary outcomes include user satisfaction and acceptability, feasibility, self-reported PrEP adherence, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence. Interviews with PrEP users and clinic staff will elucidate barriers and facilitators of implementation.
The HOT4PrEP RCT began enrolling in March 2022, was on hold during the height of the US mpox epidemic, then resumed enrollment in December 2022. Of the first 100 enrollees, the median age is 34 years, and most are cisgender gay men (89/100, 89%) with at least some college education (91/100, 91%). Among the 49 participants randomized to the HB-PrEP option, 33 (67%) chose to self-collect samples at home at least once, of whom 27 (82%) successfully returned test kits for HIV and STI testing. Primary PrEP retention and qualitative analyses are ongoing.
Implementation of HB-PrEP into a high-volume sexual health clinic seems to be feasible and acceptable to early RCT enrollees. This strategy has the potential to address individual and systemic barriers associated with initiating and persisting on PrEP, such as increasing sexual health agency and expanding clinical capacity to serve greater numbers of PrEP users.

"Despite receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), an increasing number of adolescents and young adults with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIVAYA) are at risk of developing premature senescence and aging-associated illnesses, including cancer. Given this concern, it is crucial to assess aging biomarkers and their correlation with the HIV reservoir in order to comprehensively characterize and monitor these individuals. Fifty-five PHIVAYA (median age: 23, interquartile range [IQR]: 20-27 years, and 21 [18-23] years on ART at the time of study sampling) were studied along with 23 age-matched healthy controls. The PHIVAYA exhibited significantly higher percentages of activated, senescent, exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, shorter telomeres, reduced thymic output, and higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers (PAMPs, DAMPs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα) as well as denervation biomarkers (neural cell adhesion molecule 1 [NCAM1] and C-terminal Agrin fragment [CAF]), compared to controls. HIV-DNA levels positively correlated with activated, senescent, exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, circulating biomarkers levels, and inversely with regulatory T and B cells and telomere length. According to their viremia over time, PHIVAYA were subgrouped into 14 Not Suppressed (NS)-PHIVAYA and 41 Suppressed (S)-PHIVAYA, of whom 6 who initiated ART within one year of age and maintained sustained viral suppression overtime were defined as Early Suppressed (ES)-PHIVAYA and the other 35 as Late Suppressed (LS)-PHIVAYA. ES-PHIVAYA exhibited significantly lower HIV-DNA reservoir, decreased percentages of senescent and exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, reduced levels of circulating inflammatory and denervation biomarkers, but longer telomere compared to LS- and NS-PHIVAYA. They differed significantly from healthy controls only in a few markers, including higher percentages of regulatory T and B cells, and higher levels of DAMPs. Overall, these results underscore the importance of initiating ART early and maintaining viral suppression to limit the establishment of the viral reservoir and to counteract immune and cellular premature aging. These findings also suggest new approaches for minimally invasive monitoring of individuals at high risk of developing premature aging and age-related illnesses.",,"[{'lastname': 'Petrara', 'firstname': 'Maria Raffaella', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.\nOncology and Immunology Section, Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruffoni', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Carmona', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cavallari', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zampieri', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Morello', 'firstname': 'Marzia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Bianco', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rampon', 'firstname': 'Osvalda', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Cotugno', 'firstname': 'Nicola', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Clinical and Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Roma, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Palma', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Clinical and Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Roma, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Clinical and Research Unit of Clinical Immunology and Vaccinology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Roma, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Giaquinto', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Giunco', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.\nOncology and Immunology Section, Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'De Rossi', 'firstname': 'Anita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.\nOncology and Immunology Section, Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}]",HIV reservoir and premature aging: risk factors for aging-associated illnesses in adolescents and young adults with perinatally acquired HIV.
"Transgender women (hereafter ""trans women"") face social marginalization, stigma, and discrimination and experience a high burden of HIV. More recently, trans women have been identified as having a high risk for hepatitis C (HCV) infection. The interaction between these two diseases and the risks for HIV/HCV co-infection among trans women are understudied.
To characterize epidemiological, behavioral, and socio-structural interactions between HIV and HCV infections among trans women.
This cross-sectional study examined data from a community-based survey of trans women in San Francisco recruited through respondent-driven sampling (RDS) in 2019/2020. Face-to-face interviews collected data on demographics, medical history, drug injection practices, sexual behavior, and socio-structural factors (e.g., poverty, housing insecurity, incarceration, social support). HIV and HCV antibodies were detected using oral fluid rapid tests and prior diagnosis and treatment were collected by self-report. Blood specimens were collected to confirm antibodies using ELISA. Multinomial logistic regression analysis characterized factors associated with HIV infection alone, HCV infection alone, and HIV/HCV co-infection compared to neither infection.
Among 201 trans women recruited, HIV prevalence was 42.3%; HCV infection by history or current seroprevalence was 28.9%; evidence for both HIV and HCV infection was present for 18.9%. Two-thirds of trans women (67.2%) had been incarcerated; 30.8% had ever injected drugs. History of injection drug use and receiving emotional support from family were factors found in common for HIV infection, HCV infection, and HIV/HCV co-infection compared to no infection. Having a sexual partner who injects drugs was associated with HIV infection alone. Not lacking care due to cost and older age were associated with co-infection. Older age was also associated with HCV infection. Of trans women with HIV infection, 91.8% had accessed HIV care, whereas only 62% with HCV had accessed some form of care.
Our study found high levels of HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection among trans women in San Francisco. We found common associations between HIV and HCV through injection practices and emotional support, but having a sexual partner who injects drugs was not associated with HCV infection alone or co-infection. We note a substantial gap in the treatment of HCV for trans women, including those in HIV care, that needs to be urgently addressed.","Among 201 trans women recruited, HIV prevalence was 42.3%; HCV infection by history or current seroprevalence was 28.9%; evidence for both HIV and HCV infection was present for 18.9%.

"This study aims to clarify the pathogenic mechanism of interstitial cystitis (IC), which has led to uncertainty in its diagnosis and treatment. We examined data from 18 interstitial cystitis with Hunner lesions (HIC) and 18 interstitial cystitis without Hunner lesions (NHIC) patients, including their clinical information, urodynamic test results, and maximum bladder capacity. A 1-year follow-up tracked disease progression. Postoperative recovery showed that HIC patients experienced significantly greater improvements in Visual Analog Scale pain scores compared to NHIC patients (P = .0049). This trend continued at the 6-month mark (P = .0056). Over the 1-year follow-up, NHIC patients exhibited a statistically significant improvement in Pain and Urgency/Frequency scores, while HIC patients had a gradual overall score increase from preoperative to postoperative stages. However, no significant differences were observed in either group at 1 year postoperatively compared to preoperative scores. This study revealed distinct differences between HIC and NHIC patients, including reduced bladder volumes and more severe nociceptive pain in HIC patients. Early analgesic interventions effectively alleviated discomfort in HIC patients. The combination of cystoscopic hydrodistention and water dilatation was highly effective in relieving pain symptoms in HIC patients but increased the risk of recurrence, necessitating recurrent bladder infusion and timely therapeutic adjustments.

"Across Canada, Child Protection Services (CPS) disrupt Indigenous families by apprehending their children at alarmingly high rates. The harms borne by children in out-of-home care (OoHC) have been extensively documented. We examined the impact of OoHC on Manitoba children's health and legal system outcomes to provide rigorous evidence on how discretionary decision-making by CPS agencies can affect these outcomes.
In partnership with First Nations researchers, we used linked administrative data to identify Manitoba children (born 2007-2018) served by First Nations and other Manitoba CPS agencies. We compared those taken into OoHC (n = 19,324) with those never in care but with an open CPS file due to child protection concerns (n = 27,290). We used instrumental variable analysis (CPS agency rates of OoHC as the instrument) to obtain odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for child, maternal, and family factors.
Mean age (yrs ± standard deviation) at first CPS contact for children taken into OoHC was 2.8 ± 3.7 (First Nations) and 3.0 ± 3.8 (other), and for children never in care was 4.5 ± 4.5 (First Nations) and 5.1 ± 4.7 (other). Among children served by a First Nations agency, males made up 50.6% (n = 5496) in OoHC and 51.0% (n = 6579) never in care. Among children served by other agencies, males made up 51.0% (n = 4324) in OoHC and 51.0% (n = 7428) never in care.

"Describe the proportion of people newly living with HIV with sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) before, at, and after HIV diagnosis in Manitoba, Canada.
A retrospective cohort study reviewed clinical charts of all 404 people ≥18 years old newly diagnosed with HIV in Manitoba, Canada between 2018 and 2021. Syphilis, hepatitis C and B, gonorrhea, and chlamydia infections before, at, and after HIV diagnosis were recorded and analyzed by sex at birth, injection drug use status, use of methamphetamines, and housing status.
A total of 53% of people were diagnosed with syphilis, 44.1% with gonorrhea, 42.8% with chlamydia, and 40.6% with hepatitis C at least once. Among females, 64.1% had at least one or more STBBIs diagnoses before HIV diagnosis compared with 44.8% of males. Over 70% of people experiencing houselessness had at least one STBBI diagnosis before their HIV diagnosis compared with 43.9% of people not houseless. Among people who used methamphetamines, 68.3% had one or more STBBIs before HIV diagnosis compared with 28.9% of people who do not use methamphetamines. In a multivariable analysis houselessness, methamphetamine use, and younger age were associated with increased risk of any STBBIs.
In our Manitoba cohort of people living with HIV, disproportionately more females, people experiencing houselessness, and those who use methamphetamine were diagnosed with STBBIs. The proportion of new infections before HIV diagnoses highlights a missed opportunity to provide prevention modalities, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, and the proportion after HIV diagnosis emphasizes the importance of enhancing engagement, repeated testing, and educational strategies to ameliorate ongoing exposures.","A total of 53% of people were diagnosed with syphilis, 44.1% with gonorrhea, 42.8% with chlamydia, and 40.6% with hepatitis C at least once.

Supported by the Empilweni Services and Research Unit, maternal and infant data from 13 654 pregnant women living with HIV who delivered their infants (and a subset also attended antenatal care) were collected at RMMCH in Johannesburg, South Africa since 2013. Maternal data were collected using counsellor-administered interviews and the 2013-2018 subset of this cohort was linked to the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) national HIV cohort-a longitudinal cohort of people living with HIV accessing care in the public sector antiretroviral therapy programme in South Africa that can observe national access to HIV care through laboratory testing data.
Topics addressed by the cohort include antenatal care history, HIV treatment exposure, delivery/birth management, prophylaxis and maternal blood results relevant to HIV captured at delivery. The cohort was also one of the first to describe implementation of early infant diagnosis procedures in South Africa including evaluations of novel point-of-care testing strategies demonstrating improvements in uptake of HIV care among infants accessing point-of-care services.

"After rapid epidemic growth between May and August, 2022, new mpox diagnoses declined in Europe and the Americas, with low-level transmission continuing thereafter. Characterising the extent of behavioural adaptation, mpox vaccination, and mpox prevalence across these regions could improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus. We aimed to characterise the presence and duration of adaptations to sexual behaviour related to the emergence of mpox during the first year of the outbreak among affected communities in Europe and the Americas.
This retrospective, cross-sectional online survey was conducted in 23 countries in Europe and the Americas between May 19 and May 31, 2023. The survey was advertised via four geospatial dating apps used by affected communities. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and identified as a gay man, a bisexual man, a man who has sex with men, as transgender, or as non-binary. We described and regionally compared the mpox prevalence, mpox vaccination rates (one dose or two doses of modified vaccinia virus Bavarian Nordic), and the extent and duration of behavioural adaptation during the outbreak. For these behavioural outcomes, we used regression analyses to estimate crude prevalence ratios (PRs) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% CIs.
Of 17 428 individuals who completed the survey, 16 875 (96·8%) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. 1086 (6·4%) participants reported having mpox during the outbreak. Vaccination with at least one dose was reported by 4987 (29·6%) participants; 3502 (20·8%) reported two doses. Vaccination rates in Latin America and eastern Europe and the western Balkans were significantly lower than in western Europe and northern America (p<0·0001). Adaptations to sexual behaviour were reported by 8583 (50·9%) of 16 875 participants and across all regions; 3045 (35·5%) of these 8583 participants said they continued adapting their sexual behaviour until May, 2023. Participants who reported concerns about mpox (9884 [58·6%] of 16 875) were more likely to adapt their behaviour than those who did not report concerns (PR 2·43 [95% CI 2·34-2·53]). In adjusted regression models, participants who reported vaccination (aPR 0·25 [95% CI 0·21-0·28] for two doses and 0·43 [0·37-0·51] for one dose) or having had mpox (0·37 [0·30-0·44]) were less likely to continue adaptations than those who did not. Participants in Latin America or northern America were significantly more likely to adapt their sexual behaviour and to continue with adaptations than those in western Europe.
Adaptations to sexual behaviour due to mpox were widespread, dynamic, and responded to evolving individual risk perceptions. We propose that the decline in mpox transmission seen at the end of 2022 resulted primarily from a combination of behavioural adaptation and naturally acquired immunity. As mpox vaccination is an important preventive measure, stark vaccine inequity highlights the need to increase access to mpox vaccines.

The present study describes bovine papillomavirus infection in cattle on clinco-pathological and molecular bases and compares the identified strains with the previously characterized papillomavirus isolates in Egypt either of bovine or equine origin. Out of sixty examined cattle, skin lesions were collected from eleven clinically diseased cattle exhibiting typical papillomatosis clinical signs and subjected to histopathological and molecular identification. Histological sections showed well-developed papillary projections of squamous epithelium associated with fibrovascular stroma. Type 1 bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) was identified in the cutaneous lesions based on the results of L1 gene-based PCR using degenerated primer followed by DNA sequencing. Comparative sequence and evolutionary analysis revealed that papilloma sequences (OP777901, OP777902, OP777903) obtained in the current study are clustered along with MW018705.1, MG547343.1isolated from cattle in Egypt in 2017/2018 and MT502095.1.1, and MT502105.1 isolated from equine in Egypt in 2019.

"In Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, infection rates for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are three to ten times higher than the national averages and have been steadily increasing. However, data are scarce on the socioeconomic, psychological, and behavioural factors associated with the proliferation of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in NWT. To this extent, this study explores Indigenous mothers' perspectives on sexual health, STI risk factors and healthcare-seeking behaviours in NWT.
Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Participants consisted of Indigenous mothers who were pregnant or had given birth within three years.
Of the 161 participants, with a mean age of 29.61 years, 70.81% lived with a partner, and 93.17% had given birth within the previous three years. Participants felt STIs were a concern (68.32%) and felt comfortable asking a male partner for safe sexual relations (67.70%). The healthcare system was the main source of STI information for most participants (83.85%). The main STI risk factors participants mentioned were young age, unsafe sexual relations, and substance use. Participants reported embarrassment, protecting personal and familial well-being, and confidentiality as factors affecting STI healthcare-seeking behaviour.
STIs result from an interaction between age, sexual behaviour, substance use, health literacy, and the historical and sociocultural contexts stigmatizing STIs and impacting women's abilities to demand safe sexual relations. Understanding these factors in a remote Indigenous context is vital to designing and implementing effective health and social interventions to reduce the prevalence of STIs in NWT.","Of the 161 participants, with a mean age of 29.61 years, 70.81% lived with a partner, and 93.17% had given birth within the previous three years.

Access to sexual health and sexual well-being (SHSW) services, which include the prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections, contraception and the support of sexual function, pleasure and safety, is important for the health of midlife women, their relationships and community cohesion. The objective was to use the socio-ecological model to synthesise the barriers and enablers to SHSW services for midlife women in high-income countries. A systematic review of the enablers and barriers to women (including trans-gender and non-binary people) aged 40-65 years accessing SHSW services in high-income countries was undertaken. Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar) were searched for peer-reviewed publications. Findings were thematically extracted and reported in a narrative synthesis. Eighty-one studies were included; a minority specifically set out to study SHSW care for midlife women. The key barriers that emerged were the intersecting disadvantage of under-served groups, poor knowledge, about SHSW, and SHSW services, among women and their healthcare professionals (HCPs), and the over-arching effect of stigma, social connections and psychological factors on access to care. Enablers included intergenerational learning, interdisciplinary and one-stop women-only services, integration of SHSW into other services, peer support programmes, representation of minoritised midlife women working in SHSW, local and free facilities and financial incentives to access services for under-served groups. Efforts are needed to enhance education about SHSW and related services among midlife women and their healthcare providers. This increased education should be leveraged to improve research, public health messaging, interventions, policy development and access to comprehensive services, especially for midlife women from underserved groups.",,"[{'lastname': 'Simmons', 'firstname': 'Kiersten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Llewellyn', 'firstname': 'Carrie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bremner', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilleece', 'firstname': 'Yvonne', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Norcross', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwuji', 'firstname': 'Collins', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Global Health and Infection Department, Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, UK.\nAfrica Health Institute, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.'}]",The barriers and enablers to accessing sexual health and sexual well-being services for midlife women (aged 40-65 years) in high-income countries: A mixed-methods systematic review.
"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for the most common sexually transmitted infection, particularly among sexually active individuals. Understanding the geographical distribution and epidemiology of the most prevalent HPV genotypes is essential for developing effective prevention strategies. Consequently, this study aimed to examine the distribution of HPV genotypes among HPV-positive women and men in Sari, the capital city of Mazandaran province in northern Iran.
HPV DNA was extracted (PZP Company, Molecular IVD, Iran) from genital and cervical samples of the study participants. Genotyping was conducted for 90 cases utilizing the High + Low Papilloma Strip test (Operon Company, Spain). Demographic data were statistically analyzed in correlation with the virological data (STATA version 17).
Overall, 67.7% (61 out of 90) of the cases tested positive for HPV, with 75% of those being classified as high-risk. The participant group consisted of 92% females (83) and 8% males (7). The highest HPV prevalence, 75% (36), was observed in females and males aged under 31, with the majority of positive cases belonging to high-risk genotypes. The most frequently identified genotypes were HPV-11 (23%), HPV-6 (21%), HPV-56 (18%), HPV-39 (16%), HPV-16, HPV-91, and HPV-66 each comprising (14%). HPV-56 was the most common high-risk genotype, accounting for 11 cases (18%), followed by HPV-39, which was present in 10 cases (16%).
The prevalence of HPV infection was particularly high among individuals under the age of 31 for both genders, with men exhibiting a 100% infection rate. These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted education aimed at the younger population and the implementation of infection control measures. Specifically, widespread HPV vaccination targeting HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-39, and HPV-56 should be prioritized for the general population.","Overall, 67.7% (61 out of 90) of the cases tested positive for HPV, with 75% of those being classified as high-risk.

"The risk of cervical cancer progression in high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-positive women is associated with cervical lesion severity and molecular heterogeneity. Classification systems based on p16 and Ki67 expression cumulative scores (0-3 each)-p16/Ki67 collectively known as an immunoscore [IS]-are an accurate and reproducible method for grading cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions. Meanwhile, DNA methylation is an early event in the development of cervical cancer. Hence, this study evaluated the relationship among CIN, p16/Ki-67 IS, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation.
In this study, 414 HPV-positive paraffin-embedded specimens were collected, and PAX1/ZNF582 methylation and the p16/ki67 IS were determined. A total of 43 invalid samples were excluded and 371 were included in the statistical analyses. There were 103 cervicitis, 95 CIN1, 71 CIN2, 89 CIN3, and 13 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases.

"High rates of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy continue to plague young adults in the USA with low condom use a contributing factor. To better understand condom acquisition, errors, and breakage among US cisgender college students, a survey was conducted across six structurally diverse institutions of higher education in 2019-2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students who had used external condoms in the last year (N = 1584) were asked about specific on- and off-campus locations of condom acquisition and practices related to condom use. Findings indicate that students most frequently acquired condoms off-campus with location differences between genders and relationship status. Condom errors were common, with no consistent patterns related to gender, but unpartnered students were more likely than those in relationships to experience condom errors. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that relationship status, applying condom on wrong side, adding condom after sex started, removing condom during sex, condom slipping off, and problems with fit were predictors for condom breakage. The study results provide guidance for healthcare and sexuality education professionals working with college students to better address the differing needs of college students regarding condom acquisition and correct condom use.",,"[{'lastname': 'Butler', 'firstname': 'Scott M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'School of Health & Human Performance, Georgia College & State University, Milledgeville, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Oswalt', 'firstname': 'Sara B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, One UTSA Circle, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA. sara.oswalt@utsa.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Charmayne M L', 'initials': 'CML', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universität Berlin, Age-Appropriate Human-Machine Systems, Institute of Psychology and Ergonomics, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Robbins', 'firstname': 'Charlotte Petonic', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Health Promotion and Wellness, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sundstrom', 'firstname': 'Beth', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Communication, College of Charleston, Charleston, SC, USA.'}]","Condom Acquisition, Errors, and Breakage among U.S. Cisgender College Students."
"Undiagnosed HIV and schistosomiasis are highly prevalent among fishermen in the African Great Lakes region. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lakeside interventions integrating services for HIV and male genital schistosomiasis on the prevalence of schistosomiasis, uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) among fishermen in Malawi.
We conducted a three-arm, cluster-randomised trial in 45 lakeshore fishing communities (clusters) in Mangochi, Malawi. Clusters were defined geographically by their home community as the place where fishermen leave their boats (ie, a landing site). Eligible participants were male fishermen (aged ≥18 years) who resided in a cluster. Clusters were randomly allocated (1:1:1) through computer-generated random numbers to either enhanced standard of care (SOC), which offered invitation with information leaflets to a beach clinic offering HIV testing and referral, and presumptive treatment for schistosomiasis with praziquantel; peer education (PE), in which a nominated fisherman was responsible for explaining the study leaflet to promote services to his boat crew; or peer distribution education (PDE), in which the peer educator explained the leaflet and distributed HIV self-test kits to his boat crew. The beach clinic team and fishermen were not masked to intervention allocation; however, investigators were masked until the final analysis. Coprimary composite outcomes were the proportion of participants who had at least one Schistosoma haematobium egg observed on light microscopy from 10 mL of urine filtrate and the proportion who had self-reported initiating ART or scheduling VMMC by day 28. Outcomes were analysed by intention to treat; multiple imputation for missing outcomes was done; random-effect binomial models adjusting for baseline imbalance and clustering were used to compute unadjusted and adjusted risk differences, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs, and intracluster correlation coefficients for each outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN14354324.
Between March 1, 2022, and Jan 29, 2023, 45 (65·2%) of 69 clusters assessed for eligibility were enrolled in the trial, with 15 clusters per arm. Of the 6036 fishermen screened at baseline, 5207 (86·3%) were eligible for participation: 1745 (87·6%) of 1991 in the enhanced SOC group, 1687 (81·9%) of 2061 in the PE group, and 1775 (89·5%) of 1984 in the PDE group. Compared with the prevalence of active schistosomiasis in the enhanced SOC group (292 [16·7%] of 1745), 241 (13·6%) of 1775 fishermen in the PDE group (adjusted RR 0·80 [95% CI 0·69-0·94]; p=0·0054) and 263 (15·6%) of 1687 fishermen in the PE group (0·92 [0·79-1·07]; p=0·28) had schistosomiasis at day 28. 230 (13·2%) in the enhanced SOC group, 281 (16·7%) in the PE group, and 215 (12·1%) in the PDE group initiated ART or were scheduled for VMMC. ART initiation or VMMC scheduling was not significantly increased with the PDE intervention (0·88 [0·74-1·05); p=0·15) and was marginally increased with the PE intervention (1·16 [0·99-1·37]; p=0·069) when compared with the enhanced SOC group. No serious adverse events were reported in this trial.
We found weak evidence for the use of peer education to increase uptake of ART and VMMC, but strong evidence for the added distribution of HIV self-test kits to promote high engagement with services and reduce the prevalence of active schistosomiasis, suggesting a high potential for scale-up in hard-to-reach communities across Malawi.

"Malawi is progressing towards UNAIDS and WHO End TB Strategy targets to eliminate HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We aimed to assess the prospective effect of achieving these goals on the health and health system of the country and the influence of consumable constraints.
In this modelling study, we used the Thanzi la Onse (Health for All) model, which is an individual-based multi-disease simulation model that simulates HIV and tuberculosis transmission, alongside other diseases (eg, malaria, non-communicable diseases, and maternal diseases), and gates access to essential medicines according to empirical estimates of availability. The model integrates dynamic disease modelling with health system engagement behaviour, health system use, and capabilities (ie, personnel and consumables). We used 2018 data on the availability of HIV and tuberculosis consumables (for testing, treatment, and prevention) across all facility levels of the country to model three scenarios of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up from Jan 1, 2023, to Dec 31, 2033: a baseline scenario, when coverage remains static using existing consumable constraints; a constrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with fixed consumable constraints; and an unconstrained scenario, in which prioritised interventions are scaled up with maximum availability of all consumables related to HIV and tuberculosis care.
With uninterrupted medical supplies, in Malawi, we projected HIV and tuberculosis incidence to decrease to 26 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 19-35) cases and 55 (23-74) cases per 100 000 person-years by 2033 (from 152 [98-195] cases and 123 [99-160] cases per 100 000 person-years in 2023), respectively, with programme scale-up, averting a total of 12·21 million (95% UI 11·39-14·16) disability-adjusted life-years. However, the effect was compromised by restricted access to key medicines, resulting in approximately 58 700 additional deaths (33 400 [95% UI 22 000-41 000] due to AIDS and 25 300 [19 300-30 400] due to tuberculosis) compared with the unconstrained scenario. Between 2023 and 2033, eliminating HIV treatment stockouts could avert an estimated 12 100 deaths compared with the baseline scenario, and improved access to tuberculosis prevention medications could prevent 5600 deaths in addition to those achieved through programme scale-up alone. With programme scale-up under the constrained scenario, consumable stockouts are projected to require an estimated 14·3 million extra patient-facing hours between 2023 and 2033, mostly from clinical or nursing staff, compared with the unconstrained scenario. In 2033, with enhanced screening, 188 000 (81%) of 232 900 individuals projected to present with active tuberculosis could start tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of initial presentation if all required consumables were available, but only 8600 (57%) of 15 100 presenting under the baseline scenario.
Ignoring frailties in the health-care system, in particular the potential non-availability of consumables, in projections of HIV and tuberculosis programme scale-up might risk overestimating potential health impacts and underestimating required health system resources. Simultaneous health system strengthening alongside programme scale-up is crucial, and should yield greater benefits to population health while mitigating the strain on a heavily constrained health-care system.

"Female sex workers (FSW) experience a disproportionately high burden of HIV infection, yet characterization of the vaginal immune microenvironment that may impact biological risk is not well studied among FSW in the United States. Additionally, feasible methodology for collecting biological materials has not been evaluated in this population.
We enrolled 10 FSW (5 premenopausal, 5 postmenopausal) who participated in a survey and provided vaginal swabs. Biomarkers were assessed by ELISA, and included cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial/wound-healing mediators.
One hundred percent of FSW were African American, with a median age of 43.5. The median age when participants started sex work was 17.5, with 60% working 7 days per week and seeing up to 10 clients per night. Eighty percent reported recent unprotected sex and only 30% used some form of contraception. One self-reported sexually transmitted infection at the time of visit and two reported living with HIV. Vaginal secretions showed detectable levels of all biomarkers tested, except MIP3α and MIP1α, which were undetectable in all samples. When stratified by age/menopause status, no significant changes were observed except for Serpin A1 with higher median levels in premenopausal compared to postmenopausal FSW (median 5.79 vs. 5.205 log pg/mL, p = 0.016). Comparison with samples from an existing repository of non-FSW women showed significantly reduced chemokines IL8 (p = 0.045), MIP3α (p ≤ 0.001), and MIP1β (p = 0.015) in the FSW group.

"Uganda has a high burden of cervical cancer and its current coverage of screening based on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is low. High-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing is recommended by the World Health Organization as part of the global elimination strategy for cervical cancer. In this context, country-specific health economic evaluations can inform national-level decisions regarding implementation. We evaluated the recommended hrHPV screen-and-treat strategy to determine the minimum required levels of coverage and treatment adherence, as well as the maximum price level per test, for the strategy to be cost-effective in Uganda.
We conducted a headroom analysis to estimate potential room for spending on implementing the hrHPV screen-and-treat strategy at different levels of coverage and treatment adherence (from 10% to 100%) at each screening round, and at different price levels of the hrHPV test. We compared the strategy with the existing VIA-based screen-and-treat policy in Uganda. We calculated headroom as the product of number of life years gained by the strategy and the willingness-to-pay threshold, minus the incremental costs incurred by the strategy. Positive headroom was interpreted as an indication of cost-effectiveness.
Compared with VIA-based screening with low 5% coverage, the hrHPV screen-and-treat strategy required at least 30% coverage and adherence for positive mean headroom, and compared with 30% VIA-based screening coverage, the minimum levels were 60%. At 60% coverage and adherence, the maximum acceptable price per hrHPV test was found to be between 15 and 30 international dollars.
The hrHPV-based screen-and-treat strategy could be cost-effective in Uganda if the screening coverage and treatment adherence are at least 30% in each screening round, and if the price per test is set below 30 international dollars. The minimum required levels of screening coverage and adherence to treatment provide potential starting points for decision-makers in planning the rollout of hrHPV testing. The headroom estimates can guide the planning costs of screening infrastructure and campaigns to achieve the required coverage and treatment adherence in Uganda.","Compared with VIA-based screening with low 5% coverage, the hrHPV screen-and-treat strategy required at least 30% coverage and adherence for positive mean headroom, and compared with 30% VIA-based screening coverage, the minimum levels were 60%.

"Ensuring women's sexual and reproductive health (SRH) is a fundamental human right and key to 2030 agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), yet limited evidence exists on SRH in China, including national estimates and disparities of women's SRH experiences, gynaecological diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
A national cross-sectional survey based on a multistage stratified sampling from 15 provinces of China was performed from May 2019 to April 2021. A total of 12 815 reproductive-aged (20-49 years) women were involved. The SRH experiences (including age at menarche, age at first sexual activity, history of abortion, miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, age at first delivery, types of delivery), the history of gynaecological diseases and STDs, as well as the environmental factors of participants were investigated. Human development index (HDI) was utilised to categorise and describe the socioeconomic status of the regions. The prevalence rates of diseases were compared among different HDI regions.
We observed a decrease in the mean age at menarche, an increase in the proportion of women who became sexually active before 20, and a modest rise in mean age at first childbirth across generations. Age-standardised prevalence estimates of miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage, artificial abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth were 9.3, 1.4, 55.7, 3.3, and 2.1%, respectively. Approximately 50% of participants reported a history of gynaecological diseases, with vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic infection diseases being the most prevalent. The overall prevalence of STDs was estimated at 22.2‰, with mycoplasma genitalium infection having the highest reported prevalence. Disease prevalence varies across HDI regions.
Women's SRH behaviours and experiences have evolved, along with shifts in the spectrums of gynaecological diseases and STDs in China. Urgent recalibration of health care policies and disease control strategies is necessary, aligning them with women's changing SRH needs, ultimately ensuring their reproductive health and rights.","We observed a decrease in the mean age at menarche, an increase in the proportion of women who became sexually active before 20, and a modest rise in mean age at first childbirth across generations.

"BackgroundIn the Netherlands, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been available since 2019. However, the extent of PrEP use prior to HIV diagnosis and development of PrEP-resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) is not known.AimWe assessed prior PrEP use and potential transmission of PrEP RAMs among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons (TGP) with a new HIV diagnosis in the Netherlands.MethodsData on prior PrEP use between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2022 were available from the Dutch national ATHENA cohort. We assessed proportion of prior PrEP use, detected PrEP associated RAMs and assessed potential onward transmission of RAMs between 2010 and 2022 using a maximum likelihood tree.ResultsData on prior PrEP use were available for 583/1,552 (36.3%) individuals, with 16% (94/583) reporting prior PrEP use. In 489 individuals reporting no prior PrEP use, 51.5% did not use PrEP due to: low HIV-risk perception (29%), no access (19.1%), personal preference (13.1%), and being unaware of PrEP (19.1%). For PrEP users, 13/94 (13.8%) harboured a M184V/I mutation, of whom two also harboured a K65R mutation. In people with a recent HIV infection, detection of PrEP RAMs increased from 0.23% (2/862) before 2019 to 4.11% (9/219) from 2019. We found no evidence of onward transmission of PrEP RAMs.ConclusionThe prevalence of PrEP-associated RAMs has increased since PrEP became available in the Netherlands. More widespread access to PrEP and retaining people in PrEP programmes when still at substantial risk is crucial to preventing new HIV infections.",,"[{'lastname': 'Jongen', 'firstname': 'Vita W', 'initials': 'VW', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Public Health Service Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bezemer', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Sighem', 'firstname': 'Ard', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Boyd', 'firstname': 'Anders', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Public Health Service Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Rokx', 'firstname': 'Casper', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section Infectious Diseases, and Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Grintjes', 'firstname': 'Karin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Cents-Bosma', 'firstname': 'Aafke', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Flevoziekenhuis, Almere, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Op de Coul', 'firstname': 'Eline', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Benthem', 'firstname': 'Birgit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wensing', 'firstname': 'Annemarie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Translational Virology Research Group, Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wit', 'firstname': 'Ferdinand Wnm', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Valk', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Stichting HIV Monitoring, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nAmsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious Diseases, Amsterdam Infection & Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'The members of ATHENA national observational HIV cohort are acknowledged at the end of the article.'}]","Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis use and resistance-associated mutations among men who have sex with men and transgender persons newly diagnosed with HIV in the Netherlands: results from the ATHENA cohort, 2018 to 2022."
"Among many antiretroviral drugs, tenofovir alafenamide is used extensively in combination regimens of tenofovir/emtricitabine or tenofovir/emtricitabine/bictegravir. However, concerns have arisen about the potential of tenofovir alafenamide to exacerbate hyperlipidaemia. This meta-analysis evaluates the relationship between tenofovir alafenamide use and lipid-profile alterations in people living with HIV.
We searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify studies on changes in cholesterol levels (e.g. total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) in people living with HIV who received treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir alafenamide (data collected 31 March 2023, review completed 30 July 2023). Potential risk factors for worsening lipid profile during treatment with tenofovir alafenamide were also evaluated.
Sixty-five studies involving 39,713 people living with HIV were selected. Significant increases in total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed after treatment with tenofovir alafenamide. Specifically, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+12.31 mg/dl) and total cholesterol (+18.86 mg/dl) increased markedly from the third month of tenofovir alafenamide use, with significant elevations observed across all time points up to 36 months. Comparatively, tenofovir alafenamide regimens resulted in higher lipid levels than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimens at 12 months of use. Notably, discontinuation of the tenofovir alafenamide regimen led to significant decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-9.31 mg/dl) and total cholesterol (-8.91 mg/dl). Additionally, tenofovir alafenamide use was associated with increased bodyweight (+1.38 kg; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.84), which became more pronounced over time. Meta-regression analysis identified young age, male sex and low body mass index as risk factors for worsening cholesterol levels in individuals treated with tenofovir alafenamide.

Understanding temporal changes in HIV incidence among KP is critical yet, due to logistical constraints, there are few sources of longitudinal incidence data, particularly among KP.
We present HIV incidence rates from June 2014 to December 2022 among cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) attending community-based integrated care centres (ICCs) in 15 Indian cities. ICCs, established between 2014 and 2017, provide HIV testing and other services to MSM (eight sites) or PWID (eight sites). Client HIV testing data were included in the analysis if they had ≥2 tests and were not positive on the first test. We calculated incidence rates per 100 person-years (PY), stratified by KP, city/site and year. Poisson regression explored associations of incidence with time, age, gender (PWID only) and ICC use.
From June 2014 to December 2022, 13,501 clients (5722 MSM, 7779 PWID) had ≥2 HIV tests over a median of 1.8 years. There were a total of 1093 incident HIV acquisitions. Overall incidence rates for MSM and PWID were 1.9/100 PY (95% CI: 1.7-2.2) and 4.1 (3.9-4.4), respectively. Among MSM sites, incidence ranged from 0.4 to 3.5 and in PWID sites from 0.6 to 17.9. From adjusted models, incidence increased by 17% annually among MSM. Among PWID, incidence increased by 11% annually up until 2020 and then decreased by 29% after 2020; when excluding the outlier of New Delhi, incidence was stable among PWID. MSM and PWID 21-25 years old had the highest risk of HIV and among PWID, those more consistently engaged in medication for opioid use disorder were at the lowest risk.
While there was substantial geographic variability, MSM and PWID engaged in a free community-based clinic experienced persistently high HIV incidence (>2/100 PY). KP in low- and middle-income countries should be a focus when considering novel strategies such as long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis to curtail incidence.","From June 2014 to December 2022, 13,501 clients (5722 MSM, 7779 PWID) had ≥2 HIV tests over a median of 1.8 years.

"Perinatal depression affects one-third of pregnant women living with HIV (WLH). We examined patterns of treatment response to a novel stepped model of depression care among WLH with perinatal depression in Uganda.
As part of the Maternal Depression Treatment in HIV (M-DEPTH) cluster randomised controlled trial, 191 women were enrolled across four antenatal care clinics assigned to provide stepped care including behavioural and antidepressant therapy (ADT), and another 200 across four clinics assigned to provide usual care. They were assessed for depression severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at enrolment and multiple times over 12 months of follow-up. We used repeated measures latent class analysis (LCA) to identify discrete trajectories of depression symptoms, while multinomial regression analyses measured correlates of class membership.
The LCA identified three trajectories among those in the treatment group: mildly depressed individuals who improved (MiD-I) (n = 143, 75%), moderately depressed individuals who improved (MoD-I) (n = 33, 17%), and moderately depressed individuals who remained depressed (MoD-R) (n = 15, 8%). Membership in MiD-I was associated with lower levels of intimate partner violence at baseline (P = 0.04) and month 6 (P < 0.001), and less recent trauma exposure (P = 0.03) at baseline. At month 6, social support was lowest in MoD-R, while the degree of negative problem-solving orientation was highest (both P < 0.001) in this class. The LCA also identified three trajectories among those in the usual care comparison group: mildly depressed (MiD) (n = 62, 31%), moderately depressed (MoD) (n = 71, 35%), and seriously depressed (SiD) (n = 67, 34%), with each experiencing slight improvement. Recent traumas at baseline were highest in SiD (P < 0.001); this group also reported the lowest positive problem-solving orientation and highest negative problem-solving orientation (P < 0.001) at baseline.
Depression symptom trajectories among women with perinatal depression are related to modifiable factors such as problem-solving orientation and interpersonal dynamics, with the latter including intimate partner violence and social support. Most treatment recipients were characterised by trajectories indicating recovery from depression.

"Dyslipidemia is increasingly common in people living with HIV (PLHIV), thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events and diminishing the quality of life for these individuals. The study of blood lipid metabolism of PLHIV has great clinical significance in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, this study aims to examine the blood lipid metabolism status of HIV-infected patients in Huzhou before and after receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and to explore the impact of different HAART regimens on dyslipidemia.
PLHIV confirmed in Huzhou from June 2010 to June 2022 was included. The baseline characteristics and clinical data during the follow-up period were collected, including some blood lipid indicators (total cholesterol and triglycerides) and HAART regimens. A multivariate logistic regression model and the generalized estimating equation model were used to analyze the independent effects of treatment regimens on the risk of dyslipidemia.
The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia among PLHIV after HAART was 70.11%. PLHIV receiving lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz (EFV) + zidovudine (AZT) had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia compared to those receiving 3TC+EFV+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). In a logistic analysis adjusted for important covariates such as BMI, age, diabetes status, etc., we found that the risks of dyslipidemia were higher with 3TC+EFV+AZT (dyslipidemia: odds ratio [OR] = 2.09, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.28-3.41; TG ≥1.7: OR = 2.40, 95%Cl:1.50-3.84) than with 3TC+EFV+TDF. Furthermore, on PLHIV that was matched 1:1 by the HAART regimens, the results of the generalized estimation equation again showed that 3TC+EFV+AZT (TG ≥1.7: OR = 1.84, 95%Cl: 1.10-3.07) is higher for the risk of marginal elevations of TG than 3TC+EFV+TDF.
The prevalence of dyslipidemia varies according to different antiretroviral regimens. Using both horizontal and longitudinal data, we have repeatedly demonstrated that AZT has a more adverse effect on blood lipids than TDF from two perspectives. Therefore, we recommend caution in using the 3TC+EFV+AZT regimen for people at clinical risk of co-occurring cardiovascular disease.",,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yanan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nDivision of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nCenter on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Zhongrong', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Zhenqian', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Xiaoqi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nCenter on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yuxin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nCenter on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Ziyi', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nCenter on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Zhaowei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Huzhou Central Hospital, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiaofeng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Huzhou Central Hospital, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ren', 'firstname': 'Feilin', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Meihua', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Huzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mao', 'firstname': 'Guangyun', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nCenter on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.'}]",The risk of dyslipidemia on PLHIV associated with different antiretroviral regimens in Huzhou.
"Dolutegravir has been used as a first-line anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug because of its better efficacy compared with other counterpart medicines. However, making a unanimous decision on its use during pregnancy has become difficult for stakeholders following congenital anomalies reported with its use. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to study the risk of congenital anomalies in newborns exposed to dolutegravir-based-regimens compared with those exposed to non-dolutegravir-based regimens during the antenatal period.
An extensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov until 30 November, 2023. Studies reporting data on congenital anomalies following antenatal use of dolutegravir were included.

"The era of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly improved health and survival among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PWH). In the pre-ART era, wasting was associated with HIV disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and death. Effective ART has reduced the prevalence and incidence of this pre-ART form of HIV-associated wasting. However, a subgroup of ART-treated virally suppressed PWH continue to lose weight, often accompanied by aging-related comorbidities and/or functional deficits. For this subgroup of patients, the older definition of HIV-associated wasting (HIVAW) cannot and should not be applied. An expert panel comprising the authors of this white paper convened to review the existing definition of HIVAW and to create an updated definition that they termed HIV-associated weight loss, based on clinically defined parameters among contemporary PWH receiving ART. Here, clinical features and laboratory biomarkers associated with HIV-associated weight loss are reviewed and approaches to screening and treatment are considered. Available management approaches, including the use of current US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for HIVAW and other available therapies are discussed.

"Cervical cancer is a significant global health challenge, with the majority of cases and deaths occurring in low-resource regions like sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) in this area face a six-fold higher risk of cervical cancer compared to women living without HIV Both the availability of screening services and their utilization remain low, particularly among WLHIV, hindering efforts to reduce the cervical cancer burden in this vulnerable population.
This study aimed to synthesize the current research on the prevalence of cervical cancer screening utilization and the associated factors among women living with HIV in Ethiopia.
We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, searching databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published from 2015 up to 2023 and the search period for these relevant articles was from April 1 up to April 30, 2024. Data from included studies was extracted, organized in Excel, and then analyzed using STATA 17. The overall effect across all studies was calculated using a random-effect model. Potential publication bias and heterogeneity in the results between studies were assessed using Egger's test, forest plot, and I² statistic, respectively.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of cervical cancer screening utilization among women living with HIV in Ethiopia was 24% (17 - 32%). Several factors were independently associated with cervical cancer screening utilization, including age (40-49) years (OR = 3.95, 95% CI: 3.307-4.595), age (18-29) years (OR = 5.021, 95% CI: 1.563-9.479), education level greater than college (OR = 3.293, 95% CI: 1.835-4.751), having good knowledge (OR = 3.421, 95% CI: 2.928-3.915), early initiation of sexual intercourse (OR = 3.421, 95% CI: 2.928-3.915), awareness of cervical cancer (OR = 3.551, 95% CI: 2.945-4.157), having information about cancer (OR = 3.671, 95% CI: 2.606-4.736), CD4 count less than 500 cell/mm3 (OR = 4.001, 95% CI: 1.463-6.539), government employee (OR = 5.921, 95% CI: 1.767-10.076), and perceived susceptibility (OR = 2.950, 95% CI: 2.405-3.496).
This systematic review and meta-analysis show that the pooled prevalence of cervical cancer screening rates among Women living with HIV in Ethiopia is notably low, at only 24%. Factors influencing service utilization include age, education level, knowledge about cervical cancer, early sexual initiation, awareness of the disease itself, and HIV-related conditions.

"Including structural determinants (e.g. criminalisation, stigma, inequitable gender norms) in dynamic HIV transmission models is important to help quantify their population-level impacts and guide implementation of effective interventions that reduce the burden of HIV and inequalities thereof. However, evidence-based modelling of structural determinants is challenging partly due to a limited understanding of their causal pathways and few empirical estimates of their effects on HIV acquisition and transmission.
We conducted a scoping review of dynamic HIV transmission modelling studies that evaluated the impacts of structural determinants, published up to August 28, 2023, using Ovid Embase and Medline online databases. We appraised studies on how models represented exposure to structural determinants and causal pathways. Building on this, we developed a new methodological framework and recommendations to support the incorporation of structural determinants in transmission dynamics models and their analyses. We discuss the data and analyses that could strengthen the evidence used to inform these models.
We identified 17 HIV modelling studies that represented structural determinants and/or interventions, including incarceration of people who inject drugs (number of studies [n] = 5), violence against women (n = 3), HIV stigma (n = 1), and housing instability (n = 1), among others (n = 7). Most studies (n = 10) modelled exposures dynamically. Almost half (8/17 studies) represented multiple exposure histories (e.g. current, recent, non-recent exposure). Structural determinants were often assumed to influence HIV indirectly by influencing mediators such as contact patterns, condom use, and antiretroviral therapy use. However, causal pathways' assumptions were sometimes simple, with few mediators explicitly represented in the model, and largely based on cross-sectional associations. Although most studies calibrated models using HIV epidemiological data, less than half (7/17) also fitted or cross-validated to data on the prevalence, frequency, or effects of exposure to structural determinants.
Mathematical models can play a crucial role in elucidating the population-level impacts of structural determinants and interventions on HIV. We recommend the next generation of models reflect exposure to structural determinants dynamically and mechanistically, and reproduce the key causal pathways, based on longitudinal evidence of links between structural determinants, mediators, and HIV. This would improve the validity and usefulness of predictions of the impacts of structural determinants and interventions.","We identified 17 HIV modelling studies that represented structural determinants and/or interventions, including incarceration of people who inject drugs (number of studies [n] = 5), violence against women (n = 3), HIV stigma (n = 1), and housing instability (n = 1), among others (n = 7).

Although most studies calibrated models using HIV epidemiological data, less than half (7/17) also fitted or cross-validated to data on the prevalence, frequency, or effects of exposure to structural determinants.","[{'lastname': 'Stannah', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population and Global Health, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Flores Anato', 'firstname': 'Jorge Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population and Global Health, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pickles', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.\nHPTN Modelling Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Larmarange', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre Population et Développement, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Université Paris Cité, Inserm, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mitchell', 'firstname': 'Kate M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.\nDepartment of Nursing and Community Health, Glasgow Caledonian University, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Artenie', 'firstname': 'Adelina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dumchev', 'firstname': 'Kostyantyn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Ukrainian Institute On Public Health Policy, Kiev, Ukraine.'}, {'lastname': 'Niangoran', 'firstname': 'Serge', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Programme PAC-CI, CHU de Treichville, Site ANRS, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.""}, {'lastname': 'Platt', 'firstname': 'Lucy', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Terris-Prestholt', 'firstname': 'Fern', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'UNAIDS, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Aditya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Stone', 'firstname': 'Jack', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Vickerman', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Phillips', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Leigh', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Maheu-Giroux', 'firstname': 'Mathieu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Population and Global Health, McGill University, Montréal, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Boily', 'firstname': 'Marie-Claude', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK. mc.boily@imperial.ac.uk.\nHPTN Modelling Centre, Imperial College London, London, UK. mc.boily@imperial.ac.uk.'}]",From conceptualising to modelling structural determinants and interventions in HIV transmission dynamics models: a scoping review and methodological framework for evidence-based analyses.
"Europe has been at the forefront of harm reduction since its inception. These important early steps were in large part a response to the dramatically expanding HIV epidemic, and investing in these innovative interventions early and robustly had a transformative effect. This brought about not just pioneering services but also pioneering policy changes. However, while Western Europe and Member States in the European Union often have been at the vanguard of harm reduction innovation and vocal advocates for public health and human rights-based drug policy reform, the situation has been much different in the ""wider"" WHO European region, which also includes Eastern and Southeastern Europe as well as Central Asia. This is a result not just of limited budgets for health, but also of punitive laws and policies and persistent stigma and discrimination. Even as harm reduction has demonstrated huge successes in Europe, there is a need to move forward a wider array of services to respond to an evolving and increasingly complex drug situation in Europe. Instead, it is a lack of political will and of political courage that is holding back the establishment, expansion, and deepening of these essential, lifesaving interventions.

"Mother-to-child transmission of HIV during breastfeeding remains a challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). A prevention package was initiated during the highly attended 2nd visit of the Expanded Program of Immunisation (EPI-2) to identify the undiagnosed infants living with HIV and reduce the postnatal transmission of infant exposed to HIV.
PREVENIR-PEV is a non-randomized phase II clinical trial conducted at two health centres in Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). The study recruited mothers living with HIV aged 15 years and older with their singleton breastfed infants. During EPI-2 (at 8 weeks) and upon signature of the informed consent, a point-of-care early infant diagnosis (EID) was performed. HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infants were followed-up until 12 months of age. High risk HEU infants (i.e., whose maternal viral load ≥ 1000 cp/mL at EPI-2 or M6) received an extended postnatal prophylaxis (PNP) with lamivudine until end of follow-up or the end of breastfeeding.
Between 4 December 2019 and 4 December 2020, 118 mothers living with HIV-1 were identified, and 102 eligible mother/infant pairs had their infants tested for HIV EID. Six infants were newly diagnosed with HIV, and 96 HEU infants were followed-up for 10 months. Among the participants followed-up, all mothers were prescribed antiretrovirals. All 18 infants eligible for PNP at either EPI-2 or 6 months (M6) were initiated on lamivudine. No HIV transmission occurred, and no serious adverse events were reported in infants receiving lamivudine.
The PREVENIR-PEV prevention package integrated into existing care is safe and its implementation is feasible in a LMIC with a low HIV prevalence. More research is needed to target mother/infant pairs not adhering to the intervention proposed in this trial.

"A persisting high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is causal for cervical cancer; however, there is limited population-based data on the prevalence of HPV infections in Germany. We assessed the age and type-specific HPV prevalence, and associated risk factors in HPV unvaccinated women aged 30 and above.
The MARZY prospective population-based cohort study was conducted between 2005 and 2012 in Mainz and Mainz-Bingen, Germany. Eligible women were randomly recruited from population registries and invited for cervical cancer screening (n = 5,275). A study swab (liquid-based cytology) was taken and HPV testing was performed with GP5+/6 + polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by genotyping. We assessed HPV types as HR-HPV, 'moderate' risk and low-risk (LR-HPV). Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with HPV infection, stratified by HPV types.
2,520 women were screened with a valid PCR result. Overall HPV prevalence was 10.6% (n = 266), with 6.5% HR-HPV positive (n = 165), 1.5% 'moderate' risk type (n = 38) and 3.3% LR-HPV type (n = 84) positive. 8.9% had a single infection (n = 225) and 1.6% had multiple types (n = 41). The most common HR-HPV types were 16, 56, 52 and 31 and LR-HPV 90 and 42. Of 187 HR-HPV infections detected (among 165 women), 55.1% (n = 103) were with HPV types not covered by available bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccines. About 23% (n = 43) were of types not covered by the nonavalent vaccine (HPV 35, 39, 51, 56, 59). The HR and LR-HPV prevalence were highest in the age group 30-34 years (HR 9.8%, 'moderate' risk 3.0% and LR 5.6%), decreasing with increasing age. HR-HPV prevalence in women with normal cytology was 5.5%. In women with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), prevalence was 66.7%. Women currently not living with a partner and current smokers had increased chances of an HR-HPV infection.
The overall population-based HPV prevalence was relatively high. An important share of prevalent HR-HPV infections constituted types not covered by current HPV vaccines. With the advent of HPV screening and younger vaccinated cohorts joining screening, HPV types should be monitored closely, also in older women who were not eligible for HPV vaccination.","2,520 women were screened with a valid PCR result.

"While HIV testing and counselling play a crucial role in preventing mother-to-child transmission, numerous pregnant women did not receive these services. Understanding the spatial variation of HIV testing and counselling and its associated factors during antenatal care in Ethiopia remains limited. Thus, this study was aimed at assessing the spatial patterns and factors associated with HIV testing and counselling during antenatal care visits in Ethiopia.
A cross-sectional study design was employed with a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. A total of 2,789 women who gave birth in the two years prior to the survey and had at least one antenatal care visit were included in the study. Stata version 16 and ArcGIS version 10.8 software were used for analysis. A multilevel robust Poisson regression model was fitted to identify significantly associated factors since the prevalence of HIV testing and counselling was higher than 10%. A statistically significant association was declared based on multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis using an adjusted prevalence ratio with its 95% confidence interval at a p-value < 0.05. Spatial regression analysis was conducted, and the local coefficients of statistically significant spatial covariates were visualised.
In Ethiopia, the overall prevalence of HIV testing and counselling during antenatal care visits was 29.5% (95% CI: 27.8%, 31.2%). Significant spatial clustering was observed (Global Moran's I = 0.138, p-value <0.001). In the spatial regression analysis, high and comprehensive knowledge related to HIV, and comprehensive knowledge on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission were significant explanatory variables for the spatial variation of HIV testing and counselling. In the multivariable multilevel robust Poisson regression analysis, education, household wealth, media exposure, number of antenatal care visits, comprehensive knowledge on mother-to-child transmission, comprehensive knowledge on prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and region were significantly associated factors.

"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and antibacterial resistance (ABR) are important public health problems, but they are not well-studied among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) globally, especially in low-income countries. Therefore, it is important to regularly measure the extent of UTIs and ABR in the most susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of UTIs, associated factors, bacterial causal agents, and their antibiotic susceptibility profile among PLHIV in central Ethiopia.
A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 688 PLHIV by a simple random sampling method. Background information was gathered through interviews, while clinical information was gathered from recent information sheets of patient charts using organized, pretested, and validated study tools. Midstream urine was collected aseptically and transported to the Microbiology Laboratory of Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology within 4 h of collection, maintaining its cold chain. Standard conventional microbial culture methods and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry were used to identify the bacterial isolates at the species level. Kirby Bauer's disk diffusion method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacterial isolates based on the interpretation guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute. Logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with the occurrence of UTIs among PLHIV attending selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, and Adama.
Out of 688 PLHIVs involved in the current study, 144 (20.9%) were positive for UTIs, whereas the majority were asymptomatic for UTIs. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, only HIV RNA ≥ 200 copies/ml [AOR = 12.24 (95% CI, 3.24, 46.20),

"Monkeypox (Mpox), an uncommon zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, is commonly manifested by blisters on the skin and has a mortality rate of approximately 0-10%. Approximately two decades after the cessation of global smallpox vaccination, the number of confirmed cases of Mpox has been growing, making it the most common Orthopoxvirus infection. Therefore, in this narrative review, we aimed to shed light on recent advancements in the pathophysiology, transmission routes, epidemiology, manifestations, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Mpox, as well as the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for predicting this disease. The clinical manifestations of Mpox, including the onset of symptoms and dermatologic characteristics, are similar to those of the infamous smallpox, but Mpox is clinically milder. Notably, a key difference between smallpox and Mpox is the high prevalence of lymphadenopathy. Human-to-human, animal-to-human, and animal-to-animal transmission are the three main pathways of Mpox spread that must be considered for effective prevention, particularly during outbreaks. PCR testing, as the preferred method for diagnosing Mpox infection, can enhance early detection of new cases and thereby improve infection control measures. JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 are among the vaccines most commonly recommended for the prevention of Mpox. Brincidofovir, Cidofovir, and Tecovirimat are the primary treatments for Mpox cases. Similar to other viral infections, the best approach to managing Mpox is prevention. This can, in part, be achieved through measures such as reducing contact with individuals displaying symptoms, maintaining personal safety, and adhering to practices commonly used to prevent sexually transmitted infections.",,"[{'lastname': 'Rahmani', 'firstname': 'Erfan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Bayat', 'firstname': 'Ziba', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Farrokhi', 'firstname': 'Mehrdad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Student Research Committee, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Karimian', 'firstname': 'Shiva', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Zahedpasha', 'firstname': 'Reza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, 5th Azar Hospital, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Sabzehie', 'firstname': 'Hamed', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Kocaeli Health and Technology University, Kocaeli, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramezani Poor', 'firstname': 'Sepehr', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Jafari Khouzani', 'firstname': 'Parisa', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Graduated, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Aminpour', 'firstname': 'Solmaz', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Karami', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Student, Nanjing Medical University, International School (SIE), Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Afsharjahanshahi', 'firstname': 'Omid', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Atilim University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharifi', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'City Dental College and Hospital, Dhaka University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Dalvandi', 'firstname': 'Behnaz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Dalvandi', 'firstname': 'Reza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Esfahani', 'firstname': 'Amirhossein', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Alaei', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirbolouk', 'firstname': 'Mahtab', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Cyprus International University, Nicosia, North Cyprus .'}, {'lastname': 'Moradi', 'firstname': 'Fateme', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Nozari', 'firstname': 'Amitis', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirabedini', 'firstname': 'Seyed Mohammad Shahab', 'initials': 'SMS', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Janmohamadi', 'firstname': 'Mahrokh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Moghimi', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology,\xa0Tulane School of Medicine,\xa0Tulane\xa0University, New Orleans 70112, Louisiana, U.S.A.'}, {'lastname': 'Nikfarjam', 'firstname': 'Farzaneh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Jalayer Sarnaghy', 'firstname': 'Faezeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirbolook', 'firstname': 'Amirhossein', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pirouzan', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohammadi Virsoudi', 'firstname': 'Mozhdeh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Moghadam Fard', 'firstname': 'Atousa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Nikandishnobar', 'firstname': 'Mehdi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Atilim University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Boustani Hezarani', 'firstname': 'Hossein', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Azerbaijan Medical University, Baku, Azerbaijan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fadavighafari', 'firstname': 'Mohammadreza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Farrokhi', 'firstname': 'Masoud', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'ERIS Research Institute, Tehran, Iran.'}]","Monkeypox: A Comprehensive Review of Virology, Epidemiology, Transmission, Diagnosis, Prevention, Treatment, and Artificial Intelligence Applications."
"The study sought to systematically compare the expression of molecular markers in benign cutaneous lesions and squamous cell cervical carcinoma associated with HPV infection to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in HPV-related lesions and their progression to malignancy. We included 200 patients recruited from a gynecological clinic divided into two groups: 100 patients with positive HPV tests presenting with cutaneous lesions and 100 patients diagnosed with squamous cell cervical carcinoma and testing positive for HPV. The participants were selected to ensure diverse ethnic and demographic representation. The study utilized different statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests to assess associations between categorical variables and logistic regression to evaluate factors influencing lesion progression and compare marker expressions across different lesion types. The results indicated significant differences in the expression of specific molecular markers between cutaneous lesions and cervical carcinomas, highlighting distinct molecular pathways involved in HPV-related lesion development. Notably, markers such as p16, p53, and E-cadherin showed varying expression, suggesting their potential role in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions. The findings emphasize the significance of molecular marker profiling in improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HPV-related lesions. The differential expression of molecular markers can offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HPV-induced lesions and help develop targeted interventions to prevent malignant transformation.

"The cGAS-STING signaling pathway plays a critical role in innate immunity and defense against viral infections by orchestrating intracellular and adaptive immune responses to DNA. In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), this pathway has garnered significant attention due to its potential relevance in disease development and progression. HNSCC is strongly associated with risk factors such as smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The presence or absence of HPV in HNSCC patients has been shown to have a profound impact on patient survival and prognosis, possibly due to the distinct biological characteristics of HPV-associated tumors. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current therapeutic approaches and challenges in HNSCC management, as well as the involvement of cGAS-STING signaling and its potential in the therapy of HNSCC. In addition, by advancing the present understanding of the mechanisms underlying this pathway, Activation of cGAS-STING-dependent inflammatory signaling downstream of chromosomal instability can exert both anti-tumoral and pro-tumoral effects in a cell-intrinsic manner, suggesting individualized therapy is of great importance.

"People living with HIV have high rates of hypertension. Integrated HIV and hypertension care with aligned multi-month dispensing of medications (MMD) could decrease the burden of care for individuals and health systems. We sought to describe hypertension control and evaluate its association with different durations of MMD among Malawian adults receiving integrated care with aligned dispensing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and antihypertensive medication.
We conducted a cross-sectional survey and retrospective chart review of adults (≥18 years) receiving integrated HIV and hypertension care on medications for both conditions for at least 1 year, with aligned MMD at seven clinics in Malawi. Data were collected from July 2021 to April 2022 and included socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, antihypertensive medications and up to the three most recent blood pressure measurements. Bivariate analyses were used to characterize associations with hypertension control. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as ≥2 measurements ≥140 and/or ≥90 mmHg. Chart reviews were conducted for a random subset of participants with uncontrolled hypertension to describe antihypertensive medication adjustments in the prior year.
We surveyed 459 adults receiving integrated care with aligned dispensing (58% female; median age 54 years). Individuals most commonly received a 3-month aligned dispensing of ART and antihypertensive medications (63%), followed by every 6 months (16%) and every 4 months (15%). Hypertension control was assessed in 359 respondents, of whom only 23% had controlled hypertension; 90% of individuals in this group reported high adherence to blood pressure medications (0-1 missed days/week).

"Courier delivery has become a popular antiretroviral therapy (ART) distribution method in some HIV care settings, yet data on ART courier delivery and how it relates to ART outcomes are scarce. We studied the differences in viral suppression rates between individuals from a South African private sector HIV programme receiving ART by courier delivery and those receiving ART through traditional retail dispensing.
Individuals aged 15 years or older who were actively enrolled in the Aid for AIDS programme between January 2011 and July 2022 were eligible for the analysis. The outcome of interest was viral suppression defined as a viral load (VL) <400 copies per ml. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the association between the ART distribution method and viral suppression, comparing those receiving refills through courier pharmacies versus retail dispensing at the time of the VL testing. We used generalized estimating equations to account for repeated VL testing of the same individual. The models were adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, ART regimen, history of mental illness and medical insurance scheme. We computed adjusted ORs for the calendar periods 2011-2013, 2014-2016, 2017-2019, 2020-2022 and overall.
We extracted 442,619 VL measurements from 68,720 eligible individuals, 39,406 (57.3%) were women. The median number of VL measurements per individual was 6 (IQR 3-10). VL suppression was detected in 398,901 (90.1%) tests, and 185,701 (42.0%) of the tests were taken while the individual was receiving ART by courier delivery. Overall, courier delivery was associated with 5% higher odds of viral suppression than retail dispensing (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08). The strength and direction of this association varied by calendar period, with an adjusted OR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.27-1.48) in 2011-2013 and 1.02 (95% CI 0.97-1.07) in 2020-2022.

"Cervical cancer is a preventable disease that continues to burden socioeconomically underserved regions, especially in Africa. Vaccination of adolescents who have never had sex with prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines proves effective in preventing the disease. However, vaccine accessibility and availability are two persistent challenges in low-resource settings. For this commentary, a trend analysis is conducted for national HPV vaccination and coverage rates in Africa, a region with high burden of the disease. This is in consideration of the World Health Organization (WHO) strategy to vaccinate 90% of adolescent girls by the age of 15, as part of strategy to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030. The analysis estimated that the rate of incorporating HPV vaccination in national immunization programs in Africa occurs slowly, at a mean wait time of 12 years with estimated coverage rate of 52%. A policy change that harnesses strategic approaches, such as a regionalized vaccination program, is recommended to hasten HPV vaccination for the rest of African countries without a national program.",,"[{'lastname': 'Asempah', 'firstname': 'Eric', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, Canada. easempah@yorku.ca.'}, {'lastname': 'Ikpebe', 'firstname': 'Ene', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Askew School of Administration and Policy, South Florida University, 113 Collegiate Loop, Tallahassee, FL, 32306, USA.'}]",Accelerating HPV vaccination in Africa for health equity.
"This study explores socioecological factors facilitating the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) experiences of migrant and refugee youth (MRY) in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. MRY may be at higher risk for poorer SRH outcomes due to cultural, linguistic, and systemic barriers.
Using participatory action research, 17 focus groups were conducted with 87 MRY aged 15-29 from diverse cultural backgrounds. Data were analysed thematically, using socioecological framework.
Key facilitators of MRY's SRHR were identified at the microsystem and exosystem levels, including (1) Peer dynamics and support, with friends serving as trusted confidants and sources of advice; (2) Safety and contraceptive choices, highlighting the importance of access to contraception and STI prevention; and (3) Digital platforms for SRHR information access, with online resources filling knowledge gaps.
Findings suggest the need for SRHR interventions to leverage peer support networks, expand access to contraceptive options, and develop culturally appropriate digital resources for MRY. Further research is needed to identify and enhance facilitators across all socioecological levels to comprehensively support MRY's SRHR needs.
Migrants and refugee youth often struggle to access sexual and reproductive health information and services in their new countries. This study is an attempt to understand what helps young migrants and refugee maintain their sexual and reproductive health and rights in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. Our aim was to identify the positive factors in their environment that make it easier for them to access and use sexual health resources. We talked to 87 migrants and refugee youth aged 15–29 from various cultural backgrounds, conducting 17 group discussions about their experiences with sexual health. Our main results show three important factors that help these young people. The results were, that (1) Many young people trust their friends for advice and information about sexual health, (2) Having choices about contraception and ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections was important, and (3) The internet, especially social media and search engines, is a major source of sexual health information for young people. Understanding these helpful factors can guide better support for young migrants and refugees. It shows sexual health programs need to use peer support in sexual health programs, make sure young people can easily access contraception and protection and create trustworthy online resources about sexual health that are culturally appropriate. Our findings show more research is needed to find other ways to support young migrants and refugees with their sexual and reproductive health. This will help create better health services and education programs for these young people.","Key facilitators of MRY's SRHR were identified at the microsystem and exosystem levels, including (1) Peer dynamics and support, with friends serving as trusted confidants and sources of advice; (2) Safety and contraceptive choices, highlighting the importance of access to contraception and STI prevention; and (3) Digital platforms for SRHR information access, with online resources filling knowledge gaps.","[{'lastname': 'Aibangbee', 'firstname': 'Michaels', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia. 19877828@student.westernsydney.edu.au.\nSchool of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia. 19877828@student.westernsydney.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Micheal', 'firstname': 'Sowbhagya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Western Sydney University, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia.\nTranslational Health Research Institute & Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism Translational Research Unit, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Liamputtong', 'firstname': 'Pranee', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'College of Health Sciences, VinUniversity, Hanoi, Vietnam.'}, {'lastname': 'Pithavadian', 'firstname': 'Rashmi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hossain', 'firstname': 'Syeda Zakia', 'initials': 'SZ', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mpofu', 'firstname': 'Elias', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'University of North Texas, Denton, USA.\nUniversity of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nUniversity of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nWestern Sydney University, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dune', 'firstname': 'Tinashe', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Translational Health Research Institute & Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism Translational Research Unit, Western Sydney University, Penrith, NSW, Australia.'}]",Socioecologies in shaping migrants and refugee youths' sexual and reproductive health and rights: a participatory action research study.
"Among people living with HIV(PHIV) with unsuppressed viral load after six or more months of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), three intensive adherence counseling sessions (IAC) sessions are recommended. However, there is limited information about IAC completion rates. We investigated the factors associated with IAC completion among PLHIV with an unsuppressed viral load on first and second-line ART in mid-western Uganda.
In this retrospective review of medical records, we abstracted routine HIV data between January 2018 and September 2019 at the Fort Portal Regional Hospital. IAC completion was the primary outcome measured as the receipt of ≥ 3 consecutive good ART adherence scores of ≥ 95.0% during the IAC sessions, spaced one month apart within three months. The modified Poisson regression analysis with robust standard errors was used to determine factors associated with the outcome, reported as risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
We studied 420 participants of whom 204 (48.6%) were aged 20-39 years (mean age, 33.6 ± 13.3 years) and 243 (57.9%) were female. 282 (67.1%) participants completed their IAC sessions. Secondary or higher levels of education (Adjusted RR (aRR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.98), no follow-up for IAC (aRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.87), malnutrition (aRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) were associated with a lower likelihood of IAC completion while being in a separated/widowed or divorced relationship (aRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.49) was associated with a higher likelihood of IAC completion.
We found a low IAC completion rate compared to the desired target of 100%. Nutritional support for malnourished PLHIV receiving IAC, follow-ups, and targeted health education on the importance of IAC are needed to improve the IAC completion rate.","We studied 420 participants of whom 204 (48.6%) were aged 20-39 years (mean age, 33.6 ± 13.3 years) and 243 (57.9%) were female. 282 (67.1%) participants completed their IAC sessions.

"The assessment of p16INK4a (p16) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been incorporated into tumor classification, as p16 has been shown to impact survival probability. However, a recent study demonstrated that human papillomavirus (HPV) status in addition to p16 may have a better discriminatory effect on survival probability. This study aims to determine the impact of combined evaluation of p16 and HPV on prognosis.
This was a multicenter, multinational analysis including retrospective and prospective cohorts of patients treated for primary OPSCC with curative intent, based on the data of the HNCIG-EPIC study. The primary outcome was to determine how the combined assessment of HPV and p16 status predicts prognosis of patients with OPSCC compared to p16 assessment alone. We employed multivariable analyses models to compute hazard ratios regarding survival. Analyses were stratified by stage, smoking status, and sub-anatomical region.
The study included 7654 patients, with approximately half of the tumors being p16-negative (50.3 %, n = 3849). A total of 9.2 % of patients had discordant p16 and HPV status (n = 704). HPV status significantly impacted overall survival and disease-free survival regardless of p16 status and across both UICC 8th stage I-II and III-IVb cancers. p16-positive/HPV-positive OPSCC patients exhibited the best survival probability.
The detection of HPV had a significant impact on survival probability for OPSCC patients with both p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. HPV testing should be integrated in cancer staging, especially in regions of low attributable fraction, alongside p16 evaluation to ensure a comprehensive assessment of prognosis.","The study included 7654 patients, with approximately half of the tumors being p16-negative (50.3 %, n = 3849).

"Even during extended periods of effective immunological control, a substantial dynamic of the viral genome can be observed in different cellular compartments in HIV-1 positive individuals, indicating the persistence of active viral reservoirs. To obtain further insights, we studied changes in the proviral as well as in the viral HIV-1 envelope (Env) sequence along with transcriptional, translational and viral outgrowth activity as indicators for viral dynamics and genomic intactness. Our study identified distinct reservoir patterns that either represented highly sequence-diverse HIV-1 populations or only a single / few persisting virus variants. The single dominating variants were more often found in individuals starting ART during early infection phases, indicating that early treatment might limit reservoir diversification. At the same time, more sequence-diverse HIV reservoirs correlated with a poorer immune status, indicated by lower CD4 count, a higher number of regimen changes and more co-morbidities. Furthermore, we noted that in T-cell populations in the peripheral blood, replication-competent HIV-1 is predominantly present in Lymph node homing TN (naïve) and TCM (central memory) T cells. Provirus genomes archived in TTM (transitional memory) and TEM (effector memory) T cells more frequently tended to carry inactivating mutations and, population-wise, possess changes in the genetic diversity. These discriminating properties of the viral reservoir in T-cell subsets may have important implications for new early therapy strategies, underscoring the critical role of early therapy in preserving robust immune surveillance and constraining the viral reservoir.",,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yuepeng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Virology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Otte', 'firstname': 'Fabian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Virology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Stoeckle', 'firstname': 'Marcel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Infectiology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Thielen', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Seq-IT GmbH & Co.KG, Kaiserslautern, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Däumer', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Seq-IT GmbH & Co.KG, Kaiserslautern, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaiser', 'firstname': 'Rolf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Virology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nGerman Center for Infection Research, Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kusejko', 'firstname': 'Katharina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Metzner', 'firstname': 'Karin J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nInstitute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimkait', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Virology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",HIV-1 diversity in viral reservoirs obtained from circulating T-cell subsets during early ART and beyond.
"Broadly reactive antibodies that target sequence-diverse antigens are of interest for vaccine design and monoclonal antibody therapeutic development because they can protect against multiple strains of a virus and provide a barrier to evolution of escape mutants. Using LIBRA-seq (linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing) data for the B cell repertoire of an individual chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we identified a lineage of IgG3 antibodies predicted to bind to HIV-1 Envelope (Env) and influenza A Hemagglutinin (HA). Two lineage members, antibodies 2526 and 546, were confirmed to bind to a large panel of diverse antigens, including several strains of HIV-1 Env, influenza HA, coronavirus (CoV) spike, hepatitis C virus (HCV) E protein, Nipah virus (NiV) F protein, and Langya virus (LayV) F protein. We found that both antibodies bind to complex glycans on the antigenic surfaces. Antibody 2526 targets the stem region of influenza HA and the N-terminal domain (NTD) region of SARS-CoV-2 spike. A crystal structure of 2526 Fab bound to mannose revealed the presence of a glycan-binding pocket on the light chain. Antibody 2526 cross-reacted with antigens from multiple pathogens and displayed no signs of autoreactivity. These features distinguish antibody 2526 from previously described glycan-reactive antibodies. Further study of this antibody class may aid in the selection and engineering of broadly reactive antibody therapeutics and can inform the development of effective vaccines with exceptional breadth of pathogen coverage.",,"[{'lastname': 'Vukovich', 'firstname': 'Matthew J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee,

"Sexually transmitted infections are a significant, and growing, public health problem in this country - particularly among youth. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce the community burden of infection. Preliminary studies indicate that individuals involved in the criminal legal system have high rates of infection. While gaps exist in providing screening for incarcerated individuals, there are minimal efforts that have been initiated to screen individuals diverted from incarceration. In this study, we examined the STI risk profile and feasibility of screening for sexually transmitted infections for youth who were attending an alternative sentencing program after arrest for a minor offense. Youth were screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea using urine-based nucleic acid amplification tests.
Of the 307 participants engaged in a program providing supportive services for criminal legal system involved youth at the Brooklyn Court House in New York City, 186 agreed to screening for sexually transmitted infections, and 8% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both.
Screening programs within carceral settings have proven effective in identifying individuals with STIs. However, with policy changes diverting more young people away from incarceration and into community-based programs, innovative programs are needed to identify STIs among youth in these settings. Our findings indicate that it is feasible to conduct venue-based screening in these settings, and, doing so may identify youth in need of treatment and further evaluation.","Of the 307 participants engaged in a program providing supportive services for criminal legal system involved youth at the Brooklyn Court House in New York City, 186 agreed to screening for sexually transmitted infections, and 8% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both.","[{'lastname': 'Cohall', 'firstname': 'Alwyn', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, USA.

"Humanitarian crises-natural or human-made events that can threaten communities' health, safety, security, and well-being-may affect the HIV epidemic dynamics. Common aspects of humanitarian crises such as poverty, powerlessness, disruptions to the health systems, and social instability can contribute to a person's vulnerability to HIV infection through increased risk behaviors and limited access to health services. Guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of literature published in English between January 1990 and March 2022 to characterize the global evidence of modifiable and non-modifiable factors for HIV acquisition in the context of humanitarian crises. We systematically searched, screened, and synthesized literature from MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health (all accessed via Ovid), and Scopus, and also grey literature through websites of humanitarian agencies and relevant non-government organizations, the International AIDS Society's abstract databases, and Google Scholar. We considered studies presenting empirical data on HIV prevalence, incidence, or risk factors in humanitarian crises-affected populations, including refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. Forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were quantitative (n = 43, 87.8%) and cross-sectional (n = 37, 75.5%) in design. Most were single-country studies (n = 43, 87.8%) and conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (n = 31, 63.3%). We identified 5 non-modifiable factors for HIV acquisition (i.e., age, gender, location, place of birth or origin, and ethnicity) and 60 modifiable factors that we further classified into five categories, namely 18 policy and structural, 9 sociocultural, 11 health and mental health, 16 sexual practice, and 6 humanitarian crisis-related traumatic event factors. Within the modifiable categories, factors that were most often investigated were education level, marital status, sexually transmitted infection diagnosis, condom use, and experience of rape or sexual trauma, respectively. Informed by the findings, we applied the social-ecological model to map the identified multidimensional factors associated with HIV acquisition at the levels of individual, social and sexual networks, community, public policy, and the context of humanitarian crises. The current review provides a comprehensive, global analysis of the available evidence on HIV prevalence, incidence, and risk factors in humanitarian crises and implications for potential programs and research. Future research is warranted to further understand the directionality of the non-modifiable and modifiable factors affecting HIV acquisition, and the multilevel barriers and facilitators to the uptake of HIV prevention strategies in the context of humanitarian crises. Such research can generate actionable evidence to inform the development of ethical, trauma-informed, and culturally appropriate HIV prevention interventions in humanitarian settings.
Las crisis humanitarias (eventos naturales o provocados por el hombre que pueden amenazar la salud, la seguridad y el bienestar de las comunidades) pueden afectar la dinámica de la epidemia del VIH. Los aspectos comunes de las crisis humanitarias como la pobreza, la impotencia, las perturbaciones de los sistemas de salud y la inestabilidad social pueden contribuir a la vulnerabilidad de una persona a la infección por VIH a través del aumento de comportamientos de riesgo y el acceso limitado a los servicios de salud. Guiados por la metodología del Instituto Joanna Briggs para las revisiones de alcance y la extensión de las directrices para la presentación de elementos de informe preferidos para revisiones sistemáticas y metaanálisis para revisiones de alcance (PRISMA-ScR), llevamos a cabo una revisión de alcance de la literatura publicada en inglés entre enero de 1990 y marzo de 2022 para caracterizar la evidencia global de factores modificables y no modificables para la adquisición del VIH en el contexto de crisis humanitarias. Buscamos, seleccionamos y sintetizamos sistemáticamente literatura de MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health (todas accedidas a través de Ovid) y Scopus y literatura gris a través de sitios web de agencias humanitarias y organizaciones no gubernamentales relevantes, las bases de datos de resúmenes de la Sociedad Internacional del SIDA y Google Académico. Consideramos estudios que presentaban datos empíricos sobre la prevalencia, incidencia o factores de riesgo del VIH en poblaciones afectadas por crisis humanitarias, incluyendo las personas refugiadas, solicitantes de asilo y desplazadas internamente. Cuarenta y nueve estudios cumplieron los criterios de inclusión. La mayoría de los estudios fueron de diseño cuantitativo (n = 43, 87.8%) y transversal (n = 37, 75.5%). La mayoría fueron estudios de un solo país (n = 43, 87.8%) y realizados en África subsahariana (n = 31, 63.3%). Identificamos cinco factores no modificables para la adquisición del VIH (es decir, edad, género, ubicación geográfica, lugar de nacimiento u origen y grupo étnico) y 60 factores modificables que clasificamos en cinco categorías, a saber 18 políticos y estructurales, 9 socioculturales, 11 factores de salud y salud mental, 16 de práctica sexual y 6 de eventos traumáticos relacionados con crisis humanitarias. Dentro de las categorías modificables, los factores que se investigaron con mayor frecuencia fueron el nivel educativo, el estado civil, el diagnóstico de infecciones de transmisión sexual, el uso de condón y la experiencia de violación o trauma sexual, respectivamente. Informados por los hallazgos, aplicamos el modelo socioecológico para asignar los factores multidimensionales asociados con la adquisición del VIH identificados a los niveles individual, de redes sociales y sexuales, comunidad, políticas públicas y contexto de crisis humanitaria. La revisión presente proporciona un análisis integral y global de la evidencia disponible sobre la prevalencia, la incidencia y los factores de riesgo del VIH en crisis humanitarias y sus implicaciones para posibles programas e investigaciones. Se necesitan más investigaciones para comprender mejor la direccionalidad de los factores modificables y no modificables que afectan la adquisición de VIH, y las barreras y facilitadores multinivel para el uso de estrategias para la prevención del VIH en el contexto de las crisis humanitarias. Dicha investigación puede generar evidencia accionable para informar el desarrollo de intervenciones para la prevención del VIH que sean éticas, informadas sobre el trauma, y culturalmente apropiadas en entornos humanitarios.",,"[{'lastname': 'Harsono', 'firstname': 'Dini', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale School of Public Health, 135 College St, Suite 200, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. dini.harsono@yale.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Atre', 'firstname': 'Swarali', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.\nManagement Sciences for Health, Arlington, VA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyhan', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.\nDepartment of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garmroudi', 'firstname': 'Dina', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'J Lucian', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale School of Public Health, 135 College St, Suite 200, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.\nDepartment of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ho', 'firstname': 'Winnie', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Khoshnood', 'firstname': 'Kaveh', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale School of Public Health, 135 College St, Suite 200, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.'}]",A Scoping Review of Factors Associated with HIV Acquisition in the Context of Humanitarian Crises.
"Despite significant advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, adherence remains a challenge. While Brazil has validated scales for treatment adherence, few assess treatment adherence barriers. This underscores the necessity for validated questionnaires on adherence barriers to identify patient-specific challenges and enhance strategies for ART adherence. This study aimed to adapt and validate the Adherence Barriers Questionnaire for HIV Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy (ABQ-HIV), a 17-item questionnaire assessing the adherence barriers to ART, for the Brazilian context and to evaluate its psychometric properties in HIV patients. A methodological study on the psychometric properties and factorial structure of ABQ-HIV was conducted. The study followed seven steps: consent of the original authors, two translations, synthesis of the translations, expert committee, back-translation, pre-test, and reliability test. A high content validity index (0.93) was achieved with the expert committee. The study sample consisted of 230 adults with HIV, with 37.0 (29.3-45.0) years as the median age (IQR), and 52.2% were male. The exploratory factor analysis with a three subscales structure of 17 items showed good interpretability (Bartlett's sphericity (1167.2 [136]; p < 0.001) and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin = 0.602) and internal consistency (α = 0.76; Ω = 0.76). The fit indicators were satisfactory (χ2 = 89.931; df = 88; p > 0.005; RMSEA = 0.010; RMSR = 0.07; CFI = 0.996; GFI = 0.940; AGFI = 0.907; NNFI = 0.995). The Brazilian version of ABQ-HIV is a potential instrument for identifying specific barriers to adherence to ART in adults living with HIV in Brazil.

"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection can activate the expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), particularly HERV-K (HML-2). HIV controllers (HICs) are rare people living with HIV (PLWHs) who naturally control HIV-1 replication and overexpress some cellular restriction factors that negatively regulate the LTR-driven transcription of HIV-1 proviruses.
To understand the ability of HICs to control the expression of endogenous retroviruses.
We measured endogenous retrovirus type K6 (ERVK-6) RNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HICs (n = 23), antiretroviral (ART)-suppressed subjects (n = 8), and HIV-1-negative (NEG) individuals (n = 10) and correlated the transcript expression of ERVK-6 with multiple HIV-1 cellular restriction factors.
Our study revealed that ERVK-6 RNA expression in PBMCs from HICs was significantly downregulated compared with that in both the ART and NEG control groups. Moreover, we detected that ERVK-6 RNA levels in PBMCs across all groups were negatively correlated with the expression levels of p21 and MCPIP1, two cellular restriction factors that limit the activation of macrophages and T cells by downregulating the activity of NF-kB.
These findings support the hypothesis that HICs activate innate antiviral mechanisms that may simultaneously downregulate the transcription of both exogenous (HIV-1) and endogenous (ERVK-6) retroviruses. Future studies with larger cohorts should be performed to confirm this hypothesis and to explore the role of p21 and MCPIP1 in regulating HERV-K expression in physiological and pathological conditions.",,"[{'lastname': 'de Azevedo', 'firstname': 'Suwellen Sardinha Dias', 'initials': 'SSD', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribeiro-Alves', 'firstname': 'Marcelo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Côrtes', 'firstname': 'Fernanda Heloise', 'initials': 'FH', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Delatorre', 'firstname': 'Edson', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Departamento de Patologia, Laboratório de Genômica e Ecologia Viral, Vitória, ES, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoagland', 'firstname': 'Brenda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Villela', 'firstname': 'Larissa M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Grinsztejn', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Veloso', 'firstname': 'Valdilea Gonçalvez', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em DST/AIDS, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Morgado', 'firstname': 'Mariza G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza', 'firstname': 'Thiago Moreno L', 'initials': 'TML', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de Imunofarmacologia, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.\nFundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia de Inovação em Doenças de Populações Negligenciadas, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Gonzalo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Fundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de AIDS & Imunologia Molecular, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.\nFundação Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Laboratório de Arbovírus e Vírus Hemorrágicos, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.'}]",HIV-1 controllers exhibit an enhanced antiretroviral innate state characterised by overexpression of p21 and MCPIP1 and silencing of ERVK-6 RNA expression.
"In this article, we examine the concept of cultural authority in the context of the professionalization/corporatization of medicine at the end of the 20th century, and its political and moral contours since the HIV/AIDS epidemic in São Paulo. Based on journalistic articles collected from the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo (1986-1989), we seek to highlight the place of medical expertise, examining the discourses produced about the disease in Brazil, in bases that show the emergence of social actors, disputes for credibility and the clinical authority under challenge. We analyze public narratives about AIDS, situating the place of authority. We argue that such discourses, in the context of sexual panic, did not occur outside a dynamic of therapeutic/clinical authority and the profession's own norms, which also immediately made visible the role of physicians, specialists and other health professionals, in dialogue with the moral grammar of the socially current illness. The conclusions illustrate the link between Brazilian medicine at the end of the century and the local-global history of AIDS, concentrating historical and political movements that disputed the scientific and moral meanings of the disease, fractured by the clash between authorities in the scientific, sanitary and clinical fields.

Analisamos as narrativas públicas sobre a Aids, situando o lugar da autoridade. Argumentamos que tais discursos, no contexto do pânico sexual, não ocorriam fora de uma dinâmica de autoridade terapêutica/clínica e das normatizações próprias da profissão, que também tornavam imediatamente visível o papel dos médicos, especialistas e demais profissionais de saúde, em diálogo com a gramática moral da doença socialmente corrente.

"Introduction India has the second-highest number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Despite the national decline in the prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 2000 to 2021, regional variations persist, particularly in the northeastern and southern states. High-risk populations, including female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDU), significantly contribute to these dynamics. This study focuses on high-prevalence districts in Karnataka. Objectives This study aims to identify socioeconomic and behavioral factors associated with high HIV prevalence in high-burden districts of South Indian states. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) and Designated STI/RTI (sexually transmitted infections/reproductive tract infections) Clinics (DSRCs) across 24 centers in the three districts. The centers were determined using a simple random sampling method. Data from 2501 HIV-positive individuals were analyzed, focusing on demographics, risk behaviors, and treatment history. Results Males constituted the majority of HIV cases, accounting for 448 (56.0%) in Vijayapura, 334 (51.4%) in Bagalkot, and 644 (61.1%) in Belagavi districts, with a significant portion referred by government hospitals. High HIV prevalence was linked to adults aged 25-49 years of age; the number of people with HIV was high among daily wage workers and individuals with multiple sexual partners compared to married and educated people. Newly diagnosed discordant couples ranged from 129 (12.2%) in Belagavi to 133 (18.4%) in Vijayapura districts. Most patients were on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), with loss to follow-up attributed to system negligence and poor compliance. Conclusion Key determinants of high HIV prevalence include gender, age, marital status, socioeconomic status, and sexual behavior. Effective interventions require targeted education, improved healthcare services, robust surveillance, and strengthened collaboration among stakeholders.",,"[{'lastname': 'Pattankar', 'firstname': 'Tanuja P', 'initials': 'TP', 'affiliation': 'Community Medicine, Shri B.

"Persons seeking emergency injury care are often from higher-risk and underserved key populations (KPs) and priority populations (PPs) for HIV programming. While facility-based HIV Testing Services (HTS) in Kenya are effective, emergency department (ED) delivery is limited, despite the potential to reach underserved persons.
This quasi-experimental prospective study evaluated implementation of the HIV Enhanced Access Testing in Emergency Departments (HEATED) at Kenyatta National Hospital ED in Nairobi, Kenya. The HEATED program was designed as a multi-component intervention employing setting appropriate strategies for HIV care sensitization and integration, task shifting, resource reorganization, linkage advocacy, skills development and education to promote ED-HTS with a focus on higher-risk persons. KPs included sex workers, gay men, men who have sex with men, transgender persons and persons who inject drugs. PPs included young persons (18-24 years), victims of interpersonal violence, persons with hazardous alcohol use and persons never HIV tested. Data were obtained from systems-level records, enrolled injured patient participants and healthcare providers. Systems and patient-level data were collected during a pre-implementation period (6 March - 16 April 2023) and post-implementation (period 1, 1 May - 26 June 2023). Additional, systems-level data were collected during a second post-implementation (period 2, 27 June - 20 August 2023). HTS data were evaluated as facility-based HIV testing (completed in the ED) and distribution of HIV self-tests independently, and aggregated as ED-HTS. Evaluation analyses were completed across reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance framework domains.
All 151 clinical staff were reached through trainings and sensitizations on the HEATED program. Systems-level ED-HTS among all presenting patients increased from 16.7% pre-implementation to 23.0% post-implementation periods 1 and 2 (RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.21-1.43;

"Digital health interventions have the potential to improve linkage to care after HIV self-testing (HIVST). This study aimed to understand clients' and providers' perceptions of benefits, and barriers of a digital health intervention designed to improve linkage to care after HIV self-testing in Tanzania.
This exploratory qualitative research study was conducted in Hai and Moshi, districts in Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. Four health facilities were selected based on their involvement in an HIVST pilot program implemented by Elizabeth Glassier Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) Tanzania through the USAID funded program. The study included female index clients and their partners, and healthcare providers at the healthcare facilities. We used a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions for data collection. Data collection was conducted from 16th January 2023 to 3rd February 2023. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was conducted, guided by the Health Belief Model (HBM), and results were developed in collaboration with the community partners.
A total of 42 participants were included in the study, comprising 9 male clients, 17 female index clients, and 16 health care workers (HCWs) (4 male and 12 female) who were involved in delivering HIVST services. The study's findings revealed mixed feelings about the use of a digital health intervention. Majority of participants perceived digital health as a valuable intervention for enhancing linkage to care, improved health outcomes, improved communication with healthcare workers, and increased privacy. Therefore, they supported scale-up of a digital health intervention. Participants also expressed that the potential benefits of a digital health intervention include the convenience of accessing healthcare services from the comfort of their homes or any location. However, a few participants expressed concerns about potential risks associated with sending health-related text messages. They feared that recipients might not be in a safe space, leading to stigma and avoidance of engagement. A few female participants expressed concerns about confidentiality breaches, particularly regarding shared phones with family or friends. Fear of being judged or misunderstood by others could deter them from reading or acting upon these messages. Most participants recommended tailored strategies that prioritize confidentiality and trust. Recognizing these psychological aspects is vital for customizing digital health interventions to effectively address participants' concerns.

"Women living with HIV (WLWH) in low- middle-income countries (LMICs) face increased mortality risks from comorbidities despite progress in antiretroviral therapy. Palliative care (PC) is vital for these patients, yet its integration in LMICs, such as Nigeria, is suboptimal due to unique challenges.
This study investigated the knowledge, perceived barriers, and facilitators influencing PC integration into routine HIV care within healthcare (HC) settings.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted among WLWH in twelve HC facilities throughout Nigeria. Data collection involved surveys focused on PC knowledge, attitudes, facilitators, and barriers. Logistic regression analyses were employed to examine the data.
This study revealed significant gaps in knowledge and attitudes towards PC among HIV + women at NISA-MIRCs. Over 90% were unaware of PC services, but many saw its potential to offer hope (55%) and improve quality of life (56.5%). The key predictors of PC knowledge included education, occupation, religion, having fewer children, urban residence, type of residence, and having a high income (p < .05). Despite the willingness to access PC, barriers such as negative HC worker attitudes, perceived high cost, and limited decision autonomy could hinder integration. Facilitators included low-cost services, positive HCW attitudes, physician recommendations, and perceived necessity for personal well-being.
Knowledge gaps, diverse attitudes, and significant barriers highlight the need for targeted PC interventions for WLWH. Tailoring educational programs, addressing cost barriers, and improving healthcare infrastructure are crucial to enhancing PC accessibility and quality. These findings can guide policymakers and HC practitioners toward more effective and inclusive care strategies.","This study revealed significant gaps in knowledge and attitudes towards PC among HIV + women at NISA-MIRCs.

"Cervical cancer, a prevalent malignancy in the female reproductive tract, exhibits a high incidence. Existing evidence indicates a robust correlation between alterations in vaginal flora composition and the progression of cervical cancer. Nevertheless, there is a lack of clarity concerning the specific microorganisms within the vaginal microbiota that are linked to the onset and development of cervical cancer, as well as the mechanisms through which they exert carcinogenic effects. The 16 S ribosomal (rRNA) and metagenomic sequencing technology were used to analyze vaginal microorganisms, and screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cervical cancer-associated microbial markers using fold change in mean bacterial abundance. Moreover, vaginal microenvironmental factors were detected, and the local vaginal inflammatory state in patients with cervical cancer was subjected to assay via qRT-PCR and ELISA. The hub inflammatory genes were screened by transcriptome sequencing after co-culture of bacteria and normal cervical epithelial cells, and an in vitro model was utilized to assess the impacts of inflammatory factors on cervical cancer. Both cervical cancer patients and HPV-positive patients showed significant changes in the composition of the vaginal flora, characterised by a decrease in the abundance of Lactobacillus and an increase in the abundance of a variety of anaerobic bacteria; The microbial sequencing identified Porphyromonas, Porphyromonas_asaccharolytica, and Porphyromonas_uenonis as microbial markers for HPV-associated cervical cancer. Vaginal inflammatory factors in patients with cervical cancer were overexpressed. After Porphyromonas_asaccharolytica intervention on cervical epithelial H8 cells, interleukin (IL)-1β, a hub differential gene, markedly promoted tumor-associated biological behaviors at the in vitro cytological level in cervical cancer. This study for the first demonstrated that Porphyromonas, Porphyromonas_asaccharolytica, and Porphyromonas_uenonis could serve as novel microbial markers for cervical cancer. Moreover, Porphyromonas_asaccharolytica was identified as having the ability to induce the overexpression of inflammatory genes in cervical epithelial cells to create a favorable microenvironment for the onset and development of cervical cancer. The effects of dysbacteriosis on cervical cancer were microbiologically elucidated.",,"[{'lastname': 'Bai', 'firstname': 'Bing', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830017, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuerxun', 'firstname': 'Gulixian', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Xinjiang Medical University Cancer Hospital, Urumqi, 830000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuerdi', 'firstname': 'Awahan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Urumqi Shayibake District Maternal and Child Health Service Centre, Urumqi, 830000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Maimaiti', 'firstname': 'Rexianguli', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Xinjiang Medical University Cancer Hospital, Urumqi, 830000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yuping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830017, China.

"The HIV prevalence in Maputo city is 16.2%. There is a lack of data describing associated factors with disclosure or non-disclosure of HIV-positive sero-status to sexual partners. This analysis describes associated factors of non-disclosure of HIV sero-status to sexual partners among people living with HIV (PLHIV) participating in a serostatus disclosure support program at three health facilities in Maputo, Mozambique. We used a cross-sectional design of PLHIV aged over 18 years. Datas were collected between December 2019 and September 2020. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated of non-disclosure of HIV sero-status. A total of 377 patients were enrolled in the HIV sero-status disclosure Program. Of these, nearly two-thirds (61.5%) were women, 52.9% had completed secondary school, 47.7% were 25-34 years old, 50.9% had informal employment with low income, and 73.2% were married. Univariate logistic regression model showed greater odds of non-disclosure among patients who had an employment contract with a maximum wage (Crude Odds Ratio [cOR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-3.55, p = 0.015); were single (cOR 3.85, 95% CI 2.22-6.69, p < 0.001); were living with parents (cOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.07-4.93, p = 0.033); received financial support for their monthly household expenses from parents or a close relative (cOR 7.15, 95% CI 2.19-23.36, p = 0.001); or brought a parent/close relative and/or a friend as a confidant during HIV care(cOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.74-5.76, p < 0.001; and cOR 5.97, 95% CI 1.57-22.66, p = 0.009, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression model showed: from parents/close relative and from partner (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 8.19, 95% CI 1.44-46.46, p = 0.018; and aOR 4.34, 95% CI 1.05-17.17, p = 0.043), respectively); in those who brought a parent/close relative and/or a friend as a confidant during HIV care (aOR 8.86, 95% CI 2.16-36.31, p = 0.002; and 195 aOR 21.68, 95% CI 3.02-155.87, p = 0.002, respectively). Non-disclosure of serostatus is a critical issue for HIV care and treatment programs, given that non-disclosure of HIV serostatus increases risk of HIV transmission. Understanding the factors associated with non-disclosure is crucial for designing strategies to address these factors and end the HIV epidemic by 2030.

"Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) stands out as the sole thermobiphasic fungus pathogenic to mammals, including humans, within the fungal community encompassing Ascomycota, Eurotium, Eurotiumles, Fungiaceae, and Cyanobacteria. Thriving as a saprophytic fungus in its natural habitat, it transitions into a pathogenic yeast phase at the mammalian physiological temperature of 37°C. Historically, talaromycosis has been predominantly associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), classified among the three primary opportunistic infections linked with AIDS, alongside tuberculosis and cryptococcosis. As advancements are made in HIV/AIDS treatment and control measures, the incidence of talaromycosis co-infection with HIV is declining annually, whereas the population of non-HIV-infected talaromycosis patients is steadily increasing. These patients exhibit diverse risk factors such as various types of immunodeficiency, malignant tumors, autoimmune diseases, and organ transplantation, among others. Yet, a limited number of retrospective studies have centered on the clinical characteristics and risk factors of HIV-negative talaromycosis patients, especially in children and patients with hematological malignancies, resulting in an inadequate understanding of this patient cohort. Consequently, we conducted a comprehensive review encompassing the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of HIV-negative talaromycosis patients, concluding with a prospectus of the disease's frontier research direction. The aim is to enhance comprehension, leading to advancements in the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients, ultimately improving their prognosis.

"HIV-1 management has advanced significantly with antiretroviral therapy (ART), yet challenges persist, including low-level HIV-1 viraemia (LLV). LLV presents a complex scenario, with varied definitions in the literature, reflecting uncertainties in its clinical interpretation. Questions arise regarding the underlying mechanisms of LLV, whether it signifies ongoing viral replication or stems from other factors. This study aimed to systematically review strategies for LLV management, providing insights into optimal clinical approaches.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health were searched for relevant literature on LLV management. We included studies published between 2004 and 2024, assessing interventions such as ART modification, genotypic resistance testing, adherence assessment, performing therapeutic drug monitoring, testing for chronic coinfections and assessing the viral reservoir via HIV DNA quantification. Meta-analyses were conducted where feasible.
The systematic review identified 48 eligible records. Findings indicated limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of ART regimen modification in achieving virological suppression among individuals with LLV. However, studies assessing genotypic resistance testing revealed a significant association between resistance-associated mutations and virological suppression during LLV. Adherence to ART emerged as a critical determinant of treatment efficacy, with interventions showing promise in achieving viral suppression. The clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in managing LLV remained inconclusive. Gaps in the literature were identified regarding follow-up scheduling, managing concurrent chronic infections and assessing inflammatory markers in LLV management.
While ART modification may not consistently achieve virological suppression, genotypic resistance testing may offer insights into treatment outcomes. Adherence to ART emerged as a crucial factor, necessitating tailored interventions. However, further research is needed to elucidate the clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring and other management strategies. The study highlights the importance of ongoing research to refine therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes in LLV management.

"While antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective, detection of low levels of HIV-1 RNA in plasma is common in treated individuals. Given the uncertainties on the topic, we convened a panel of experts to consider different clinical scenarios, producing a Delphi consensus to help guide clinical practice.
A panel of 17 experts in infectious diseases, virology and immunology rated 32 statements related to four distinct scenarios: (1) low-level viremia during stable (≥6 months) first-line ART (≥2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements 50-500 copies/mL); (2) a viral blip during otherwise suppressive ART (a HIV-1 RNA measurement 50-1000 copies/mL with adjacent measurements <50 copies/mL); (3) low-level viral rebound during previously suppressive ART (≥2 consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements 50-500 copies/mL); (4) residual viremia during suppressive ART (persistent HIV-1 RNA quantification below 50 copies/mL). A systematic review, conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement, informed the 32 statements. The Delphi procedure was modified to include two voting rounds separated by a moderated group discussion. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations-based recommendations were developed.
Overall, 18/32 statements (56.2%) achieved a strong consensus, 3/32 (9.4%) achieved a moderate consensus and 11/32 (34.4%) did not achieve a consensus. Across the four scenarios, the panel unanimously emphasised the importance of implementing specific interventions prior to considering therapy changes, including assessing adherence, testing for genotypic drug resistance and scheduling more frequent follow-up visits. Strategies indicated in selected circumstances included therapeutic drug monitoring, quantifying total HIV-1 DNA and evaluating concomitant chronic infections.
While acknowledging the many uncertainties about source, significance and optimal management of low-level viremia during ART, the findings provide insights to help harmonise clinical practice. There is a need for well-designed randomised studies assessing different interventions to manage low-level viremia and future research regarding its definition.","Overall, 18/32 statements (56.2%) achieved a strong consensus, 3/32 (9.4%) achieved a moderate consensus and 11/32 (34.4%) did not achieve a consensus.

To assess the current status of HPV vaccine hesitancy among college students in Guangdong Province after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to systematically analyze the influencing factors of HPV vaccine hesitancy and construct a prediction model based on the WHO 3Cs model. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in June 2023 among female college students in four cities in Guangdong Province. The data were analyzed using binary logistic regression with a focus on the 3Cs model: Complacency, Convenience, and Confidence. LASSO regression was employed to analyze the variables deemed to be of significance and to construct predictive models. Out of 1399 participants, 86.5% expressed no hesitancy toward HPV vaccination. However, 11.9% exhibited hesitancy, and 1.6% refused vaccination altogether. Factors such as trust in vaccine efficacy, perception of HPV infection risk, price considerations, and constraints like distance or time were significant contributors to hesitancy. Knowledge of the HPV vaccine, socio-demographic characteristics, and the educational level of participants' mothers also played a role in vaccine hesitancy.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of syphilis and associated factors among people aged 18 to 49 years old in the city of Belém, brazilian amazon.
Observational, cross-sectional study carried out in a sanitary administrative district of a capital of the Brazilian Amazon, Belém, state of Pará, Brazil. Data collection was conducted from August 2021 to February 2022. The participantes consisted of residents of the Montese, Guamá and Condor neighborhoods. People aged 18 to 49 years were included. This variable was treated as dichotomous (reagent and non-reagent). The selected response event was 'reagent result'. The independent variables were the social factors and access to health services. To identify associated factors with the presence of markers of the bacteria studied, multiple logistic rules were performed.
178 people participated in the study; the median age was 35.0 years. The prevalence of IgG and/or IgM antibodies against T. pallidum was 7 % (13). In the final regression model, it was observed that participants who had sexual intercourse after using alcohol and drugs and those who did not know about the prevention of sexually transmitted infections were five times more likely to have tested positive for T. pallidum.

"Background In Latin American countries and Suriname, sexual transmission is one of the most common modes of HIV transmission, and men who have sex with men (MSM) who engage in sex work constitute a key population. Methods In a sample of MSM (N =53,166) from the Latin American Internet Survey (2018) across 18 countries, we examined how sex work engagement is associated with syndemic conditions (multidrug use, homophobic abuse, depression/anxiety, alcohol dependency (CAGE alcohol questionnaire) and internalised homonegativity) and condomless anal intercourse with non-steady male partners using separate logistic regressions. We then used a structural equation model to determine if and how syndemic conditions mediate the relationship between sex work engagement and non-steady male partners. Results We found that getting paid for sex was associated with less condom use for anal intercourse with non-steady male partners and particular syndemic conditions, such as multidrug use, homophobic abuse and alcohol dependency. In our structural equation model, the results showed that the direct relationship between sex work engagement and non-steady male partners was positive and significant, and syndemic conditions partially mediated this relationship. Conclusion Our results highlight the continuing need for including MSM who engage in sex work and those who experience syndemic conditions in the prevention strategies targeted to MSM in Latin America and Suriname, to prevent the transmission of HIV.",,"[{'lastname': 'Sönmez', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Estudis Epidemiològics sobre les ITS i Sida de Catalunya (CEEISCAT), Badalona, Spain; and Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Lorente', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Estudis Epidemiològics sobre les ITS i Sida de Catalunya (CEEISCAT), Badalona, Spain; and Community-Based Research Laboratory, Coalition PLUS, Pantin, France; and CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Mesías-Gazmuri', 'firstname': 'Jocelyn', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Estudis Epidemiològics sobre les ITS i Sida de Catalunya (CEEISCAT), Badalona, Spain; and Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain; and Doctorat Metodologia de la Recerca Biomèdica i Salut Publica, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Axel J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Sigma Research, Department of Public Health, Environments and Society, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jonas', 'firstname': 'Kai J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Stuardo Avila', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Public Health, Universidad Andrés Bello, Santiago de Chile, Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Marcus', 'firstname': 'Ulrich', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Robert Koch Institut, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Veras', 'firstname': 'Maria Amelia', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Santa Casa de São Paulo School of Medical Sciences, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Casabona Barbarà', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Estudis Epidemiològics sobre les ITS i Sida de Catalunya (CEEISCAT), Badalona, Spain; and Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Folch', 'firstname': 'Cinta', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Centre d'Estudis Epidemiològics sobre les ITS i Sida de Catalunya (CEEISCAT), Badalona, Spain; and Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain; and CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Pública (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.""}]","Sex work, syndemic conditions and condomless anal intercourse among men who have sex with men who engage in sex work in Latin America."
"Women exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) experience multiple social and structural barriers to accessing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), despite being at increased risk for HIV. In addition, few existing HIV prevention interventions address IPV. A recently developed PrEP decision aid for women has the potential to reach IPV survivors at risk for HIV if it could be integrated into existing domestic violence agencies that prioritize trust and rapport with female IPV survivors. Leveraging non-traditional service delivery mechanisms in the community could expand reach to women who are IPV survivors for PrEP.
We conducted qualitative interviews and online qualitative surveys with 33 IPV survivors and 9 domestic violence agency staff at two agencies in Connecticut. We applied the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to understand barriers and facilitators to delivering a novel PrEP decision aid to IPV survivors in the context of domestic violence service agencies.
Most IPV survivors and agency staff thought the PrEP decision aid intervention could be compatible with agencies' existing practices, especially if adapted to be trauma-responsive and delivered by trusted counselors and staff members. PrEP conversations could be packaged into already well-developed safety planning and wellness practices. Agency staff noted some concerns about prioritizing urgent safety needs over longer-term preventive health needs during crisis periods and expressed interest in receiving further training on PrEP to provide resources for their clients.

"High HIV viral loads (VL) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and on-going transmission. HIV controllers maintain low VLs in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We previously used a massively multiplexed antibody profiling assay (VirScan) to compare antibody profiles in HIV controllers and persons living with HIV (PWH) who were virally suppressed on ART. In this report, we used VirScan to evaluate whether antibody reactivity to specific HIV targets and broad reactivity across the HIV genome was associated with VL and controller status 1-2 years after infection.
Samples were obtained from participants who acquired HIV infection in a community-randomized trial in Africa that evaluated an integrated strategy for HIV prevention (HPTN 071 PopART). Controller status was determined using VL and antiretroviral (ARV) drug data obtained at the seroconversion visit and 1 year later. Viremic controllers had VLs <2,000 copies/mL at both visits; non-controllers had VLs >2,000 copies/mL at both visits. Both groups had no ARV drugs detected at either visit. VirScan testing was performed at the second HIV-positive visit (1-2 years after HIV infection).
The study cohort included 13 viremic controllers and 64 non-controllers. We identified ten clusters of homologous peptides that had high levels of antibody reactivity (three in gag, three in env, two in integrase, one in protease, and one in vpu). Reactivity to 43 peptides (eight unique epitopes) in six of these clusters was associated with lower VL; reactivity to six of the eight epitopes was associated with HIV controller status. Higher aggregate antibody reactivity across the eight epitopes (more epitopes targeted, higher mean reactivity across all epitopes) and across the HIV genome was also associated with lower VL and controller status.
We identified HIV antibody targets associated with lower VL and HIV controller status 1-2 years after infection. Robust aggregate responses to these targets and broad antibody reactivity across the HIV genome were also associated with lower VL and controller status. These findings provide novel insights into the relationship between humoral immunity and viral containment that could help inform the design of antibody-based approaches for reducing HIV VL.","The study cohort included 13 viremic controllers and 64 non-controllers.

The objective of the present study was to improve insight into the profiles of persons recently infected with HIV-1 and on their prevention trajectory. Between May 2018 and December 2022, we selected persons diagnosed in Belgium within three months of the presumed infection date. We then analyzed information collected using a questionnaire covering topics on HIV testing, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), PrEP use, sexual behavior, partner notification and substance use. The data obtained were analyzed alongside information derived from phylogenetic cluster analysis of the viral source of infection. A total of 93 persons with a recent HIV-1 infection completed the questionnaire, the majority (74%) being MSM, 14% were heterosexual women and 12% were heterosexual men. Nearly one-third of participants engaged in sexual activity with an average of 2 to 5 casual partners around the presumed time of infection. A significant percentage reported frequent substance use during sexual activity (65%), being previously diagnosed with STI (65%) and using condoms infrequently (44%). 63% reported a testing frequency of at least one HIV test per year before being diagnosed and 46% notified their previous sex partner(s) after being diagnosed. Over 20% of respondents (including 11 MSM, 4 heterosexual men and 5 heterosexual women) reported exclusive sexual activity with their steady partner. Eight participants (9%, all MSM, 75% born outside of Belgium) reported PrEP use in the past. No significant differences in behavioral characteristics were found between persons who were part of a local transmission cluster (48%) and persons that were not part of a cluster (47%). The study results revealed that the majority of persons diagnosed early with HIV-1 infection in Belgium exhibited characteristics corresponding to a high-at-risk population and were aware of this risk, as evidenced by a high testing frequency. However, partner notification rates were low and use and awareness of PrEP limited. A notable group of persons not corresponding to the high-risk profiles was also identified. This information may help to expose missed opportunities for prevention and contribute to enhancing the implementation of future prevention measures.",,"[{'lastname': 'Vanden Bulcke', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. charlotte.vandenbulcke@uzgent.be.'}, {'lastname': 'Deblonde', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Sciensano, Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Necsoi', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Univ Libre Bruxelles, CHU St Pierre, Serv Malad Infect, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Praet', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department Nephrol & Infect Dis, AZ Sint-Jan Brugge AV, Brugge, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Cutsem', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department Microbiol, Vrije Univ Brussel, Univ Ziekenhuis Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Mertens', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department Clin Sci, HIV & STD Unit, Inst Trop Med, Med Serv, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanroye', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department Clin Sci, Aids Reference Lab, Clin Reference Lab, Inst Trop Med, Antwerp, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Stoffels', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aids Reference Lab, Ctr Hosp Univ St Pierre, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Debaisieux', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Aids Reference Lab, Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Hôpital Universitaire de Bruxelles (H.U.B), CUB Hôpital Erasme, Ixelles, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Mortier', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department Diagnost Sci, Aids Reference Lab, Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Callens', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Verhofstede', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department Diagnost Sci, Aids Reference Lab, Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.'}]",Profile of Persons Recently Infected with HIV-1 in Belgium: New Insights to Tailor Prevention Efforts.
"Identifying determinants of longitudinal HIV viral load (VL) trajectories using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) can inform clinical strategies and mechanisms of nonadherence among children.
Children under 12 months old who were newly diagnosed with HIV were enrolled in the Optimizing Pediatric HIV therapy cohort (NCT00428116) from 2007 to 2010. Children initiated antiretroviral therapy at enrollment, and VL was assessed every 3 months for 24 months post-antiretroviral therapy and every 6 months thereafter up to 8 years old. VL trajectory groups were defined using GBTM. Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine the correlates of each trajectory group compared with the sustained-low VL group.
Five VL trajectory groups were identified among 89 children with 522 VL visits from 6 to 24 months: sustained-low (63% of children), sustained-very-high (16%), sustained-high (9%), low-to-high (7%), and high-with-periods-of-low (6%). Children in the sustained-high group were more frequently on a first-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen (63% vs 38%; P = 0.03) and had younger caregivers (median: 22 vs 28 years; P = 0.02). Among 54 children with 560 VL visits followed from 48 to 96 months, 5 trajectory groups were identified: sustained-low (74%), mid-range (4%), periods-of-low (7%), high-to-low (7%), and sustained-high (7%). Those in the high-to-low group had younger caregivers (21 vs 29 years; P = 0.01).
GBTM identified unique VL patterns among children with unsuppressed VL. Caregiver and regimen-related characteristics were associated with patterns of nonsuppression. Younger caregivers may benefit from tailored counseling to help them support child antiretroviral therapy adherence. Palatable regimens are necessary for viral suppression among children with HIV.","Five VL trajectory groups were identified among 89 children with 522 VL visits from 6 to 24 months: sustained-low (63% of children), sustained-very-high (16%), sustained-high (9%), low-to-high (7%), and high-with-periods-of-low (6%).

"People with HIV-1 often have chronic inflammation leading to severe non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study A5314 sought to lower inflammation with low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX). The primary study outcomes were reported previously but here we present the impact of LDMTX on multiple measures of HIV-1 persistence.
A5314 was a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in 176 adult people with HIV-1 on virally suppressive antiretroviral therapy. LDMTX (5-15 mg/wk) was administered for 24 weeks with an additional 12 weeks of participant follow-up. The current analyses of HIV-1 persistence were restricted to 60 participants (30 LDMTX and 30 placebo) randomly selected from the total population. Plasma HIV-1 RNA, total HIV-1 DNA, and cell-associated HIV-1 RNA (CA HIV-1 RNA) were measured by sensitive quantitative PCR assays.
LDMTX treatment had no significant effect on sensitive measures of plasma HIV-1 RNA, HIV-1 DNA, CA HIV-1 RNA, or CA HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio at any time point or from baseline to week 24. As observed in the main study, absolute peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers decreased from baseline to week 24 among the 30 participants receiving LDMTX compared with placebo (median decrease of -31.5 CD4+ T cells/µL, -83.5 CD8+ T cells/µL).
LDMTX had no significant effect on any measure of HIV-1 persistence in plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further studies are needed to determine whether other immunosuppressive and/or immunoreductive interventions are safe and capable of affecting HIV-1 persistence.","LDMTX treatment had no significant effect on sensitive measures of plasma HIV-1 RNA, HIV-1 DNA, CA HIV-1 RNA, or CA HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio at any time point or from baseline to week 24.

"Antiretroviral therapy has revolutionized HIV treatment with didanosine (DDI) as a pioneering drug. However, DDI has been associated with retinal toxicity, characterized by peripheral chorioretinal degeneration with macular sparing. Despite its clinical recognition, the prevalence and risk factors for didanosine-induced retinopathy are not well described.
This retrospective case series analyzed 127 DDI-treated patients at Weill Cornell Medicine Department of Ophthalmology. Inclusion criteria included at least 6 months of DDI use and available ultra-widefield imaging. Patients were categorized as affected or unaffected based on retinal imaging assessed by two reviewers. The affected group was further divided into ""probable"" or ""possible"" retinopathy. Patient demographics, DDI usage characteristics, and imaging findings were analyzed with statistical comparisons drawn between affected and unaffected cohorts.
Of the 127 patients, 9 (7%) showed signs of didanosine-induced retinal toxicity. On average, the affected group was older compared with the unaffected group (65.1 vs. 56.5 years, P = 0.025), with lower BMI (23.2 vs. 27.4, P = 0.04), and older at the start of the treatment (51.6 vs. 40.8 years, P = 0.026). Mild phenotypes with peripheral pigmentary changes were also identified using ultra-widefield imaging.

"Globally, the majority of people living with HIV are women or girls, but they have been a minority of participants in clinical trials and observational studies of HIV. Despite this underrepresentation, differences in the pathogenesis of HIV have been observed between men and women, with contributions from both gender- and sex-based factors. These include differences in the risk of HIV acquisition, in viral load set point and immune activation in responses to viremia, and differences in HIV reservoir maintenance. These differences obligate adequate study in both males and females in order to optimize treatments, but also provide a powerful leverage point for delineating the mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis. The shifts in exposure to sex steroid hormones across a lifespan introduce additional complexity, which again can be used to focus on either genetic or hormonal influences as the driver of an outcome.

"Dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial communities, significantly impacts the health and functionality of the human genital tract, with profound implications for fertility and reproductive health. This review explores the intricate relationship between genital tract microbiota and reproductive outcomes, highlighting the composition and dynamics of these microbial communities in both females and males. In females, the vaginal microbiota, primarily dominated by Lactobacillus species, is essential for maintaining a healthy vaginal environment, preventing infections, and supporting reproductive functions. In males, the genital microbiota influences sperm quality and reproductive health. Dysbiosis in the genital tract, manifesting as bacterial vaginosis, yeast infections, urethritis, or prostatitis, disrupts these microbial communities, leading to adverse reproductive outcomes such as infertility, pregnancy, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections. This review delves into the mechanisms through which dysbiosis affects fertility, including alterations in vaginal pH, mucosal immunity, inflammation, sperm viability, and motility. It also evaluates diagnostic methods, clinical implications, and management strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, antifungal treatments, lifestyle interventions, and emerging therapeutic approaches. By understanding the microbial landscape of the genital tract and its impact on fertility, this review aims to inform targeted interventions that restore microbial balance and enhance reproductive health, ultimately improving fertility outcomes and the potential for healthy pregnancies.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ughade', 'firstname': 'Prachi A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND.'}, {'lastname': 'Shrivastava', 'firstname': 'Deepti', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudhari', 'firstname': 'Kamlesh', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education and Research, Wardha, IND.'}]",Navigating the Microbial Landscape: Understanding Dysbiosis in Human Genital Tracts and Its Impact on Fertility.
"Gastroschisis is a birth defect with the greatest risk among women <20 years of age.
Pregnant women attending the University of Utah's Maternal-Fetal Medicine Diagnostic Center between 2011 and 2017 for either their routine diagnostic ultrasound or referral were recruited (cases: pregnant women with fetal gastroschisis, n = 53 participated/57, 93%; controls: pregnant women without fetal abnormalities, n = 102 participated/120, 85%). A clinic coordinator consented and interviewed women and obtained a blood sample and prenatal medical records. We evaluated self-reported maternal characteristics, risk factors, and infections. To assess pathogen seropositivity we used Serimmune's Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis validated 35 pathogen panels and Chlamydia trachomatis and compared seropositivity to self-report and prenatal medical record screening to assess sensitivity.
Cases were more likely to report a younger age at sexual debut (p = <0.01), more sexual partners (p = 0.02), being unmarried (p < 0.01), changing partners between pregnancies (p = <0.01), smoking cigarettes (<0.01), and a recent sexually transmitted infection (STI) (p = 0.02). No differences were observed for self-report of illicit drug use or periconceptional urinary tract infections. Cases had a higher seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (p = 0.01). No differences were observed for herpes simplex I, II, or Epstein-Barr.

"Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), a sexually transmitted infection (STI), has emerged as a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis worldwide, with documented resistance to commonly used antibiotics including doxycycline and azithromycin. Data in Ghana regarding the prevalence of MG is limited.
This retrospective study investigated MG presence and macrolide resistance among patients who previously reported to selected clinics for STI symptoms between December 2012 and June 2020. Samples were screened for MG and mutations associated with azithromycin resistance were investigated using Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) including the Resistance Plus MG
A total of 1,015 samples were screened, out of which MG infection rate by TIB Molbiol and SpeeDx were 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. The mutation responsible for macrolide resistance was detected in one MG positive sample by both assays. Both diagnostic tests revealed no significant association between MG infection and socio-demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, gonorrhea, and chlamydia infection status. There was no significant difference in the mycoplasma percentage positivity rate detected using SpeeDx (3.4%) and TIB Molbiol (3.1%).

"Transgender women (TGWs) constitute one of the key populations for HIV prevention and control and constitute a high-risk group due to a lack of health services. The aim of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to HIV and knowledge access and needs amongst transgender women in Chongqing, China.
A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2022 to March 2023. A total of 128 self-identified TGWs were recruited in Chongqing, China, via snowball sampling, and a KAP-related questionnaire was completed via Questionnaire Star.
For the 128 TGWs surveyed effectively, the total knowledge of AIDS-related knowledge was 82.03%, with significant differences in age, education level, marital status, occupation and average monthly income (p < 0.05). Significant differences were obtained in terms of personal attitudes toward AIDS and place of domicile and literacy (p < 0.05) and subjective norms in terms of literacy (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of HIV-related practices. The corresponding values were assigned to knowledge, attitudes or practices. The total scores of the three aspects were 6.77 ± 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.89-9.65) (range: 0-8), 14.22 ± 2.37 (95% CI: 9.57-18.87) (range: 0-18) and 6.66 ± 1.79 (95% CI: 3.16-10.17) (range: 0-9), respectively. The main approaches for TGWs to acquire AIDS knowledge are 'Internet/smartphone' (81.68%), 'TV/radio' (49.62%) and 'special education on AIDS prevention in schools' (48.09%). TGW is more inclined to accept promotional activities such as 'WeChat push' (58.02%), 'peer education' (44.27%) and 'mobile app management' (37.40%). AIDS knowledge indicates that TGW needs to strengthen publicity, including 'transmission routes' (71.76%), 'voluntary counselling and testing knowledge' (67.94%) and 'virus-related knowledge' (64.89%).
First, the knowledge rate of AIDS amongst TGWs in Chongqing, China, still has room for improvement, and there is a gap between knowledge and behavior. Second, TGWs are tolerant of AIDS and people living with AIDS and have a strong awareness of AIDS prevention. Third, the health department should attach importance to the group of TGW over 35 years old, low-income, and low-educated, and promote social organizations and network platforms to further strengthen the health education and publicity of AIDS from the perspectives of knowledge acquisition and needs.","For the 128 TGWs surveyed effectively, the total knowledge of AIDS-related knowledge was 82.03%, with significant differences in age, education level, marital status, occupation and average monthly income (p < 0.05).

"In Burkina Faso, only 70% of people living with HIV knew their status in 2018, while the first 95 target of the UNAIDS suggests that by 2025 at least 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) know their HIV status. Female sex workers (FSW) are one of the most HIV-vulnerable groups, making it crucial to estimate the rate and associated factors of HIV testing among FSW.
We conducted a cross-sectional study focused on FSW in five main cities of Burkina Faso (Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou, Tenkodogo, and Ouahigouya). A respondent-driven sampling (RDS) approach was used to recruit participants. Data were collected through in-person interviews between June and August 2022. The HIV testing rate in the past twelve months was examined by sociodemographic characteristics and risky behaviors. A modified Poisson regression in a generalized estimating equation with an exchangeable correlation structure was used to explore the associated factors of HIV testing.
Of 1338 FSW (average age: 27.6 ± 7.25 years) HIV negative, 57.8% (95% CI: 54.2-61.3) reported having been tested for HIV in the last 12 months. Among those who started sex work before the age of 18, 48.0% (95% CI: 39.1-57.1) reported having been tested for HIV in the last 12 months. The HIV testing rate among FSWs within the last 12 months was independently associated with age, education level, and being member of an FSW supportive association. Indeed, FSW aged 25 years and more had a 14% higher rate of being tested for HIV within 12 months compared to those 15 to 24 years old (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 1.14 [95%CI: 1.05-1.24]). The HIV testing rate among those who are not members of an FSW supportive association was 16% lower (aPR: 0.84 [95%CI: 0.72-0.97]) than those who are members of FSW supportive associations.
The HIV testing rate among FSW is low in Burkina Faso, suggesting an important challenge to reach the first 95% target of UNAIDS among FSW. Innovative diagnostic strategies for the early identification of HIV-infected FSW are essential to achieve the first 95 target by 2025 in Burkina Faso.","Of 1338 FSW (average age: 27.6 ± 7.25 years) HIV negative, 57.8% (95% CI: 54.2-61.3) reported having been tested for HIV in the last 12 months.

DNA isolates were analyzed by PCR methods, including droplet digital PCR. The results demonstrate that (1) HPV16 DNA has been detected in one-third of the FT and tumor samples from EOCs; (2) the prevalence and quantity of HPV16 DNA were significantly higher in FT samples from HGSOCs, non-HGSOCs, and ovarian metastases than in those from non-neoplastic diseases; (3) CMV and EBV have been detected in approximately one-seventh of EOC samples.

"Both efavirenz and dolutegravir have been associated with neuropsychiatric side-effects and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV RNA escape has not been comprehensively studied in African populations. We aimed to examine changes in cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and CSF viral control associated with the widespread switch from efavirenz-based to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART).
This prospective cohort study of people with HIV and people without HIV recruited adults with HIV (aged 18-55 years) from the Gugulethu Community Health Centre in a low-income periurban area of Cape Town, South Africa. Eligible participants had been receiving efavirenz-based ART for at least 1 year and were identified by the clinic to switch to dolutegravir-based ART as part of the national programmatic switch. Participants were studied at baseline and followed up at 1 year after switch to dolutegravir. People without HIV were recruited from the same area, matched for age and gender, and followed up at the same time interval. People with HIV and people without HIV underwent comprehensive cognitive testing over seven domains and measures of functioning, mood, anxiety, and sleep. People with HIV had CSF sampling for HIV RNA quantification.
Between Aug 12, 2019, and Sept 16, 2022, we recruited 178 people with HIV and 95 people without HIV. 145 (81%) of 178 people with HIV and 40 (66%) of 60 people without HIV who were offered underwent follow-up. Global cognitive performance was 2·57 T score points lower in people with HIV than in people without HIV at baseline (p=0·0008). At follow-up, cognition in people with HIV improved more than practice effects observed in people without HIV (coefficient 1·40, 95% CI 0·48-2·32, p=0·0028) and no significant difference in cognitive performance between groups was apparent (51·43 vs 52·73; p=0·22). Sleep quality improved following the switch (risk ratio 0·90, 95% CI 0·84-0·95; p=0·0002), driven mainly by indicators of disturbed sleep. There were nine incident cases of depression, although baseline differences were present. There was one case (1%) of CSF escape at baseline and three cases (4%) at follow-up; all were at low levels or resolved with repeated sampling.
Improvements in cognition and sleep are probably related to switching from efavirenz. However, the possible increase in depression warrants further examination. Cognitive performance in virally supressed African people with HIV receiving dolutegravir-based therapy is similar to people without HIV. CSF escape is uncommon on both efavirenz-based and dolutegravir-based therapy.

"Background Aging women living with HIV are significantly affected by menopause and comorbidities, yet international and Australian HIV guidance on the management of women is scarce. This study aimed to identify gaps in clinical management of menopause, age-related comorbidities, and psychosocial health of women living with HIV attending our metropolitan sexual health service. Methods A clinical audit of all cisgender women who attended Sydney Local Health District Department of Sexual Health Medicine for ongoing routine HIV care between 1 January 2021 and 1 January 2023 was undertaken. Results Twenty-seven patient files were examined. Half (13/27, 48.1%) of women were age 45years and older, of whom 6/13 (46.2%) were postmenopausal and 4/13 (30.8%) did not have menopause status recorded. In the prior 12months, most women had their blood pressure (19/27, 70.4%), total cholesterol (21/27, 77.8%), glycated haemoglobin (21/27, 77.8%), estimated glomerular filtration rate (27/27, 96.3%), and liver function tests (26/27, 96.3%) measured. Smoking and alcohol intake was documented for less than half of women (13/27, 48.1%; and 12/27, 44.4%; respectively). In women aged 45years and older, absolute cardiovascular disease risk was calculated in 2/13 (15.4%), and none had a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score or cognitive screen performed in the prior 12months. One-fifth (5/27, 18.5%) had a documented history of depression or anxiety. Of those screened, half (4/8, 50.0%) disclosed past intimate partner violence.

"As a result of shared social and structural risk factors, people in households affected by tuberculosis may have an increased risk of chronic conditions; at the same time, tuberculosis screening may be an opportunity for interventions. We sought to describe the prevalence of HIV, nutritional disorders, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among members of tuberculosis-affected households in 3 African countries.
A part of a multicountry cohort study, we screened for tuberculosis, HIV, nutritional disorders (underweight, anaemia, overweight/obesity), and NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, and chronic lung disease) among members of tuberculosis-affected households aged ≥10 years in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. We describe the prevalence of these conditions, their co-occurence within individuals (multimorbidity) and household-level clustering. Of 2,109 household contacts recruited, 93% (n = 1,958, from 786 households) had complete data and were included in the analysis. Sixty-two percent were female, median age was 27 years, and 0.7% (n = 14) were diagnosed with co-prevalent tuberculosis. Six percent of household members (n = 120) had previous tuberculosis, 15% (n = 294) were living with HIV, 10% (n = 194) had chronic lung disease, and 18% (n = 347) were anaemic. Nine percent of adults (n = 127) had diabetes by HbA1c criteria, 32% (n = 439) had hypertension. By body mass index criteria, 18% household members (n = 341) were underweight while 29% (n = 549) were overweight or obese. Almost half the household members (n = 658) had at least 1 modifiable tuberculosis risk factor. Sixty-one percent of adults (n = 822) had at least 1 chronic condition, 1 in 4 had multimorbidity. While most people with HIV knew their status and were on treatment, people with NCDs were usually undiagnosed and untreated. Limitations of this study include use of point-of-care HbA1c for definition of diabetes and definition of hypertension based on single-day measurements.
Households affected by tuberculosis also face multiple other health challenges. Integrated approaches to tuberculosis screening may represent an opportunity for identification and treatment, including prioritisation of individuals at highest risk for tuberculosis to receive preventive therapy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Calderwood', 'firstname': 'Claire Jacqueline', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.\nThe Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Marambire', 'firstname': 'Edson Tawanda', 'initials': 'ET', 'affiliation': 'The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.\nCIHLMU Center for International Health, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Larsson', 'firstname': 'Leyla', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.\nDivision of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Banze', 'firstname': 'Denise', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'CIHLMU Center for International Health, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.\nInstituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Marracuene, Mozambique.'}, {'lastname': 'Mfinanga', 'firstname': 'Alfred', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'CIHLMU Center for International Health, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.\nNational Institute for Medical Research-Mbeya Medical Research Centre, Mbeya, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Nhamuave', 'firstname': 'Celina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Marracuene, Mozambique.'}, {'lastname': 'Appalarowthu', 'firstname': 'Tejawsi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mugava', 'firstname': 'Mishelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribeiro', 'firstname': 'Jorge', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Marracuene, Mozambique.'}, {'lastname': 'Towo', 'firstname': 'Peter Edwin', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Medical Research-Mbeya Medical Research Centre, Mbeya, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Madziva', 'firstname': 'Karlos', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Dixon', 'firstname': 'Justin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Held', 'firstname': 'Kathrin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Germany.\nFraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Immunology, Infection and Pandemic Research, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Minja', 'firstname': 'Lilian Tina', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Medical Research-Mbeya Medical Research Centre, Mbeya, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Mutsvangwa', 'firstname': 'Junior', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Khosa', 'firstname': 'Celso', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Nacional de Saúde (INS), Marracuene, Mozambique.'}, {'lastname': 'Heinrich', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Germany.\nFraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Immunology, Infection and Pandemic Research, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fielding', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'TB Centre, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Kranzer', 'firstname': 'Katharina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.\nThe Health Research Unit Zimbabwe, Biomedical Research and Training Institute, Harare, Zimbabwe.\nDivision of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]","HIV, malnutrition, and noncommunicable disease epidemics among tuberculosis-affected households in east and southern Africa: A cross-sectional analysis of the ERASE-TB cohort."
"In the US, gaps in health care insurance coverage correlate with lower use of preventive care. We aimed to determine whether part-year or year-round uninsurance was associated with lower use of testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
We identified women age 19-49 in the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Completion of any STI testing in the past year, and location of STI testing, were regressed on pattern of insurance coverage, classified as continuous private, continuous public, part-year uninsured, or year-round uninsured.
Based on the analytic sample (N = 4,119), 12% of women age 19-49 experienced part-year uninsurance, and 8% experienced year-round uninsurance; while 31% received an STI test in the past year. On multivariable analysis, respondents with part-year uninsurance were the group most likely to have received STI testing (odds ratio [OR] compared to continuous private coverage: 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 2.23; p = 0.015), whereas respondents with year-round uninsurance were the group least likely to receive STI testing (OR vs. continuous private coverage: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55; p < 0.001). Year-round uninsurance was associated with higher likelihood of receiving a test at locations other than public or private clinics, such as at a hospital or at an in-store clinic.
Low use of STI testing among women with year-round uninsurance indicates a need for expanded insurance coverage and greater access to STI testing. However, high rates of STI testing among women with part-year uninsurance challenge the presumed association of insurance continuity with higher uptake of preventive care.","Based on the analytic sample (N = 4,119), 12% of women age 19-49 experienced part-year uninsurance, and 8% experienced year-round uninsurance; while 31% received an STI test in the past year.

"With rising rates of syphilis in the United States, novel strategies are needed to improve early diagnosis, particularly among priority populations such as pregnant people. As the primary source of healthcare for many communities with limited access to care, the emergency department (ED) visit represents a crucial opportunity for syphilis detection and congenital syphilis prevention.
This pre-post design study examined all ED encounters for 2-year periods before and after implementation of an opt-out ED syphilis screening intervention in May 2019 at a large, urban, academic ED. Data on laboratory testing, syphilis status, and demographics were extracted from the medical record. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine trends in syphilis screening and diagnosis.
Syphilis screening increased from 5209 (3.6%) to 37 289 (24.4%) encounters. Presumed active syphilis infection (PAI) increased 288%, from 161 patients (3.1% of those screened) to 624 (1.7%). The proportion of female PAI increased from 25.6% to 42.5%, despite no change in proportion of females screened. Post-intervention, 23.6% of PAI were tested for a urogenital sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the ED and 9.0% presented with symptoms of an STI by diagnosis code. Among pregnant people, screening increased from 5.9% to 49.9% of encounters, and syphilis diagnosis increased 750%, from 2 cases to 15.
Opt-out ED syphilis screening led to a dramatic increase in screening and diagnosis, especially among pregnant individuals, a priority population for congenital syphilis prevention.

"Anogenital warts (AGW) are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly types 6 and 11. The highest incidence of AGW occurs in the age group of 15-24 years. However, as life expectancy increases, there is a significant rise in the geriatric population worldwide. This demographic shift is directly proportional to the increasing number of STIs cases within the geriatric group.
A case of AGW was reported in a 75-year-old man who had a history of erectile dysfunction medication use and recent sexual contact. During the physical examination, a hyperpigmented plaque with a verrucous surface was observed at the base of the penis. The results of the histopathological examination were consistent with the characteristics of AGW. In addition, HPV genotyping, through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the presence of HPV type 6.
The aging process leads to a decline in immune function among geriatric individuals, which causes susceptibility to infections, including STIs. Moreover, the geriatric population has a different level of susceptibility to STIs compared to younger individuals. Factors such as physiological changes, decreased sexual function, low awareness of STIs, and having multiple sexual partners further increase the risk of STIs in this age group.
Sexual intercourse is an important component of the human life. However, the natural decline in sexual function due to the aging process often occurs with advancing age. As a result, many geriatrics seek various solutions in order to maintain sexual function and activity in old age. Since STIs can occur at any age, early detection and education are essential, particularly for the geriatric population.",,"[{'lastname': 'Achdiat', 'firstname': 'Pati Aji', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Atiyah', 'firstname': 'Dini', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yulianti', 'firstname': 'Fitri', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sutedja', 'firstname': 'Endang', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gondokaryono', 'firstname': 'Srie Prihianti', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Usman', 'firstname': 'Hermin Aminah', 'initials': 'HA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Maharani', 'firstname': 'Retno Hesty', 'initials': 'RH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran - Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.'}]",Anogenital Warts in Geriatrics: Immunosenescence and New Sexual Contacts?

A systematic review of seven databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane, JSTOR, Embase, Scopus, and EBSCO were identified, and 14 eligible randomized controlled trials published until June 2023 were included. Two independent authors assessed quality appraisal using the Risk of Bias 2.0. Outcomes were measured using the standard mean difference (SMD) with random effects model and a 95% confidence interval. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to explore heterogeneity. The results showed significant improvements in participants' knowledge (SMD: 1.13, 95%CI: 0.78-1.49), behavior intentions (SMD: 1.22, 95%CI: 0.37-2.07), and attitude (SMD: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.02-0.95) after receiving HIV prevention education programs. Interventions grounded in theoretical principles and incorporating technology, group settings, and audio-visual aids were found to be effective in enhancing knowledge of HIV prevention and promoting behavioral intentions. Peer-led education positively impacted both knowledge and attitude. Moreover, excluding parents from these programs was identified as a crucial factor in improving adolescents' knowledge of HIV prevention.

"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection has evolved substantially. The development of long-acting drugs, such as cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) might improve treatment satisfaction among people living with HIV (PLWH). The real-world effectiveness of long-acting ART and its effect on patient satisfaction needs to be assessed. This study investigated antiviral effectiveness and treatment satisfaction in PLWH who switched from conventional to long-acting ART (CAB + RPV).
This prospective cohort study included PLWH aged 18 years and older who switched to CAB + RPV and received the injections every 8 weeks between June 2022 and May 2023, after a 4-week oral lead-in phase. The eligibility criteria included viral suppression, absence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and no prior RPV resistance mutations. Clinical data, including renal, lipid, and glucose biomarker levels, were monitored from the baseline to 44 weeks after switching. Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate changes in clinical data from baseline.
Thirty-eight male participants were enrolled. Some participants had detectable levels of viral replication; however, all participants maintained viral suppression (HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL) at 44 weeks and no cases of virological failure were detected.

"In China, the problem of HIV infection among the older people has become increasingly prominent. This study aimed to analyze the pattern and influencing factors of HIV transmission based on a genomic and spatial epidemiological analysis among this population.
A total of 432 older people who were aged ≥ 50 years, newly diagnosed with HIV-1 between January 2018 and December 2021 and without a history of ART were enrolled. HIV-1 pol gene sequence was obtained by viral RNA extraction and nested PCR. The molecular transmission network was constructed using HIV-TRACE and the spatial distribution analyses were performed in ArcGIS. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the factors associated with clustering.
A total of 382 sequences were successfully sequenced, of which CRF07_BC (52.3%), CRF01_AE (32.5%), and CRF08_BC (6.8%) were the main HIV-1 strains. A total of 176 sequences entered the molecular network, with a clustering rate of 46.1%. Impressively, the clustering rate among older people infected through commercial heterosexual contact was as high as 61.7% and three female sex workers (FSWs) were observed in the network. The individuals who were aged ≥ 60 years and transmitted the virus by commercial heterosexual contact had a higher clustering rate, while those who were retirees or engaged other occupations and with higher education degree were less likely to cluster. There was a positive spatial correlation of clustering rate (Global Moran I = 0.206, P < 0.001) at the town level and the highly aggregated regions were mainly distributed in rural area. We determined three large clusters which mainly spread in the intra-region of certain towns in rural areas. Notably, 54.5% of cases in large clusters were transmitted through commercial heterosexual contact.
Our joint analysis of molecular and spatial epidemiology effectively revealed the spatial aggregation of HIV transmission and highlighted that towns of high aggregation were mainly located in rural area. Also, we found vital role of commercial heterosexual contact in HIV transmission among older people. Therefore, health resources should be directed towards highly aggregated rural areas and prevention strategy should take critical persons as entry points.","A total of 382 sequences were successfully sequenced, of which CRF07_BC (52.3%), CRF01_AE (32.5%), and CRF08_BC (6.8%) were the main HIV-1 strains.

"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other (LGBTQ+) individuals face numerous health disparities, including higher rates of chronic diseases and sexually transmitted infections, partly due to marginalization, discrimination, and a healthcare system often unprepared to meet their specific needs. Despite the importance of vaccination in preventing these health issues, vaccination patterns in LGBTQ+ populations remain under-researched, with limited data available due to the absence of sexual orientation and gender identity information on most healthcare forms. As such, we sought to understand vaccine uptake among LGBTQ+ individuals living in New Jersey and New York for 7 primary adult vaccines.
Participants were 768 LGBTQ+ adults living in New Jersey and New York, US. We recruited this convenience sample through community centers and events, social media, and listservs of local professional organizations. The online survey examined uptake for 7 adult vaccines.
Of the 7 adult vaccines, human papilloma virus (HPV) had the lowest proportion of participants who were fully/partially vaccinated (54.4 %), followed by hepatitis A (59.8 %), hepatitis B (63.0 %), meningitis B (63.7 %), seasonal influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic (70.2 %), seasonal influenza before the COVID-19 pandemic (70.3 %), and nearly all participants (99.2 %) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. For Shingles virus, among participants age 50+, 63.8 % were fully/partially vaccinated. In adjusted models, age was the strongest predictor of vaccination uptake in HPV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningitis B, and seasonal influenza before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Younger participants were more likely to be vaccinated for 4 of the 6 vaccines, excluding Shingles (<0.001), whereas older adults were more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (<0.010).
This study highlights the differences in uptake across different vaccines. It also draws attention to differences within LGBTQ+ populations which is important to consider when ensuring more equitable vaccine access.","Of the 7 adult vaccines, human papilloma virus (HPV) had the lowest proportion of participants who were fully/partially vaccinated (54.4 %), followed by hepatitis A (59.8 %), hepatitis B (63.0 %), meningitis B (63.7 %), seasonal influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic (70.2 %), seasonal influenza before the COVID-19 pandemic (70.3 %), and nearly all participants (99.2 %) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. About 60% of HIV-positive individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) develop active TB. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recommended by the World Health Organization to prevent the progression of active TB in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, IPT implementation has been limited in some countries like Indonesia. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of IPT administration on the incidence of active TB in HIV patients with latent TB.
This was a quasi-experimental prospective cohort study conducted in an academic hospital in Indonesia. Interferon-gamma release assay-positive HIV-TB patients were randomly divided into an IPT group (received 6 months of IPT) and a non-IPT group. The incidence of active pulmonary TB was compared between the two groups after 6 months of follow-up.
Of the 23 eligible patients, 22 were enrolled (10 in the IPT group, 12 in the non-IPT group). The incidence of active pulmonary TB was 0% in both groups. Factors associated with the absence of TB in both groups were the use of antiretroviral therapy for >4 years and a CD4+ T lymphocyte count >200 cells/μL. IPT was found to be safe with minimal adverse effects.
In this setting, the use of long-term antiretroviral therapy and higher CD4+ counts, rather than just IPT, were the key factors associated with preventing active TB in latent HIV-TB patients. These findings suggest that comprehensive HIV management may be more important than IPT alone for TB control in PLWHA. Further research is needed to optimize TB prevention strategies in this high-risk population.","Of the 23 eligible patients, 22 were enrolled (10 in the IPT group, 12 in the non-IPT group).

This process is associated with increased levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and risk for AIDS development. Using mediation analysis framework, in this report we link the effects of unprotected receptive intercourse among MSM prior to primary HIV-1 infection to higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines sCD14 and sCD163 in plasma and a significant decrease in the abundance of A. muciniphila, B. caccae, B. fragilis, B. uniformis, Bacteroides spp., Butyricimonas spp., and Odoribacter spp., and a potential increase in the abundance of Dehalobacterium spp. and Methanobrevibacter spp. in stools of MSM with the highest number of sexual partners. These differences in microbiota, together with a reduction in the pairwise correlations among commensal and short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria with a number of sexual partners, support an increase in gut dysbiosis with the number of sexual partners.

Using a novel cgMLST-based genetic threshold, we demonstrate persistence of large N. gonorrhoeae genomic clusters over several years, with some persistent clusters associated with heterosexual transmission. We observed a decline in both N. gonorrhoeae transmission and genomic diversity during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggestive of an evolutionary bottleneck.

"Routinely obtaining a sexual history is a necessary first step to identify which patients have specific sexual behaviours that may put them at risk and use appropriate protective measures, especially in vulnerable populations. However, late diagnosis of HIV infection remains very high. Combination prevention strategies based on condom promotion, harm reduction programs for people who inject drugs plus PrEP and HIV PEP are the best options to prevent new infections. Screening for STIs (including hepatotropic viruses) and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the person since it improves the prognosis and complications and also for the community because it breaks the chain of transmission. People living with HIV who have an undetectable viral load do not transmit the virus sexually (undetectable=untransmittable).
La obtención rutinaria de una historia sexual es un primer paso necesario para identificar qué pacientes tienen comportamientos sexuales específicos que pueden ponerlos en riesgo y utilizar medidas de protección adecuadas sobre todo en poblaciones vulnerables. Sin embargo, el diagnóstico tardío de la infección por VIH sigue siendo muy elevado. Las estrategias de prevención combinada basadas en la promoción del preservativo, los programas de reducción de daños en las personas que se inyectan drogas (PID) más la profilaxis preexposición (PrEP) y la promoción de la profilaxis pos-exposición (PPE) del VIH son las mejores opciones para prevenir nuevas infecciones.

"Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is effective at preventing infection and certain types of cancer, uptake is suboptimal. HPV vaccine requirements for school entry are an underutilized strategy to increase HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents. The purpose of this study was to understand the factors that are predictive of parents' attitudes toward schools requiring the HPV vaccine for entry into middle school. Parents of adolescents ages 11-12 y were recruited to participate in an online survey via Qualtrics. Descriptive frequencies were obtained, and sequential regression analyses were conducted controlling for demographic characteristics. A total of 1,046 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age was 40.3 y (SD = 6.3) and the majority of participants were White (74.4%) and had some college education or higher (80.9%). Participant's gender, political affiliation, urban/rural setting, and education level were significantly associated with attitudes toward school entry requirements.

"The optimal treatment of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) is currently a subject of clinical research. This questionnaire study investigated current trends in the treatment of HPV-associated (HPV+) OPC in Slovakia with the incorporation of deintensification of oncological treatment into routine clinical practice outside of clinical trials. The Slovak Cooperative Head and Neck Cancer Group (SCHNCG) developed a questionnaire aimed at identifying trends in the oncological treatment of HPV+ OPC intended for all radiation oncology (RO) facilities in Slovakia. Specialists in the field of RO responded to general questions about the character of their individual institutions as well as to 4 theoretical clinical scenarios (case reports) regarding the treatment of HPV+ OPC, focusing primarily on the applied dose of radiotherapy (RT), the extent of target volumes, and the type of concurrent chemotherapy (CHT). The questionnaire study involved 35 RO specialists from 14 institutions in Slovakia. Regarding primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in T1N1M0 HPV+ OPC, 16 respondents (45.7%) would consider de-escalation of the RT dose to <70 Gy. In the case of postoperative RT in pT1pN1M0 HPV+ OPC with negative resection margins (R0) and absent extracapsular extension (ECE), 4 physicians (11.4%) would consider de-escalation of the RT dose to <60 Gy in the tumor bed area, while the majority of the treating specialists (n=19, 54.3%) would omit concurrent CHT. In the case of primary RT in elderly patient with T2N1M0 HPV+ OPC, the same number of physicians (n=16, 45.7%) would consider de-escalation of the RT dose to <70 Gy, and 14 respondents (40.0%) would completely omit CHT. In a high-risk patient with T2N3M0 HPV+ OPC with a complete response after 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy (iCHT), none of the respondents would indicate a reduction in the RT dose to the area of the original tumor and lymphadenopathy to <60 Gy. The doses and extent of irradiated volumes in the treatment of HPV+ OPC in Slovakia vary among different institutions. The tendency to de-escalate RT doses and reduce doses of concurrent systemic therapy in Slovakia is high and there was also an observed trend to reduce the extent of radiation treatment fields.",,"[{'lastname': 'Švajdová', 'firstname': 'Michaela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation and Clinical Oncology, Penta Hospitals, Rimavska Sobota, Slovakia.\nDepartment of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.\nDepartment of Radiation Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubinský', 'firstname': 'Pavol', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, East Slovakia Oncology Institute, Kosice, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeremić', 'firstname': 'Branislav', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vojtek', 'firstname': 'Vladimír', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, East Slovakia Oncology Institute, Kosice, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barilíková', 'firstname': 'Gabriela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, East Slovakia Oncology Institute, Kosice, Slovakia.'}, {'lastname': 'Selingerová', 'firstname': 'Iveta', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Research Center for Applied Molecular Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kazda', 'firstname': 'Tomáš', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.\nDepartment of Radiation Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.\nResearch Center for Applied Molecular Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic.'}]",Trends in the treatment of human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma in Slovakia.

"During the 1980s, college students in the United States helped to destigmatize the distribution and use of condoms. They shifted their aims from preventing unwanted pregnancy to stopping the spread of sexually transmitted infections including the newly identified acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two student-led initiatives to deliver condoms after hours at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the University of Texas at Austin show regional and temporal differences in sexual mores as awareness of AIDS increased. These male students adopted a non-pharmaceutical intervention to prevent pregnancy and disease in the context of increased marketing of Trojan® brand condoms. Interviews with co-founders reveal how the students grappled with backlash from family members and campus administrators less enthusiastic about their popularization of condoms. Co-founders described how media attention affected their college experiences and how condom companies changed campus culture. Overall, large non-pharmaceutical companies such as Trojan® and small condom-resellers such as those at Harvard and the University of Texas at Austin reshaped cultural norms around safe sex as awareness of AIDS grew between 1985 and 1987.",,"[{'lastname': 'Osseo-Asare', 'firstname': 'Abena Dove', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Austin, USA.'}]",Safe Sex and the Debate over Condoms on Campus in the 1980s: Sperm Busters at Harvard and Protection Connection at the University of Texas at Austin.
"Mohs micrographic surgery is the gold standard for treating many types of skin cancer, particularly skin cancers of high-risk areas such as the face, genitalia, and digits, due to its tissue-sparing technique and low recurrence rates. The use of Mohs micrographic surgery for human papilloma virus-associated cutaneous malignancies has yet to be explored in a systematic review. The authors sought to assess outcomes including recurrence rates of Mohs micrographic surgery for human papilloma virus-associated cutaneous malignancies. PubMed was searched for the use of Mohs micrographic surgery in types of human papilloma virus-associated cutaneous malignancies. After application of exclusion and inclusion criteria, 33 articles were included. 700 cases from 33 studies were included. Overall recurrence rate following Mohs micrographic surgery was 39/478 (8.2%) at a mean follow-up time of 51.5 months. Recurrence rate for nail unit/digit squamous cell carcinoma was 10/103 (9.7%) at mean follow-up of 47.6 months. Recurrence rate for penile squamous cell carcinoma was 15/181 (8.3%) at mean follow-up of 45.9 months. Recurrence rate for Bowen's disease in extragenital areas was 11/189 (5.9%) at mean follow-up of 59.7 months. Patients overall reported satisfactory functional and cosmetic results.

"Cytokines coordinate the intricate choreography of the immune system, directing cellular activities that mediate inflammation, pathogen defense, pathology and tissue repair. Within this spectrum, the anti-inflammatory prowess of interleukin-10 (IL-10) predominates in immune homeostasis. In normal pregnancy, the dynamic shift of IL-10 across trimesters maintains maternal immune tolerance ensuring fetal development and pregnancy success. Unravelling the dysregulation of IL-10 in pregnancy complications is vital, particularly in the heightened inflammatory condition of preeclampsia. Of note, a reduction in IL-10 levels contributes to endothelial dysfunction. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a complex interplay of IL-10 occurs, displaying a paradoxical paradigm of being immune-protective yet aiding viral persistence. Genetic variations in the IL-10 gene further modulate susceptibility to HIV infection and preeclampsia, albeit with nuanced effects across populations. This review outlines the conceptual framework underlying the role of IL-10 in the duality of normal pregnancy and preeclampsia together with HIV infection, thus highlighting its regulatory mechanisms and genetic influences.

"Viruses utilize host cells at all stages of their life cycle, from the transcription of genes and translation of viral proteins to the release of viral copies. The human immune system counteracts viruses through a variety of complex mechanisms, including both innate and adaptive components. Viruses have an ability to evade different components of the immune system and affect them, leading to disruption. This review covers contemporary knowledge about the virus-induced complex interplay of molecular interactions, including regulation of transcription and translation in host cells resulting in the modulation of immune system functions. Thorough investigation of molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that are involved in modulating of host immune response to viral infections can help to develop novel approaches for antiviral therapy. In this review, we consider new therapeutic approaches for antiviral treatment. Modern therapeutic strategies for the treatment and cure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are considered in detail because HIV is a unique example of a virus that leads to host T lymphocyte deregulation and significant modulation of the host immune response.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for 20% of new cancer cases and 10.5% of cancer-associated mortality in Portugal. Associated risk factors include advanced age, family history, genetic alterations, and race/ethnicity. However, the role of lifestyle factors is often underestimated. To explore health professionals' perceptions of PCa risk factors, a qualitative study with three focus groups (FG), with a total of twenty-one general practitioners and urologists, was conducted via videoconference between February and April 2023. Seven themes emerged, including general perceptions of PCa; PCa risk factors; nutritional impact; the role of physical activity; alcohol consumption and smoking; sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases roles in PCa; and screening, diagnosis, and treatment methods. Despite agreeing that healthy lifestyles could promote better PCa outcomes and quality of life, participants did not specify any lifestyle factors that could promote or prevent this disease, posing challenges to lifestyle changes, particularly among older adults. Non-invasive screening methods, such as biomarkers and alternative treatments, are crucial for future research.

"Intimate partner violence affects 20-30% of women in the United States. Disparities in routine cervical cancer surveillance have been demonstrated in certain populations, including victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). This study examined and assessed the acceptability of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) self-collection among individuals who have experienced IPV. We conducted an observational study using qualitative data collection and analysis. We interviewed individuals with a history of IPV and who currently reside in Oregon. This study identified key themes describing knowledge and attitudes towards cervical cancer screening for individuals who have experienced IPV. They include: guideline knowledge, prior office-based cervical cancer screening experience, barriers to cervical cancer screening, at-home hrHPV self-collection experience, and testing confidence. Participants experienced fewer barriers and expressed increased comfort and control with hrHPV self-collection process. Individuals with a history of IPV have lower rates of cervical cancer screening adherence and higher rates of cervical dysplasia and cancer than other populations. The patient-centered approach of hrHPV self-collection for cervical cancer screening can reduce barriers related to the pelvic exam and empower patients to reduce their risks of developing cervical cancer by enabling greater control of the testing process.",,"[{'lastname': 'Madding', 'firstname': 'Rachel A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Oregon Health & Sciences University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L466, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. madding@ohsu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Currier', 'firstname': 'Jessica J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yanit', 'firstname': 'Keenan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Oregon Health & Sciences University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L466, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hedges', 'firstname': 'Madeline', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bruegl', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Oregon Health & Sciences University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Rd, L466, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.'}]",HPV self-collection for cervical cancer screening among survivors of sexual trauma: a qualitative study.
"Elevated susceptibility to acute myocardial infarction and various cardiovascular diseases has been observed in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with the uninfected population, as demonstrated in numerous studies. The precise mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus infection heightens the risk of acute myocardial infarction remains elusive. The manifestation of acute coronary syndrome in young patients with human immunodeficiency virus may deviate from the typical, displaying distinct pathophysiological and clinical characteristics. The occurrence of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in young patients with human immunodeficiency virus poses diagnostic and treatment challenges.
We present the case of a 46-year-old African woman with no traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. She was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection 2 years prior to her current admission for chest pain. Her troponin levels were elevated, suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Although coronary angiography ruled out coronary artery stenosis, it revealed mild myocardial bridging in the left anterior descending artery. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed myocardial infarction, indicating a myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries with an apical thrombus in the left ventricle. Following medical treatment, the patient experienced resolution of chest pain and improvement in ST-segment elevation.
In young female patients without traditional risk factors, human immunodeficiency virus infection is a possible etiological factor for myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries. The likely pathophysiological pathway is superficial endothelial cell denudation as a result of chronic inflammation and immune activation.",,"[{'lastname': 'Boumaaz', 'firstname': 'Meriem', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Mohammed V Military Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco.'}, {'lastname': 'Faraj', 'firstname': 'Raid', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Mohammed V Military Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco. farajraid95@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Reggad', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Virology, Mohammed V Military Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco.'}, {'lastname': 'Lakhal', 'firstname': 'Zouhair', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Mohammed V Military Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco.'}, {'lastname': 'Asfalou', 'firstname': 'Iliyasse', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Mohammed V Military Hospital, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco.'}]",Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in a young seropositive woman with human immunodeficiency virus: a case report and review of the literature.
"Large-scale HIV genotype drug resistance study has not been conducted in Chongqing.
A retrospective study was conducted on people living with HIV(PLWH) who received HIV-1 genotype resistance testing at Chongqing Public Health Medical Center from May 2016 to June 2023. The HIV-1pol gene was amplified through RT-PCR and analyzed in terms of genotypic drug resistance.
Of the 3015 PLWH tested for HIV-1 drug resistance, 1405 (46.6%) were resistant to at least one antiviral drug. Among non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), 43.8% were resistant, compared to 29.5% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 3.4% for protease inhibitors (PIs). V179D/E and K103N/S were identified as the common mutation sites in the NNRTIs class of drugs, M184V/I and K65R/N were reported as the most common mutation sites in NRTIs, while thymidine analogue mutation (TAM) group was identified in 373 samples. L10FIV was the most common mutation in PIs. The dominant HIV-1 subtype was CRF07_BC.
The high prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in Chongqing underscores the imperative for rigorous surveillance of the local HIV epidemic.

"Over the last decade, India has had an alarming rise in injection of opioids across several cities. Although scale-up of public sector services for people who inject drugs (PWID) in India has occurred over decades, accessibility has been diminished by fragmented services across physical locations. To circumvent this barrier, and in alignment with the World Health Organization's guidelines to provide comprehensive care to key populations, Integrated Care Centers (ICCs) were established across 8 Indian cities as a public-private service delivery model for providing free single-venue services to PWID. ICCs have been very successful in expanding service availability and convenience for PWID generally. However, few studies from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have evaluated how well young PWID (defined as those ≤ 29 years of age) engage with single-venue service models like ICCs or specific services provided in such models. Young PWID are an important subpopulation in India, as they bear a disproportionate burden of new HIV infections because of greater risk and evidence of lower receipt of HIV testing and harm reduction services compared to older PWID. In this comment, we offer insights specific to young PWID drawn from multiple quantitative and qualitative studies examining the reach and effectiveness of ICCs, which may provide generalizable insights into limitations of services for young PWID more broadly in India and globally.
Our studies suggest that while ICCs have expanded service availability, particularly in cities with emerging injection drug use epidemics, population-level reach to foster initial engagement among young PWID can be optimized. Additionally, young PWID who do engage with ICCs experience gaps in substance use treatment receipt and retention, and experience barriers to receipt of ICC services that are distinct from those experienced by older PWID. Notably, HIV incidence among ICC clients is concentrated in young PWID. Finally, ICCs were not intended to reach adolescent PWID, and new services are needed for this subpopulation.
In addition to co-locating services, iterative optimization of models such as ICCs should incorporate youth-specific differentiated interventions and be accompanied by policy changes that are critical to improving the reach and effectiveness of harm reduction and HIV services among young PWID in India.",,"[{'lastname': 'Ganapathi', 'firstname': 'Lakshmi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Global Health, Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. lganapathi@mgh.harvard.edu.\nDivision of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. lganapathi@mgh.harvard.edu.\nHarvard Medical School, 25 Shattuck Street, Boston, MA, 02115, USA. lganapathi@mgh.harvard.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Srikrishnan', 'firstname': 'Aylur K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Y.R.

"Medical students, as future health-care providers (HCPs) play a significant role in shaping attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and should possess adequate knowledge of this infection. The study aim was to assess knowledge about HIV among medical students of the University of Zagreb School of Medicine, and to determine the level of discriminatory attitudes towards PLWHA.
We assessed knowledge about epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of HIV by using closed-ended and multiple-choice questions. Likert-scale questions were employed to determine attitudes towards PLWHA. Bivariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression was used to assess correlates of certain discriminatory attitudes.
561 medical students participated, with 46.7% attending preclinical courses. Overall, 42.1% of students think they received sufficient information on HIV/AIDS during elementary and high school education. Among clinical students, 42.6%, 20.8% and 11.8% estimated accurately transmission risk after a needle injury, unprotected vaginal, and anal intercourse, respectively. 66.8% of clinical students were aware that treatment can prevent AIDS, while 58.7% and 69.8% were familiar with the rationale of using pre-exposure (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In the multivariate analysis, individuals lacking infectology course attendance (aOR = 1.45; CI: 1.00-2.09) and those unaware of transmission routes (aOR = 1.49; CI: 1.06-2.09) showed higher odds of advocating HIV status disclosure compared to those who did not yet attend an infectology course. Students supporting extra protection for handling PLWHA bodily fluids were more likely to support refusal to treat PLWHA (aOR = 1.80; CI: 1.22-2.69) compared to those who did not support that opinion. Males were more inclined to state that they would refuse to treat PLWHA (aOR = 1.66; CI: 1.11-2.50) and disclose their HIV status (aOR = 1.62; CI: 1.17-2.27) than females. Overestimating needle injury transmission risk raised treatment refusal likelihood (aOR = 2.22; CI = 1.29-3.92) compared to those accurately informed of this risk.
Results indicate lack of knowledge of HIV transmission risks after specific exposures and about PrEP, PEP and treatment effectiveness. Gender and knowledge about HIV transmission risks influence students' attitudes towards PLWHA. Medical education should be focused on fostering correct attitudes and addressing stigma, which undermines prevention and treatment outcomes of PLWHA.","561 medical students participated, with 46.7% attending preclinical courses.

"HPV status in a subset of HNSCC is linked with distinct treatment outcomes. Present investigation aims to elucidate the distinct clinicopathological features of HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC and investigate their association with the HNSCC patient survival.
The total RNA of exosomes from HPV-positive (93VU147T) and HPV-negative (OCT-1) HNSCC cells was isolated, and the transcripts were estimated using Illumina HiSeq X. The expression of altered transcripts and their clinical relevance were further analyzed using publicly available cancer transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Transcriptomic analyses identified 3785 differentially exported transcripts (DETs) in HPV-positive exosomes compared to HPV-negative exosomes. DETs that regulate the protein machinery, cellular redox potential, and various neurological disorder-related pathways were over-represented in HPV-positive exosomes. TCGA database revealed the clinical relevance of altered transcripts. Among commonly exported abundant transcripts, SGK1 and MAD1L1 showed high expression, which has been correlated with poor survival in HNSCC patients. In the top 20 DETs of HPV-negative exosomes, high expression of FADS3, SGK3, and TESK2 correlated with poor survival of the HNSCC patients in the TCGA database.
Overall, our study demonstrates that HPV-positive and HPV-negative cells' exosomes carried differential transcripts cargo that may be related to pathways associated with neurological disorders. Additionally, the altered transcripts identified have clinical relevance, correlating with patient survival in HNSCC, thereby highlighting their potential as biomarkers and as therapeutic targets.","Transcriptomic analyses identified 3785 differentially exported transcripts (DETs) in HPV-positive exosomes compared to HPV-negative exosomes.

"In Ethiopia, there were an estimated 670,906 people living with the Human Immune Virus (HIV). Implementing an HIV test and treat strategy and rapid scale-up of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) provided health facilities increased the number of the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. In the same way, the expansion of viral load monitoring in these health facilities and poor adherence to ART increase the number of high-viral load (HVL) patients. To alleviate this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended EAC intervention for HVL patients. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the level of healthcare providers' adherence to the EAC intervention protocol and explore barriers and facilitators of the intervention in West Amhara, Northwest Ethiopia.
Descriptive cross-sectional study design with concurrent mixed-method evaluation was employed. The adherence dimension, with its sub-dimensions of content, coverage, frequency, and duration of the EAC intervention, was used with sixteen indicators. A total of 20 high-case-load public health facilities and 173 HVL patients were included in our study. Quantitative data was entered into Epi Info and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics are analyzed in terms of frequencies, percentages, variances, and means and presented as narrations, frequency tables, graphs, and charts. Qualitative data were transcribed, translated, coded, and analyzed thematically using Open Code version 4.0 software. The qualitative findings were used to triangulate the quantitative findings.
The average adherence level of health care providers (HCPs) to the EAC intervention protocol was 55.3%, from which content, coverage, frequency, and duration of the intervention contributed 70.3%, 86.3%, 36.9%, and 27.7%, respectively. Most of the intervention contents were delivered during the session, but none of the providers developed a patient adherence plan at the end of the session. All HVL patients were linked and enrolled in the EAC intervention. But only 6% of them were tested for repeat VL.
The average adherence level of HCPs to the EAC intervention protocol was very inadequate. The main gap identified was difficulties in completing the EAC intervention sessions based on schedules. Implementing adherence improvement strategies, assigning an adequate number of EAC providers in ART and Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinics, and allowing sufficient time during EAC sessions are important.",,"[{'lastname': 'Belete', 'firstname': 'Amare', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Gondar Branch Office, Amhara Regional Health Bureau, CDC project, Gondar, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Teshale', 'firstname': 'Getachew', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Systems and Policy, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia. getateshale1221@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Yalew', 'firstname': 'Andualem', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Systems and Policy, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Delie', 'firstname': 'Endalkachew', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Systems and Policy, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Getu', 'firstname': 'Gebrie', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Atnafu', 'firstname': 'Asmamaw', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Systems and Policy, Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia.'}]","Adherence of healthcare providers to Enhanced Adherence Counseling (EAC) intervention protocol in West Amhara Public Health Facilities, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023: mixed method evaluation."

"Loss to follow-up (LTFU) from Option B plus, a lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), irrespective of their clinical stage and CD4 count, threatens the elimination of vertical transmission of the virus from mothers to their infants. However, evidence on reasons for LTFU and resumption after LTFU to Option B plus care among women has been limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study explored why women were LTFU from the service and what made them resume or refuse resumption after LTFU in Ethiopia. An exploratory, descriptive qualitative study using 46 in-depth interviews was employed among purposely selected women who were lost from Option B plus care or resumed care after LTFU, health care providers, and mother support group (MSG) members working in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission unit. A thematic analysis using an inductive approach was used to analyze the data and build subthemes and themes. Open Code Version 4.03 software assists in data management, from open coding to developing themes and sub-themes. We found that low socioeconomic status, poor relationship with husband and/or family, lack of support from partners, family members, or government, HIV-related stigma, and discrimination, lack of awareness on HIV treatment and perceived drug side effects, religious belief, shortage of drug supply, inadequate service access, and fear of confidentiality breach by healthcare workers were major reasons for LTFU. Healthcare workers' dedication to tracing lost women, partner encouragement, and feeling sick prompted women to resume care after LTFU. This study highlighted financial burdens, partner violence, and societal and health service-related factors discouraged compliance to retention among women in Option B plus care in Ethiopia.

"The HIV-1 capsid is composed of capsid (CA) protein hexamers and pentamers (capsomers) that contain a central pore hypothesised to regulate capsid assembly and facilitate nucleotide import early during post-infection. These pore functions are mediated by two positively charged rings created by CA Arg-18 (R18) and Lys-25 (K25). Here we describe the forced evolution of viruses containing mutations in R18 and K25. Whilst R18 mutants fail to replicate, K25A viruses acquire compensating mutations that restore nearly wild-type replication fitness. These compensating mutations, which rescue reverse transcription and infection without reintroducing lost pore charges, map to three adaptation hot-spots located within and between capsomers. The second-site suppressor mutations act by restoring the formation of pentamers lost upon K25 mutation, enabling closed conical capsid assembly both in vitro and inside virions. These results indicate that there is no intrinsic requirement for K25 in either nucleotide import or capsid assembly.

"Globally, HIV infection remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite reducing new infections, the global response to advanced HIV disease (AHD) remains ineffective, leaving HIV epidemics a significant public health threat worldwide. In Ethiopia, evidence regarding AHD is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of AHD among newly diagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiating antiretroviral therapy in the Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia.
A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 29, 2023, to February 06, 2024, at health facilities providing HIV care in the Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia. A total of 427 PLHIV-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) were recruited for the study. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews using KoboCollect version 2.4 and analyzed using R version 4.3.3. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) model selection was used to evaluate and choose the best-fitting model to describe the relationship between AHD and predictors. Finally, variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were considered independent predictors in the multivariable regression analysis.
The study participants' mean (±SD) age was 31.3 (±8.7) years. The overall prevalence of AHD among newly diagnosed PLHIV-initiating ART was 34.4% (95% CI: 29.8%, 39.1%). Rural residence (AOR = 3.48, 95% CI: 2.24, 5.47), alcohol consumption (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.59, 3.90), and being identified through community-based index case testing (ICT) (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.51) were found to be independent predictors of AHD.
The prevalence of AHD among newly diagnosed individuals initiating ART was high. PLHIV who consume alcohol should receive detailed counseling on how it can negatively impact their progress with antiretroviral treatment. HIV testing should be enhanced in rural communities by strengthening community health campaigns. Furthermore, community-based index case testing should be strengthened for early identification of PLHIV.","The study participants' mean (±SD) age was 31.3 (±8.7) years.

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to differentiate mpox lesion images from other skin lesions seen in a sexual health clinic.
We used a data set with 2200 images, that included mpox and non-mpox lesions images, collected from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and web resources. We adopted deep learning approaches which involved 6 different deep learning architectures to train our AI models. We subsequently evaluated the performance of each model using a hold-out data set and an external validation data set to determine the optimal model for differentiating between mpox and non-mpox lesions.

"Almost 60% of transgender people in South Africa are living with HIV. Ending the HIV epidemic will require that transgender people successfully access HIV prevention and treatment. However, transgender people often avoid health services due to facility-based stigma and lack of availability of gender-affirming care. Transgender-specific differentiated service delivery (TG-DSD) may improve engagement and facilitate progress toward HIV elimination. Wits RHI, a renowned South African research institute, established 4 TG-DSD demonstration sites in 2019, with funding from the US Agency for International Development. These sites offer unique opportunities to evaluate the implementation of TG-DSD and test their effectiveness.
The Jabula Uzibone study seeks to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and cost of TG-DSD for viral suppression and prevention-effective adherence.
The Jabula Uzibone study collects baseline and 12-month observation checklists at 8 sites and 6 (12.5%) key informant interviews per site at 4 TG-DSD and 4 standard sites (n=48). We seek to enroll ≥600 transgender clients, 50% at TG-DSD and 50% at standard sites: 67% clients with HIV and 33% clients without HIV per site type. Participants complete interviewer-administered surveys quarterly, and blood is drawn at baseline and 12 months for HIV RNA levels among participants with HIV and tenofovir levels among participants on pre-exposure prophylaxis. A subset of 30 participants per site type will complete in-depth interviews at baseline and 12 months: 15 participants will be living with HIV and 15 participants will be HIV negative. Qualitative analyses will explore aspects of implementation; regression models will compare viral suppression and prevention-effective adherence by site type. Structural equation modeling will test for mediation by stigma and gender affirmation. Microcosting approaches will estimate the cost per service user served and per service user successfully treated at TG-DSD sites relative to standard sites, as well as the budget needed for a broader implementation of TG-DSD.
Funded by the US National Institutes of Mental Health in April 2022, the study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at University of Witwatersrand in June 2022 and the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board in June 2023. Enrollment began in January 2024. As of July 31, 2024, a total of 593 transgender participants have been enrolled: 348 are living with HIV and 245 are HIV negative. We anticipate baseline enrollment will be complete by August 31, 2024, and the final study visit will take place no later than August 2025.
Jabula Uzibone will provide data to inform HIV policies and practices in South Africa and generate the first evidence for implementation of TG-DSD in sub-Saharan Africa. Study findings may inform the use of TG-DSD strategies to increase care engagement and advance global progress toward HIV elimination goals.

"Sexually transmitted infections (STI) or sexually transmitted diseases (STD) can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and arthropods. The most frequent bacterial STIs include Chlamydia infections, syphilis and gonorrhea; viral STIs include herpes genitalis (herpes simplex virus 1 and 2), human papillomavirus (HPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An empathetic medical history taking in cases of a clinical suspicion can provide important information for adequate diagnostics. When an STI is detected, a complete screening for other STIs should be carried out. The STIs result in a wide variety of symptoms and it is often difficult to make a clear diagnosis to a certain pathogen based on the clinical symptoms. To avoid reinfections, it is recommended to also test recent sexual partners. For certain pathogens highly effective postexposure prophylaxis or preventive vaccinations are available.

"We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trends in chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) encounter rates within the Military Health System.
This cross-sectional study queried electronic health records of 18- to 44-year-old female active duty service members and dependents during the pre-pandemic period (January 2018-February 2020), pandemic period 1 (March 2020-March 2021), and pandemic period 2 (April 2021-April 2022). We calculated monthly chlamydia, gonorrhea, and PID encounter rates using ICD-10 codes. We used change point analysis for trends in encounter rates and Poisson regression for differences in rates by age, active duty status, military rank, TRICARE region, and pandemic period.
There were 36,102, 7,581, and 16,790 unique individuals with chlamydia, gonorrhea, and PID encounters, respectively, over the pre-pandemic and pandemic time frames. Chlamydia and gonorrhea encounter rates were highest in ages 18 to 19, in active duty service members, and junior enlisted compared to senior enlisted and officer sponsor rank. Chlamydia and gonorrhea encounter rates varied by TRICARE region. Chlamydia encounter rates were lower in both pandemic periods 1 and 2 compared to the pre-pandemic period, whereas gonorrhea encounter rates were lower only in pandemic period 2 compared to the pre-pandemic period. Trend analysis showed monthly chlamydia encounter rates did not significantly change from January 2018 through August 2020, and then decreased 2.4% monthly through the remainder of the study period (P < .05). Gonorrhea encounter rates did not significantly change from the beginning of the study period through February 2021 and then declined 1.9% monthly through the remainder of the study period (P < .05). Pelvic inflammatory disease encounter rates were highest in ages 18 to 19 and 20 to 24, in the TRICARE North region compared to the South region, in active duty service members compared to non-active duty, and in junior enlisted compared to senior enlisted and officer sponsor rank. Pelvic inflammatory disease encounter rates were lower in pandemic periods 1 and 2 compared to the pre-pandemic period. Pelvic inflammatory disease encounter rates declined 8.0% monthly from January 2020 through April 2020 (P < .05), followed by a 11.0% monthly increase from May 2020 through July 2020 (P < .05) and a 0.9% monthly decrease for the remainder of the study period (P < .05).
Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and PID encounter rates in the Military Health System all declined in the pandemic period. Pelvic inflammatory disease was most influenced by the pandemic onset as demonstrated by an immediate decline in encounter rates followed by an increase several months into the pandemic. Young age, active duty, and junior enlisted status were associated with higher chlamydia, and gonorrhea, and PID encounter rates over the pre-pandemic and pandemic time frames. Lower encounter rates during the pandemic may be related to decreased access to health care services, reduced screening for sexually transmitted infections, or changes in sexual behavior. The less profound decline in gonorrhea encounter rates likely reflects the more symptomatic nature of gonorrhea compared to chlamydia. TRICARE regional differences varied for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and PID encounters.","There were 36,102, 7,581, and 16,790 unique individuals with chlamydia, gonorrhea, and PID encounters, respectively, over the pre-pandemic and pandemic time frames.

"As Positive Masculinity (PM) Programmes continue to develop globally, it is important to examine their role in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) outcomes. This multi-country qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with community members, beneficiaries and implementers of PM programmes. The findings show that PM programmes are designed using a gender lens to make boys and men more aware and conscious of harmful masculinity traits and their effect on SRHR. The beneficiaries of the interventions report imbibing positive SRHR behaviours by being sexually responsible - upholding sexual rights, taking precautions against sexually transmitted Infections (STIs) and learning proper communication with their partners. They also report acting as vanguards of positive gender norms to their families and peers. Although there are challenges in implementing PM programmes, the results of the study suggest that interventions targeting boys and men hold promise for improving boys' and men's health behaviours and promoting gender equality in poor urban settings.
Alors que les programmes de masculinité positive (PM) continuent de se développer à l'échelle mondiale, il est important d'examiner leur rôle dans les résultats en matière de santé et de droits sexuels et reproductifs (SDSR).

"The African Journal of Reproductive Health is pleased to publish these compendiums of original research in this special edition that document new findings in adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights from the West and Central African region (WCA). While sub-Saharan Africa has some of the worst indicators of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in the world, the indicators are more daunting in the WCA region. To date, the WCA is recognized to have the highest rates of unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmissible infections, as well as the lowest contraceptive prevalence rates among adolescents worldwide.1 Despite the high rate of adverse adolescent reproductive health outcomes in WCA, there has been limited documentations of the socio-cultural and economic circumstances that perpetuate these adverse consequences. There have also been no purposefully designed interventions that provide strong scientific evidence for developing strategies to reverse the trend.

"The Monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak disproportionately affected sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. To understand community-level changes in sexual behavior, we surveyed individuals in a semi-urban area in Southern California.
Participants were recruited between October 2022 to April 2023, using palm cards, and geolocation-focused online advertisements on social media and dating apps. Eligible participants were male, ≥18 years, reported sex with men, residents of San Bernardino or Riverside counties, California, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-negative, currently not taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Descriptive analyses were performed. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Student's T-tests examined the association between group sex behaviors and demographics.
We enrolled 91 gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men with a median age of 35 years (range 18-70 years). Nearly half reported having participated in group sex in the past year. Overall, 48.9% of group sex participants reported changing their sexual behaviors to prevent Mpox transmission, with limiting the number of sex partners being the most reported prevention strategy (47.6%). To prevent Mpox infection, participants that engage in group sex reported limiting the number of sex partners (34.4%), using condoms for anal sex (16.7%), avoiding crowded social venues (14.3%), and asking partners about Mpox symptoms before sex (9.5%).

"Stigmatization of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) threatens provider-patient relationships and contributes to the underutilization of STI services. Media can shape public attitudes toward healthcare topics by perpetuating or reducing stigma. Given the high prevalence of STIs and the widespread consumption of media, it is essential for healthcare providers to be cognizant of factors influencing societal perceptions of STI symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study is a scoping review of popular films depicting STIs. Full-length English-language narrative films featuring characters with confirmed or suspected STIs were included. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the proportion of characters accurately portrayed with STI symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment.
The final analysis comprised 128 characters from 77 films, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most frequently featured STI (42 films, 54.5%). The overall accuracy across all four clinical variables of symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment was 87.4%. Transmission was the most depicted clinical variable, represented in 74 characters (57.8%). All four clinical variables were simultaneously depicted in only four (3.1%) characters, with two characters portraying all four clinical variables accurately. Death occurred in 39 characters (30.5%), with HIV accounting for the majority (82.1%).
Most films accurately portrayed STI clinical variables, including symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment. Rates of individual variable depiction were inconsistent, while death secondary to STIs was common. Understanding the portrayal of STIs in popular films can provide valuable insights for clinicians, enabling them to effectively address patient misconceptions and knowledge gaps.","The final analysis comprised 128 characters from 77 films, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most frequently featured STI (42 films, 54.5%).

"This study primarily aimed to investigate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and other common pathogens of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in spermatozoa of infertile men and their effects on semen parameters. These pathogens included Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, herpes simplex virus 2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 1951 men of infertile couples were recruited between 23 March 2023, and 17 May 2023, at the Department of Reproductive Medicine of The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province (Kunming, China). Multiplex polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis were used for HPV genotyping. Polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis were also used to detect the presence of other STIs. The overall prevalence of HPV infection was 12.4%. The top five prevalent HPV subtypes were types 56, 52, 43, 16, and 53 among those tested positive for HPV. Other common infections with high prevalence rates were Ureaplasma urealyticum (28.3%), Ureaplasma parvum (20.4%), and Enterococcus faecalis (9.5%). The prevalence rates of HPV coinfection with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, herpes simplex virus 2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus were 24.8%, 25.4%, 10.6%, 6.4%, 2.4%, 7.9%, 5.9%, 0.9%, and 1.3%, respectively. The semen volume and total sperm count were greatly decreased by HPV infection alone. Coinfection with HPV and Ureaplasma urealyticum significantly reduced sperm motility and viability.

"In the general population, primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is advocated for cervical cancer (CC) screening. HPV E6/E7 mRNA (Aptima HPV, AHPV) assays have garnered considerable traction due to their higher specificity when compared with HPV DNA assays. Here, we investigated age-specific primary AHPV screening assays and different triage strategies versus cytology to identify the best approach.
Between April 2018 and December 2021, we recruited female participants from 34 communities across Liaoning province and Qingdao City, China. Primary cervical screening protocols included liquid-based cytology (LBC) and AHPV assays, with females positive for any assays undergoing colposcopy. Genotyping (AHPV-GT) was conducted on all HPV-positive samples. Our primary outcomes were the identification of age-specific detection rates, colposcopy referral rates, and sensitivity and specificity values for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+). AHPV and different triage strategy performances were also examined across different age cohorts.
Our investigation included 9911 eligible females. Age-specific abnormal cytology rates were in the 6.1%-8.0% range, and were highest in 45-54-year olds. When compared with 35-44-or 45-54-year olds, HPV prevalence was highest in 55-64-year olds (12.2% or 11.6% vs.14.1%, P = 0.048 and P = 0.002, respectively). In 35-44-year olds, AHPV sensitivity for detecting HSIL+ was 96.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89.7-100) - significantly higher than LBC sensitivity (65.5 [95% CI: 48.3-82.8], P < 0.001). When compared with LBC, HSIL+ detection rates by AHPV-GT using reflex LBC triage increased by 31.5% (9.6‰ vs. 7.3‰), and colposcopy referral rates decreased by 16.4% (5.1% vs. 6.1%). In 45-54-year olds, HSIL+ detection rates for AHPV-GT using reflex LBC triage were lower than LBC rates (6.2‰ vs. 6.6‰). In 55-64-year olds, AHPV sensitivity (97.2 [95% CI: 91.7-100.0]) was higher than LBC sensitivity (66.7 [95% CI: 50.0-80.6], P = 0.003). The area under the curve (AUC) value was not significantly different between AHPV-GT with reflex LBC triage and LBC (0.845 [95% CI: 0.771-0.920] vs. 0.812 [95% CI: 0.734-0.891], P = 0.236).
Primary AHPV screening using different triage strategies were different across different age cohorts. Thus, AHPV may be an appropriate primary screening method for 35-44 and 55-64 year old females, while AHPV-GT with reflex LBC triage may be more apt for 35-44 year old females.","Our investigation included 9911 eligible females.

"This is a case of a 56-year-old transgender female with a history of HIV who presented to the emergency department with visual disturbances and bilateral papilledema. Initially, intracranial abnormalities were ruled out through imaging studies. However, a lumbar puncture later confirmed the presence of syphilis in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral syphilitic uveitis by a retina specialist. Treatment with intravenous and intramuscular penicillin led to significant improvement in her visual symptoms and resolution of optic nerve edema. This case underscores the importance of early screening for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in transgender patients living with HIV presenting with visual symptoms. The delayed syphilis screening and treatment in this patient highlight the impact of healthcare barriers on transgender individuals. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent serious complications, such as permanent vision loss. Healthcare providers must maintain a high index of suspicion for syphilis in HIV-positive patients with visual symptoms, irrespective of their cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count or viral load.

"Chlamydia and gonorrhea notifications are rapidly rising in men who have sex with men (MSM). Currently, there are limited data on the prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea across various anatomical sites. Our study aimed to explore the prevalence, association and changing trends of urethral and rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea among MSM in Guangdong Province, China.
We analyzed data among MSM attending sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics in the Guangdong governmental sentinel network between 2018 and 2022. Chi-square tests were used to compare the difference, Join-point regressions for analyzing changing trends, and multivariate logistic regressions for examining associated factors.
We included 4856 men in the analysis. Rectal chlamydia significantly increased from 13.8% to 26.4% over the past 5 years (average annual percentage change [AAPC] 19.2%, 95%CI 1.0-40.6, p = 0.043). After adjusting for covariates, chlamydia infection positively associated with main venue used to seek sexual partners (aOR = 2.31, 95%CI 1.17-4.55), having regular sexual partners in the past 6 months (aOR = 3.32, 95%CI 1.95-5.64), receiving HIV counselling and testing services (aOR = 2.94, 95%CI 1.67-5.17), receiving peer education (aOR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.14-2.83), infection with syphilis (aOR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.02-4.01) and infection with gonorrhea (aOR 7.04, 95% CI 3.01-16.48). Gonorrhea infection positively associated with having regular sexual partners in the past 6 months (aOR = 3.48.95%CI 1.16-10.49), and infection with chlamydia (aOR 7.03, 95% CI 2.99-16.51).

"Little is known about HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and uptake among adolescent and young men who have sex with men (AYMSM) in Vietnam. We conducted an online survey among AYMSM in Vietnam to determine the prevalence of HIV testing, PrEP awareness, uptake and their correlates. From December 2022-March 2023, 120 HIV-negative AYMSM from 15 to 19 years old in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam were recruited through peer referral to complete an online survey, which included questions on demographics, sexual behaviors, HIV risk perception and knowledge, HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, PrEP awareness and uptake. Separate multivariable models were used to determine the correlates of HIV testing, PrEP awareness and uptake. Only 58% of participants had ever been tested for HIV. The majority of participants had heard of PrEP before (82%), but only 36% had ever used PrEP. HIV knowledge (aPR (adjusted prevalence ratio) = 1.59; 95%CI:1.06-2.39), a history of STI testing (aPR = 1.32; 95%CI:1.06-1.64), having had anal sex with another man (aPR = 4.49; 95%CI:1.40-14.38) and lower HIV risk perception (aPR = 0.62; 95%CI:0.47-0.83) were associated with HIV testing. HIV knowledge (aPR = 1.38; 95%CI:1.06-1.78) and a history of STI testing (aPR = 1.16; 95%CI:1.03-1.32) were also associated with PrEP awareness. Higher HIV risk perception was negatively associated with PrEP use (aPR = 0.59; 95%CI:0.35-0.99). Our findings underscored the urgent need for further research to explore the causes of the gaps in HIV testing and PrEP use as well as to design innovative interventions tailored to the needs of AYMSM to support HIV testing and PrEP use.",,"[{'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Minh X', 'initials': 'MX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam. binhminh@live.unc.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Rutstein', 'firstname': 'Sarah E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, UNC School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffman', 'firstname': 'Irving', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, UNC School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Ha V', 'initials': 'HV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Behavior, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Giang', 'firstname': 'Le M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Hanoi Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam.'}, {'lastname': 'Go', 'firstname': 'Vivian F', 'initials': 'VF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Behavior, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}]",Low HIV Testing and PrEP Uptake of Adolescent and Young Men who have Sex with Men in Vietnam.
"Invasive cervical cancers (ICC), caused by HPV infections, have a heterogeneous molecular landscape. We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6 years prior to cancer diagnosis.

Codesign study.
Localities covered by two immunisation teams in London and the south-west of England.
The intervention planning phase involved combining evidence from a literature review with qualitative interview data to identify barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccine uptake, as well as design features that should be incorporated within the COMMUNICATE films. The intervention development phase involved identifying guiding principles for the COMMUNICATE films, mapping behaviour change techniques onto the behaviour change wheel and codesigning the COMMUNICATE films. Feedback from users informed modifications to maximise acceptability and feasibility and to support behaviour change.
The primary and secondary evidence highlighted important content to include within the COMMUNICATE films: emphasise the benefits of the HPV vaccine, provide transparent information about the safety profile and side effects and emphasise the universality and commonality of HPV infection. A series of scripts were used to guide 4 film shoots to create the content in multiple community languages with 16 participants, including vaccine-hesitant, ethnically diverse parents and professionals. Overall, participants were positive about the films. Potential messengers and ways the films could be distributed, identified by parents, include local social media networks or text messages from general practices. The need for information about the HPV vaccine to be shared by schools ahead of consent being sought was also raised.

"Anaemia is one of the most common problems in HIV-infected patients associated with increased HIV progression, decreased functional capacity, survival and quality of life. For better interventions, up-to-date information concerning anaemia among HIV-infected children less than 5 years of age on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is vital. Thus, this study aims to determine the predictors of anaemia among HIV-infected children less than 5 years of age receiving ART in North-West Ethiopia.

Amhara region Comprehensive Specialized Hospitals, North-West Ethiopia.
In total, we examined 460 HIV-infected children less than 5 years of age who had followed highly active antiretroviral treatment from 2010 to 2020.
The outcome measures were median time to detection of anaemia, the incidence and the effects of cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT), ART adherence, tuberculosis (TB), WHO clinical stage and wasting on anaemia.
The overall follow-up time was 9234 person-months of observation. The incidence density of anaemia was 8.34 per 1000 person-months of observation (95% CI 6.67 to 10.43). The cumulative survival probability of children after the last months of follow-up was 0.54. The independent predictors of anaemia were not receiving CPT (adjusted HR (AHR)=4.44; 95% CI 2.48 to 7.93), poor adherence to ART (AHR=2.46; 95% CI 1.37 to 4.42), TB (AHR=3.40; 95% CI 1.72 to 6.72), severe WHO clinical stage (AHR=3.03; 95% CI 1.40 to 6.58) and severe wasting (AHR=1.98; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.64).

"Sexual health is an integral part of well-being. However, the sexual health needs and desires of middle-aged and older adults have been largely disregarded. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the sexual health service preferences of adults aged 45 and older to improve the accessibility of sexual health services in the UK.
The formative stage of the discrete choice experiment (DCE) followed three steps: concept elicitation, refining and implementation. The attributes and levels were determined through 22 semistructured interviews during the concept elicitation, followed by pilot testing for refining the survey. Qualtrics XM, with conjoint project features, was implemented as the DCE survey platform. We used a random parameter logit model to estimate the relative importance (RI) of each attribute and preference for each attribute level. We also used a latent class model to explore groups of participants with similar preferences.
In total, 200 responses were included for analysis. The demographic breakdown included 62.5% females, 35.5% people with disabilities and 26.0% identifying as a sexual minority. The median age was 53. Preferences for using sexual health services were mainly influenced by the mode of delivery (RI 32%), location (RI 18%) and cost (RI 16%). Participants showed a preference for face-to-face interactions at sexual health clinics and displayed a willingness to pay for private services. Extra support and the consultation style played minor roles in their decision-making process. No differences in preferences were identified among disabled people. However, sexual minorities expressed their preferences for conventional messaging.
Our study revealed that middle-aged and older individuals prioritise sexual health services offering face-to-face consultations, emphasising a preference to attend sexual health clinics over cost. Aligning service delivery with these preferences has the potential to significantly improve the accessibility and uptake of sexual health services for adults aged 45 and older in the UK.","In total, 200 responses were included for analysis.

"The WHO (World Health Organization) conducted an elimination of cervical cancer program using triple pillar intervention strategy to target 90%-70%-90% of women before the year 2030, including (1) a full vaccination of HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to 90% of girls <15 years of age; (2) a high-performance screening procedure to 70% of women during the reproductive age (at the age of 35 and 45 years of age); and (3) an appropriate and adequate treatment to 90% of women with confirmed diagnosis of cervical lesions. Among the aforementioned three pillars, a full HPV vaccination has been introduced in our previous review, of which we have discussed the policy and strategy of HPV vaccination in the world and also reviewed the efficacy of HPV vaccination, with a successful reduction of over 90% of HPV-associated neoplasms. The aims of the current review will target another pillar-an appropriate and adequate treatment to 90% of women with confirmed diagnosis of cervical lesions. Since the early-stage cervical cancer has a favorable outcome and the treatment recommendation has been established, therefore, the current review focuses on women with persistent, recurrent and metastatic cervical cancers (advanced cervical cancers), which are still a biggest challenge based on its extremely worse outcomes before the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Integration of ICIs into conventional chemotherapy (paclitaxel-cisplatin) has become the new standard therapy for those patients with advanced cervical cancers. The recent clinical trials, such as KENOTE 826 and KENOTE A18 showing a dramatical improvement of both progression free survival and overall survival have approved the therapeutic efficacy of this combination as ICI plus paclitaxel-platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) with/without bevacizumab to women with persistent, recurrent and metastatic cervical cancers.",,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Szu-Ting', 'initials': 'ST', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Peng-Hui', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan; Female Cancer Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.

"The incidence of jejunogastric intussusception (JGI) after gastric surgery is 0.1%. We report a case of JGI after pancreaticoduodenectomy in a patient with HIV. After presenting to the hospital with abdominal pain and emesis, a CT abdomen/pelvis showed evidence of gastrojejunal anastomosis intussusception into the stomach. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, but endoscopic reduction was unsuccessful. Exploratory laparotomy was subsequently performed with a successful reduction of the intussusception and resection of a portion of the small bowel. With only five previously reported cases of JGI after pancreaticoduodenectomy, our case is novel in that it describes JGI in a patient with HIV on highly active antiretroviral therapy, which has been associated with an increased risk of intussusception.

"Differentiated service delivery models have been developed to accommodate the rising number of stable antiretroviral therapy clients and to maintain improvements in health outcomes and care retention. Ethiopia adopted the appointment spacing model and has had notable successes in implementing it. However, with the implementation of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing model in Ethiopia, little is known about the uptake and its associated factors. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the uptake and associated factors of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery model of care among stable clients on antiretroviral therapy in Southern Ethiopia.
A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 stable clients on antiretroviral therapy in southern Ethiopia from June 22 to September 29, 2023. A systematic sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Using a structured questionnaire, socio-demographic, health service delivery, behavioral, and clinical-related data were collected. The collected data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using Stata version 14. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in the multivariable logistic analysis were considered statistically significant. Multicollinearity and model fitness were checked using the variance inflation factor and the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit tests, respectively.
The uptake of the six multi-month scripting/appointment spacing differentiated service delivery model of care was 63.25% (95% confidence interval (CI): 58.61%, 67.88%). Missed appointment (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.91 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.25)), distance to antiretroviral therapy facility (AOR: 2.90 (95% CI: 1.67, 5.04)), duration on antiretroviral therapy (AOR: 2.21 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.64)), and intermediate social support (AOR: 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.17)) and strong social support (AOR: 2.71 (95% CI: 1.23, 5.97)) were factors significantly associated with the uptake.

"Ensuring good quality of life (QoL) among persons with diagnosed HIV (PWH) is a priority of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), which established 2025 goals for improving QoL. Goals are monitored through five indicators: self-rated health, unmet needs for mental health services, unemployment, hunger or food insecurity, and unstable housing or homelessness. Among the growing population of PWH aged ≥50 years, progress toward these goals has not been assessed. Data collected during the 2017-2022 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project, an annual complex sample survey of U.S. adults with diagnosed HIV, assessed progress toward NHAS 2025 QoL goals among PWH aged ≥50 years, overall and by age group. The recent estimated annual percentage change from baseline (2017 or 2018) to 2022 was calculated for each indicator. Among PWH aged ≥50 years, the 2025 goal of 95% PWH with good or better self-rated health is 46.2% higher than the 2022 estimate. The 2025 goals of a 50% reduction in the other indicators range from 26.3% to 56.3% lower than the 2022 estimates. Decreasing hunger or food insecurity by 50% among PWH aged ≥65 was the only goal met by 2022. If recent trends continue, other NHAS QoL 2025 goals are unlikely to be met. Multisectoral strategies to improve access to housing, employment, food, and mental health will be needed to meet NHAS 2025 goals for QoL among older PWH.",,"[{'lastname': 'Beer', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tie', 'firstname': 'Yunfeng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Crim', 'firstname': 'Stacy M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Weiser', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Taussig', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Craw', 'firstname': 'Jason A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Buchacz', 'firstname': 'Kate A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dobbs', 'firstname': 'Ashanté', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Collins', 'firstname': 'Charles B', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'Marie E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Los Reyes', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gelaude', 'firstname': 'Deborah', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Kamal', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Desamu-Thorpe', 'firstname': 'Rodel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Prejean', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]","Progress Toward Achieving National HIV/AIDS Strategy Goals for Quality of Life Among Persons Aged ≥50 Years with Diagnosed HIV - Medical Monitoring Project, United States, 2017-2023."
"In many parts of the world, men who have sex with men and transgender individuals face criminalization and discrimination. As a result, they are less likely to seek medical help, despite experiencing higher rates of HIV/AIDS, mental health issues, and other health problems. Reaching key populations (KPs) with essential testing, care, and treatment services can be challenging, as they often have a higher likelihood of contracting and spreading the virus. They have limited access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) services, which means that KPs may continue to serve as reservoirs for new HIV infections if they do not receive effective HIV programming. This ongoing issue complicates efforts to control the epidemic. Therefore, modeling a digital health system to track ARV medication access and use is crucial. This paper advocates for the use of digital interventions to manage the health of KPs in underserved regions, using Nigeria as a case study.
This study aims to assess digital health interventions for monitoring medication and consultations among transgender people in underserved communities. It also sought to determine whether a system exists that could support ART adherence in Nigeria. Additionally, the study evaluated design strategies to address privacy and confidentiality concerns, aiming to reduce nonadherence to ARV medications among KPs in Nigeria.
A qualitative approach was adopted for this research, involving a thematic analysis of information collected from interviews with clinicians and other health practitioners who work directly with these communities, as well as from an interactive (virtual) workshop.
The findings from the thematic analysis indicate a need to increase attendance at ART therapy sessions through the implementation of an intensive care web app. Unlike previous solutions, this study highlights the importance of incorporating a reminder feature that integrates with an in-app telemedicine consultancy platform. This platform would facilitate discussions about client challenges, such as adverse drug effects, counseling sessions with clinical psychologists, and the impact of identity discrimination on mental health. Other data-driven health needs identified in the study are unique drug request nodes, client-led viral load calculators, remote requests, and drug delivery features within the web app. Participants also emphasized the importance of monitoring medication compliance and incorporating user feedback mechanisms, such as ratings and encouragement symbols (eg, stars, checkmarks), to motivate adherence.
The study concludes that technology-driven solutions could enhance ART adherence and reduce HIV transmission among transgender people. It also recommends that local governments and international organizations collaborate and invest in health management services that prioritize health needs over identity.","The findings from the thematic analysis indicate a need to increase attendance at ART therapy sessions through the implementation of an intensive care web app. Unlike previous solutions, this study highlights the importance of incorporating a reminder feature that integrates with an in-app telemedicine consultancy platform.

"Sexually transmitted infections including gonorrhea and chlamydia are common in the active-duty military population, with historically higher rates than their civilian counterparts. Prevention and screening are 2 of the main strategies used to reduce the chronic medical complications and costs associated with untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia; however, there is little information in the literature regarding treatment time after a positive screening. To our knowledge, there has not yet been a study regarding delayed treatment of gonorrhea and chlamydia in the active-duty population.
We performed a population-based retrospective observational study on active-duty service members (ADSMs) diagnosed with gonorrhea and chlamydia from 2010-2019. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences in treatment times for key demographics. This study was reviewed and approved by the Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Average treatment time was 3.5 days for individuals with chlamydia and 5 days for those with gonorrhea. Treatment within 2 weeks was met for 94% of people diagnosed with chlamydia and 91% of people diagnosed with gonorrhea. Delay in treatment times for chlamydia were seen in men, ages 25-34, full-time active-duty service members, those with a history of prior infection, and soldiers in the Army. Gonorrhea treatment times were delayed in men, members of the Coast Guard, ages 35-44, and those with a history of prior infection.
Significant differences in treatment time were seen based on sex, age, branch of service, rank, and history of prior infection.","Average treatment time was 3.5 days for individuals with chlamydia and 5 days for those with gonorrhea.

Gonorrhea treatment times were delayed in men, members of the Coast Guard, ages 35-44, and those with a history of prior infection.","[{'lastname': 'Quackenbush', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'From the USAF Academy, Air Force Academy, CO.'}, {'lastname': 'Smalley', 'firstname': 'Joshua M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston.'}, {'lastname': 'Herbold', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health (San Antonio), San Antonio, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Landt', 'firstname': 'Cristy L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston.'}, {'lastname': 'Vance', 'firstname': 'Bryce A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'From the USAF Academy, Air Force Academy, CO.'}, {'lastname': 'Hansen', 'firstname': 'Shana L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston.'}]",Risk Factors for Delayed Treatment of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia in Active-Duty Service Members.
"Vaccine safety and immunogenicity data in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected (HEU) children are important for decision-making in HIV and typhoid co-endemic countries. In an open-label study, we recruited Malawian HEU and HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants aged 9 - 11 months. HEU participants were randomized to receive Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) at 9 months, Vi-TT at 15 months, or Vi-TT at 9 and 15 months. HUU participants received Vi-TT at 9 and 15 months. Safety outcomes included solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) and serious AEs (SAEs) within 7 days, 28 days, and 6 months of vaccination, respectively. Serum was collected before and at day 28 after each vaccination to measure anti-Vi IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cohort 1 (66 participants) enrollment began 02 December 2019, and follow-up was terminated before completion due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cohort 2 (100 participants) enrollment began 25 March 2020. Solicited AEs were mostly mild, with no significant differences between HEU and HUU participants or one- and two-dose groups. All six SAEs were unrelated to vaccination. Anti-Vi geometric mean titers (GMT) increased significantly from 4.1 to 4.6 ELISA units (EU)/mL at baseline to 2572.0 - 4117.6 EU/mL on day 28 post-vaccination, and similarly between HEU and HUU participants for both one- and two-dose schedules. All participants seroconverted (>4-fold increase in GMT) by the final study visit. Our findings of comparable safety and immunogenicity of Vi-TT in HUU and HEU children support country introductions with single-dose Vi-TT in HIV-endemic countries.",,"[{'lastname': 'Nampota-Nkomba', 'firstname': 'Nginache', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Blantyre Malaria Project, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.\nGraduate Program in Life Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyirenda', 'firstname': 'Osward M', 'initials': 'OM', 'affiliation': 'Blantyre Malaria Project, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Mapemba', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Blantyre Malaria Project, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Masonga', 'firstname': 'Rhoda', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Blantyre Malaria Project, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Priyanka D', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Misiri', 'firstname': 'Theresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Mwakiseghile', 'firstname': 'Felistas', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Wachepa', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Ndaferankhande', 'firstname': 'John M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Lipenga', 'firstname': 'Bright', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Pratiksha', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Banda', 'firstname': 'Happy', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Oshinsky', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasetti', 'firstname': 'Marcela F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Heyderman', 'firstname': 'Robert S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.\nDepartment of Infection, Division of Infectious Diseases, University College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jamka', 'firstname': 'Leslie P', 'initials': 'LP', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hosangadi', 'firstname': 'Divya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Life Sciences, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Datta', 'firstname': 'Shrimati', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gordon', 'firstname': 'Melita A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.\nMalawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Program, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Neuzil', 'firstname': 'Kathleen M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.\nFogarty International Center, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Laurens', 'firstname': 'Matthew B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}]",Single and two-dose typhoid conjugate vaccine safety and immunogenicity in HIV-exposed uninfected and HIV-unexposed uninfected Malawian children.

"Sexual behaviors, particularly risky sexual behavior, has become a serious public health concern among adolescents worldwide, presenting a substantial obstacle to the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is limited research using consistent and standardized methodology to examine associations between tobacco and alcohol use frequency and both total and risky sexual behaviors among adolescents. We aimed to examine the association between tobacco and/or alcohol use with both total and risky sexual behaviors among adolescents worldwide.
Data were collected from the Global School-based Student Health Survey, which comprised 211,847 adolescents aged 12-17 years from 59 countries. The frequency of tobacco or alcohol use during the past 30 days was categorized as 0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-9, or ≥ 10 days. Tobacco and alcohol use were also categorized as non-use, tobacco use alone, alcohol use alone, and combined use. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to examine both the independent and combined associations of tobacco and alcohol use with total and risky sexual behaviors.
Compared with no tobacco use, the odds ratio of engaging in sexual intercourse increased with the frequency of tobacco use from 1 to 2 days to ≥ 10 days (total: 2.03 [95% confidence interval 1.47-2.81] to 3.98[2.63-6.03]; risky: 2.43[1.75-3.38] to 4.21[3.26-5.42]), as well as with the frequency of alcohol use. Overall, combined users had greater likelihood of both total and risky sexual behaviors than tobacco users alone, alcohol users alone, and non-users. Similarly, the association between risky sexual behaviors and tobacco use alone was more pronounced among adolescent girls (vs. adolescent boys), as were those of risky sexual behaviors with alcohol use alone among younger adolescents aged 12-14 years (vs. aged 15-17 years) and with tobacco and/or alcohol use among adolescents in the Western Pacific region (vs. Regions of Africa and Americas).
Our findings suggest independent and combined associations between tobacco and/or alcohol use with sexual behaviors among adolescents, with variations across age, sex, and WHO region.","Compared with no tobacco use, the odds ratio of engaging in sexual intercourse increased with the frequency of tobacco use from 1 to 2 days to ≥ 10 days (total: 2.03 [95% confidence interval 1.47-2.81] to 3.98[2.63-6.03]; risky: 2.43[1.75-3.38] to 4.21[3.26-5.42]), as well as with the frequency of alcohol use.

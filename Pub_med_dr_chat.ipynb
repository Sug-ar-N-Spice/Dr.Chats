We assessed a tissue-free assay (Guardant Reveal) that bioinformatically evaluates >20,000 epigenomic regions for ctDNA detection in 1,977 longitudinally collected postoperative plasma samples from 342 patients with resected colorectal cancer. We observed sensitive and specific detection of minimal/molecular residual disease associated with clinically meaningful differences in recurrence-free intervals at each time point evaluated with a median lead time of 5.3 months. The longitudinal sensitivity in stage II or higher colon cancer was 81%. Sensitivity increased with serial measurement and varied by recurrence site: higher for liver (100%) versus lung (53%) and peritoneal (40%). Sensitivity among patients with rectal cancer was 60% owing to a high proportion of lung metastases. Specificity was 98.2% among 1,461 posttreatment samples (99.1% among those with follow-up longer than the upper IQR of the lead time observed in this study). Our data demonstrate the potential clinical utility of ctDNA as a tool to improve the management of stage II and higher colorectal cancer with a methodology that is noninvasive, accessible, and allows for rapid evaluation to inform clinical decisions.\",\n          \"Antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a major threat to global health, exacerbated by the misuse of antibiotics. In hospital practice, results of bacterial cultures and antibiograms can take several days. Meanwhile, prescribing an empirical antimicrobial treatment is challenging, as clinicians must balance the antibiotic spectrum against the expected probability of susceptibility. We present here a proof of concept study of a machine learning-based system that predicts the probability of antimicrobial susceptibility and explains the contribution of the different cofactors in hospitalized patients, at four different stages prior to the antibiogram (sampling, direct examination, positive culture, and species identification), using only historical bacterial ecology data that can be easily collected from any laboratory information system (LIS) without GDPR restrictions once the data have been anonymised. A comparative analysis of different state-of-the-art machine learning and probabilistic methods was performed using 44,026 instances over 7 years from the H\\u00f4pital Europ\\u00e9en Marseille, France. Our results show that multilayer dense neural networks and Bayesian models are suitable for early prediction of antibiotic susceptibility, with AUROCs reaching 0.88 at the positive culture stage and 0.92 at the species identification stage, and even 0.82 and 0.92, respectively, for the least frequent situations. Perspectives and potential clinical applications of the system are discussed.\",\n          \"Chronic wounds are a growing concern due to aging populations, sedentary lifestyles and increasing rates of obesity and chronic diseases. The impact of such wounds is felt worldwide, posing a considerable clinical, environmental and socioeconomic challenge and impacting the quality of life. The increasing complexity of care requires a holistic approach, along with extensive knowledge and skills. The challenge experienced by health\\u2010care professionals is particularly significant for newly graduate nurses, who face a gap between theory and practice. Digital tools, such as mobile applications, can support wound care by facilitating more precise assessments, early treatment, complication prevention and better outcomes. They also aid in clinical decision\\u2010making and improve healthcare delivery in remote areas. Several mobile applications have emerged to enhance wound care. However, there are no applications dedicated to newly graduate nurses. The aim of this study was to co\\u2010create and evaluate an algorithm for the development of a wound care mobile application supporting clinical decisions for new graduate nurses. The development of this mobile application is envisioned to improve knowledge application and facilitate evidence\\u2010based practice. This study is part of a multiphase project that adopted a pragmatic epistemological approach, using the \\u2018Knowledge\\u2010to\\u2010Action\\u2019 conceptual model and Duchscher's Stages of Transition Theory. Following a scoping review, an expert consensus, and stakeholder meetings, this study was pursued through a sequential exploratory mixed methods design carried out in two phases. In the initial phase, 21 participants engaged in semi\\u2010structured focus groups to explore their needs regarding clinical decision support in wound care, explore their perceptions of the future mobile application's content and identify and categorize essential components. Through descriptive analysis, five overarching themes emerged, serving as guiding principles for conceptual data model development and refinement. These findings confirmed the significance of integrating a comprehensive glossary complemented by photos, ensuring compatibility between the mobile application and existing documentation systems, and providing quick access to information to avoid burdening work routines. Subsequently, the algorithm was created from the qualitative data collected. The second phase involved presenting an online SurveyMonkey\\u00ae questionnaire to 34 participants who were not part of the initial phase to quantitatively measure the usability of this algorithm among future users. This phase revealed very positive feedback regarding the usability [score of 6.33 (\\u00b10.19) on a scale of 1\\u20137], which reinforces its quality. The technology maturation process can now continue with the development of a prototype and subsequent validation in a laboratory setting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 338,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Terry first reported retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in 1942 [ ROP is a growing problem in low- and middle-income countries, in settings where neonatal care has improved enough for increased survival, but is insufficiently developed to prevent ROP with poor oxygen control and a lack of screening and treatment programs [ The retina is part of the central nervous system, and any stage of ROP is associated with reduced brain volumes at term-equivalent age and poorer neurodevelopment at 2 years of age [ Laser therapy for ROP requires general anesthesia more often and for a longer time than anti-VEGF injections, with an increased risk to fragile preterm infants. Laser ablation destroys the peripheral retina and reduces the release of angiogenic factors. The alternative treatments, intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, are effective in suppressing neovascularization but suppress VEGF systemically for prolonged periods with poorly known long-term systemic consequences. The large variation in the incidence and severity of ROP in different countries and settings, depending on the quality of care, shows that ROP is largely preventable. In addition, one might speculate that ROP preventive measures may also promote general health and brain development. This narrative review focuses on recent achievements in the prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment of ROP. PubMed was searched for relevant papers published up to March 2024 using the search terms retinopathy of prematurity, prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment. Fetal retinal vascularization occurs from the optic nerve head to the periphery, guided by a circular moving wave of O Establishing an internationally recognized classification system for ROP severity allows the evaluation of incidence and interventions in all settings. The most recent international ROP classification was published in 2021 [ Several risk factors are associated with ROP. Immaturity with low GA, low birth weight, and oxygen supplementation are major risk factors. Poor early neonatal weight gain and low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are strongly associated risk factors often used in ROP prediction [ Oxygen supplementation is life-saving for extremely preterm infants, but is also a risk factor for ROP. After preterm birth, \\u201cphysiological hypoxia\\u201d of the peripheral retina is replaced by relative hyperoxia with oxygen supplementation, which varies. Intermittent apnea also contributes to fluctuating oxygenation, which is particularly detrimental to the development of retinal blood vessels [ The Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective Meta-analysis Collaboration compared a constant oxygen saturation (SpO Evidence suggests that targeting lower SpO Most extremely preterm infants become anemic and receive one or more transfusions of adult erythrocytes. Adult hemoglobin (HbA) has a lower oxygen affinity than fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and appears to deliver more oxygen to the brain [ A low HbF fraction is an independent risk factor [ Studies on the effects of nutritional intervention in preterm infants have mainly addressed neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, according to a meta-analysis, initiating parenteral lipids (\\u22651.5 g/kg/day within the first 24 h of birth) has a favorable effect on ROP compared to lower initial doses and/or later initiation [ Mothers\\u2019 own milk (MOM) is the best choice for all infants and is superior to donor human milk (DHM) in promoting growth and development. Ethical concerns preclude randomized trials comparing MOM and DHM. However, a randomized trial of 243 infants with GA <30 weeks compared DHM and preterm formula as substitutes for MOM when the supply was insufficient. A group of infants who received only MOM was also included. Of those fed exclusively MOM, 5.6% developed proliferative ROP stage 3 versus 19% fed DHM in addition to MOM versus 14% in the preterm formula-supplemented group, suggesting a protective effect of MOM against severe ROP [ The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is essential for brain and retinal development and accumulates in the fetus from approximately 30 weeks of GA. The supply is dependent on maternal intake. The role of the omega-6 LCPUFA arachidonic acid (ArA) in neurodevelopment and ROP has received little attention. ArA is constantly supplied to the fetus during gestation. It is enriched in the immune system and vasculature and plays essential roles in vascularizing neuronal tissues [ Supplementation of fatty acids in preterm infants has mainly comprised omega-3 LCPUFA in various forms. In a mouse model of ROP, omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation reduced pathologic neovascularization [ In the Mega Donna Mega trial, infants born with GA <28 weeks were randomized to receive enteral ArA (100 mg/kg/day) plus DHA (50 mg/kg/day) or no supplementation from within 3 days after birth until 40 weeks PMA. The supplement reduced severe ROP by 50% [ Some clinical studies have reported an association between neonatal hyperglycemia and ROP [ Experimental evidence suggests that the nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol may downregulate VEGF, IGF-1 mRNA, and HIF-1\\u03b1 in hypoxic retina [ Screening for ROP involves repeated, often painful, and stressful retinal examinations using intense light and dilated pupils. In Sweden, only 5.6% of screened infants required treatment in 2021 [ However, the infants\\u2019 weights are not always readily available to ophthalmologists. Therefore, DIGIROP-birth was created based on birth characteristics GA, BW, sex, and postnatal age in 7,609 infants born at GA 24\\u201330 weeks and registered in the Swedish National Registry for ROP (SWEDROP) [ With the increasing number of infants at risk for severe ROP, the burden of ROP screening and treatment has increased, and the availability of specially trained ophthalmologists is poor, especially in low-resource settings. Telemedicine, with bedside wide-field retinal photography and the transfer of images to a specialist for ROP grading, has proven to be a safe and cost-effective complement to ophthalmoscopy [ Laser photocoagulation of the avascular retina to halt the production of angiogenic factors such as VEGF has long been the most common treatment for sight-threatening ROP. Over the last decade, the use of easily administered intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents has increased worldwide. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared laser treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (BEAT-ROP trial) [ Anti-VEGF agents are valuable alternatives to lasers for the treatment of ROP. They are easily administered and are efficient. However, they leak into the circulation and suppress systemic VEGF levels, which have unknown effects on developing tissues including the brain. Bevacizumab remains in the circulation and suppresses VEGF levels for 2 months. The most common dose is 0.625 mg per intravitreal injection; however, lower doses may be as efficient. Bevacizumab doses as low as 0.002 mg were associated with reduced circulating VEGF levels during the first 4 weeks after treatment. Further studies on doses and long-term consequences are needed. The prolonged period of recurrence risk implies the need for detailed retinal examinations at ages when examinations have become a challenge, and sedation or general anesthesia is often needed. Laser therapy requires general anesthesia more frequently than anti-VEGF treatment, requires considerable skill, and requires more time. Laser therapy will continue to be a valuable therapy for severe ROP as a primary treatment, for the treatment of recurrences after anti-VEGF therapy as rescue therapy, and to reduce the need for intensive follow-up. ROP increasingly affects infants born during the second trimester of pregnancy and/or in less developed settings lacking oxygen monitoring, as well as programs for ROP screening and treatment. Screening examinations are painful, and laser treatment is destructive. ROP would not occur if preterm births could be prevented.

A 28-question survey was distributed to approximately 400 Egyptian physicians at the Egyptian Congress of Pediatric Pulmonology and through physician WhatsApp groups over a period of 3 months. The survey was adopted from an already validated survey that was used to evaluate CF knowledge in Eastern Europe ( The survey was available for 3 months, and two reminders were sent to the WhatsApp group. The majority of survey participants were \\u2a7d40\\u2009years old (69%), female (67.3%), and practiced in a university setting (69.9%) as specialists (83.2%). More than half of the participants reported seeing PwCF only when they were sick. Fifty-six percent of participants reported working at a hospital setting that has established CF guidelines that were adapted from the CF Foundation guidelines and modified based on resource availability in Egypt ( Demographic distribution of questionnaire participants Variations in resource accessibility among participants Data are given as  On the survey\\u2019s knowledge-assessment portion, the percentage of correct answers was 67.3%\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200913.4%. CF gastrointestinal manifestations and diagnostics were among the most missed answers. Chronic abdominal pain, rectal prolapse, and fecal elastase levels as a diagnostic tool were missed by 69.6%, 77.7%, and 64.6% of survey participants, respectively. Participants in private or university settings scored significantly higher than those working at other settings, with the majority being employed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) ( The findings of this study identify areas for educational and clinical improvement in CF care in Egypt. Previous targeted trainings for academic physicians by our team have made modest gains, yet there remains a considerable gap in CF knowledge. Future educational endeavors must concentrate on expanding CF knowledge beyond the academic setting. Notably, most participants failed to identify the gastrointestinal manifestations and complications of CF. This knowledge gap is likely due to reduced emphasis on diverse CF presentations in formal physician education. This is further supported by our finding that recently graduated physicians performed worse on knowledge assessment. Integrating CF into the medical education curriculum is ideal; however, faculty knowledge and resource availability remain a challenge. To address this knowledge gap, we support ongoing training sessions by CF specialists, establishing a group of local physicians as designated CF experts to provide continuing guidance to community physicians, and encourage resident-led CF research by providing support to mentors overseeing CF research and promoting CF as an area of active research in Egypt. Most PwCF in Egypt are cared for in university settings and/or private practice. The role of the MoH physicians involves reassessing patients with CF in the MoH clinics before dispensing government-subsidized CF medications. Awareness and recognition of CF by MoH physicians is key to establishing national recognition of CF in Egypt and enabling better patient access to CF medications. Our results demonstrated that MoH physicians performed significantly worse than academic and private practitioners on the knowledge assessment, likely because of lack of CF training. Building on our previous model used in the university settings, our focus will be to provide foundational CF knowledge to MoH physicians. Further evaluation of the current CF care in Egypt suggests the need for a robust multidisciplinary team approach. One of the universities assembled multidisciplinary teams that include pediatric pulmonologists, pediatric nutritionists, physical medicine, and rehabilitation specialists in addition to nursing staff. These teams lack social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists. Last, recognizing the substantial role of families of PwCF in CF care, new training programs for families are underway as a part of a holistic approach to educating the community. One limitation of this study was that the response rate was relatively low. However, the number of respondents was still large enough to make generalizable conclusions about the current state of clinician CF knowledge in Egypt. Information gained from this survey will help direct the educational initiatives to focus on for medical school curricula and MoH physicians. In addition, establishing multidisciplinary teams and implementing quality improvement initiatives can enhance CF care in Egypt.\",\n          \"Paediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. Within the United Kingdom alone, approximately 37,000 tonsillectomies are performed annually\\u00a0[ SDB is an umbrella term used to describe a spectrum of sleep-related breathing disorders that includes snoring, central apnoea, hypoventilation, and obstructive hypoventilation. The most severe manifestation of obstructive hypoventilation is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which is diagnosed on overnight polysomnography. OSA is characterised by repeated episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction, resulting in abnormal ventilation and patterns of sleep. The breathing events that occur during OSA are categorised into apnoeas (pause in breathing lasting at least 10 seconds), hypoapnoeas (a reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds), and respiratory effort-related arousal (an increased respiratory effort that culminates in arousal but does not meet the definition of apnoea or hypopnoea) [ Adenotonsillectomy is an established and safe method for the treatment of OSA. Traditionally, children undergoing adenotonsillectomy were admitted due to the potential risk of a primary bleed and to monitor oral intake and optimise analgesia. There were also concerns for respiratory complications, such as needing supplemental oxygen following surgery and in certain cases needing to commence continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation where the indication for surgery was OSA [ Over the last decade, data have demonstrated the safety of day-case surgery in selected children both at district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric centres. In 2019, the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) report proposed a target of 70% for specialist trusts [ Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of our centre against national targets for day-case tonsillectomy rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are (a) to assess postoperative outcomes in high-risk paediatric patients, specifically those aged two years and weighing between 12-15 kg. (b) To evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe OSA as identified through preoperative polysomnography. (c) To develop and implement a day-case tonsillectomy guideline tailored for use in our specialist centre and surrounding district general hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who had undergone tonsillectomy between April 2021 and September 2022 and were under the age of 18 at the time of surgery. Patients were also included in our analyses if they had undergone other surgical procedures concurrently, provided that the additional procedure would not have otherwise impacted the length of hospital stay, for example, adenoidectomy or grommet insertion. Patients with complex medical comorbidities were not excluded. These patients are factored into the national day-case rate target of 75%. Patients were operated at two hospital sites (St. Mary\\u2019s Hospital, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital). Bipolar, cold steel, or a hybrid technique (bipolar and cold steel) was used for all cases (based on surgeon preference at the time of surgery). Data were collected from electronic patient records (Cerner, Oracle) entered by all clinical staff involved with patient care. Reasons for postoperative admission and clinical events until discharge were noted. Postoperative complications, including re-admission rate and re-attendance to the hospital within 14 days of the procedure were recorded. Two separate subgroup analyses were conducted of high-risk patients. Subgroup A included patients aged two years at the time of surgery and weighing 12-15 kg. Subgroup B included patients with severe OSA on preoperative polysomnography (Figure  OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea A total of 180 patients were initially listed for tonsillectomy. In total, 66 patients were excluded as tonsillectomy was not performed. A total of 117 patients were included in the final analyses. Median age was four (range = 2-15 years old) with 62% male (n = 72). Overall, 46 patients had associated comorbidities, with asthma (n = 12), prematurity (n = 7), autistic spectrum disorder (n = 6), and trisomy 21 (n = 4) being the most prevalent. In total, 90 patients underwent tonsillectomy for OSA/SDB, 13 for a combination of OSA/SDB and recurrent tonsillitis, 13 for recurrent tonsillitis in the absence of OSA/SDB, and one patient underwent tonsillectomy to obtain histology. Of those in the OSA/SDB subgroup, 68% (n = 70) had a preoperative sleep study. Same-day discharge rate 26%. In total, 86 patients were admitted postoperatively. Forty-four required overnight oxygen saturation monitoring, 35 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile), and seven for poor oral intake postoperatively. Of those admitted overnight, 81% (n = 70) remained clinically well and did not require medical input. Overall, 88% (n = 76) were discharged the following day. Eighteen patients returned to ED within 14 days of discharge: eight for pain, five due to poor oral intake, three for pyrexia, and two for post-tonsillectomy bleeding. Both patients who returned with post-tonsillectomy bleeding were managed conservatively and discharged the following day (Table  OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea; SDB = sleep-disordered breathing Subgroup A Of the 117 patients included in the analysis, 17 met the criteria. In total, 11 patients were male. The mean weight was 13.4 kg. Overall, 16 patients had no comorbidities. One patient had a genetic disease ( Subgroup B A total of 34 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was four years old (68% male). Overall, 94% (n = 32) had concurrent adenoidectomy. All patients were admitted postoperatively: 18 for overnight oxygen saturation monitoring and 16 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile). Overall, 79% (n = 27) remained clinically well and did not require medical input overnight. Four had a single transient oxygen desaturation that recovered spontaneously, occurring at 6-12 hours (n = 1), 12-18 hours (n = 2), and >24 hours (n = 1) after surgery. Two had desaturations that required oxygen supplementation (both within four hours after surgery); these patients had associated comorbidities, asthma and trisomy 21, respectively. Both were off oxygen within 12 hours. One primary bleed occurred that was managed conservatively. In total, 31 (91%) patients were discharged the next day. Binary logistic regression Logistic regression analysis was conducted to ascertain if age, weight, sex, or procedure time could be predictors for the need for supplementary oxygen or length of stay (more than one night). The model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (Nagelkerke R Our study evaluated the outcomes of 117 paediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy, either as a standalone procedure or in conjunction with other surgeries. The overall same-day discharge rate observed was 26%. When excluding patients from subgroup A and subgroup B, the same-day discharge rate increased to 40%. The majority of patients who required overnight admission remained stable and were discharged the following day. The current national average for same-day discharges following tonsillectomy in specialist trusts is 55% [ In total, 18 patients returned within 14 days post-surgery, with the majority (n = 13) presenting due to postoperative pain. This is higher (11% vs. 0.3%) than the rates reported at other specialist trusts with a day-case rate of <50% [ Weight under 15 kg was previously associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. The ENT UK consensus statement in 2009 advised that children under the age of two or three and weighing less than 15 kg should be referred onwards for consideration of tonsillectomy at regional centres [ Similarly, it was also thought that children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for severe OSA had an increased risk of postoperative complications. However, the incidence of major respiratory complications was no greater in children undergoing tonsillectomy for OSA compared to those having adenotonsillectomy for non-OSA indications [ The binary logistic model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.114), suggesting that the selected variables (age, weight, total operative time, and sex) were not predictors of this desaturation within our cohort. Despite the lack of overall model significance, weight approached significance (p = 0.071) with an odds ratio of 0.468. This trend, while not statistically significant, aligns with clinical observations that children with lower weight are at an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications [ Limitations Referrals to our tertiary centre are received from West London and surrounding areas, as well as across South West England. Our electronic health records are integrated across seven hospitals in West London, three of which provide paediatric emergency services. Patients presenting with postoperative complications outside our catchment area are advised to attend their nearest emergency department with otolaryngology out-of-hours coverage. Consequently, such data may not have been captured, potentially contributing to a lower post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate compared to national reports. Additionally, this study was retrospective in design and involved a small sample size due to the reduced level of operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits the generalisability of the findings. A multicentre study would have been beneficial when looking at the impact COVID-19 was having on day-case tonsillectomies across the United Kingdom. The use of binary logistic regression analysis in this context may not fully capture the variability and complexity of the population, thereby affecting the robustness and applicability of the results to a broader patient cohort. The findings of this study provide some of the first insights into the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre.\\u00a0While the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, the majority of patients, including those in high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours.\\u00a0Future work will focus on a

increased survival, but is insufficiently developed to prevent rop with poor oxygen control and a lack of screening and treatment programs [ the retina is part of the central nervous system, and any stage of rop is associated with reduced brain volumes at term-equivalent age and poorer neurodevelopment at 2 years of age [ laser therapy for rop requires general anesthesia more often and for a longer time than anti-vegf injections, with an increased risk to fragile preterm infants. laser ablation destroys the peripheral retina and reduces the release of angiogenic factors. the alternative treatments, intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) agents, are effective in suppressing neovascularization but suppress vegf systemically for prolonged periods with poorly known long-term systemic consequences. the large variation in the incidence and severity of rop in different countries and settings, depending on the quality of care, shows that rop is largely preventable. in addition, one might speculate that rop preventive measures may also promote general health and brain development. this narrative review focuses on recent achievements in the prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment of rop. pubmed was searched for relevant papers published up to march 2024 using the search terms retinopathy of prematurity, prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment. fetal retinal vascularization occurs from the optic nerve head to the periphery, guided by a circular moving wave of o establishing an internationally recognized classification system for rop severity allows the evaluation of incidence and interventions in all settings. the most recent international rop classification was published in 2021 [ several risk factors are associated with rop. immaturity with low ga, low birth weight, and oxygen supplementation are major risk factors. poor early neonatal weight gain and low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) are strongly associated risk factors often used in rop prediction [ oxygen supplementation is life-saving for extremely preterm infants, but is also a risk factor for rop. after preterm birth, \\u201cphysiological hypoxia\\u201d of the peripheral retina is replaced by relative hyperoxia with oxygen supplementation, which varies. intermittent apnea also contributes to fluctuating oxygenation, which is particularly detrimental to the development of retinal blood vessels [ the neonatal oxygenation prospective meta-analysis collaboration compared a constant oxygen saturation (spo evidence suggests that targeting lower spo most extremely preterm infants become anemic and receive one or more transfusions of adult erythrocytes. adult hemoglobin (hba) has a lower oxygen affinity than fetal hemoglobin (hbf) and appears to deliver more oxygen to the brain [ a low hbf fraction is an independent risk factor [ studies on the effects of nutritional intervention in preterm infants have mainly addressed neurodevelopmental outcomes. however, according to a meta-analysis, initiating parenteral lipids (\\u22651.5 g/kg/day within the first 24 h of birth) has a favorable effect on rop compared to lower initial doses and/or later initiation [ mothers\\u2019 own milk (mom) is the best choice for all infants and is superior to donor human milk (dhm) in promoting growth and development. ethical concerns preclude randomized trials comparing mom and dhm. however, a randomized trial of 243 infants with ga <30 weeks compared dhm and preterm formula as substitutes for mom when the supply was insufficient. a group of infants who received only mom was also included. of those fed exclusively mom, 5.6% developed proliferative rop stage 3 versus 19% fed dhm in addition to mom versus 14% in the preterm formula-supplemented group, suggesting a protective effect of mom against severe rop [ the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (lcpufa) docosahexaenoic acid (dha), is essential for brain and retinal development and accumulates in the fetus from approximately 30 weeks of ga. the supply is dependent on maternal intake. the role of the omega-6 lcpufa arachidonic acid (ara) in neurodevelopment and rop has received little attention. ara is constantly supplied to the fetus during gestation. it is enriched in the immune system and vasculature and plays essential roles in vascularizing neuronal tissues [ supplementation of fatty acids in preterm infants has mainly comprised omega-3 lcpufa in various forms. in a mouse model of rop, omega-3 lcpufa supplementation reduced pathologic neovascularization [ in the mega donna mega trial, infants born with ga <28 weeks were randomized to receive enteral ara (100 mg/kg/day) plus dha (50 mg/kg/day) or no supplementation from within 3 days after birth until 40 weeks pma. the supplement reduced severe rop by 50% [ some clinical studies have reported an association between neonatal hyperglycemia and rop [ experimental evidence suggests that the nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol may downregulate vegf, igf-1 mrna, and hif-1\\u03b1 in hypoxic retina [ screening for rop involves repeated, often painful, and stressful retinal examinations using intense light and dilated pupils. in sweden, only 5.6% of screened infants required treatment in 2021 [ however, the

ga 24\\u201330 weeks and registered in the swedish national registry for rop (swedrop) [ with the increasing number of infants at risk for severe rop, the burden of rop screening and treatment has increased, and the availability of specially trained ophthalmologists is poor, especially in low-resource settings. telemedicine, with bedside wide-field retinal photography and the transfer of images to a specialist for rop grading, has proven to be a safe and cost-effective complement to ophthalmoscopy [ laser photocoagulation of the avascular retina to halt the production of angiogenic factors such as vegf has long been the most common treatment for sight-threatening rop. over the last decade, the use of easily administered intravitreal injections of anti-vegf agents has increased worldwide. randomized controlled trials (rcts) have compared laser treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (beat-rop trial) [ anti-vegf agents are valuable alternatives to lasers for the treatment of rop. they are easily administered and are efficient. however, they leak into the circulation and suppress systemic vegf levels, which have unknown effects on developing tissues including the brain. bevacizumab remains in the circulation and suppresses vegf levels for 2 months. the most common dose is 0.625 mg per intravitreal injection; however, lower doses may be as efficient. bevacizumab doses as low as 0.002 mg were associated with reduced circulating vegf levels during the first 4 weeks after treatment. further studies on doses and long-term consequences are needed. the prolonged period of recurrence risk implies the need for detailed retinal examinations at ages when examinations have become a challenge, and sedation or general anesthesia is often needed. laser therapy requires general anesthesia more frequently than anti-vegf treatment, requires considerable skill, and requires more time. laser therapy will continue to be a valuable therapy for severe rop as a primary treatment, for the treatment of recurrences after anti-vegf therapy as rescue therapy, and to reduce the need for intensive follow-up. rop increasingly affects infants born during the second trimester of pregnancy and/or in less developed settings lacking oxygen monitoring, as well as programs for rop screening and treatment. screening examinations are painful, and laser treatment is destructive.

sdb = sleep-disordered breathing subgroup a of the 117 patients included in the analysis, 17 met the criteria. in total, 11 patients were male. the mean weight was 13.4 kg. overall, 16 patients had no comorbidities. one patient had a genetic disease ( subgroup b a total of 34 patients met the inclusion criteria. the median age was four years old (68% male). overall, 94% (n = 32) had concurrent adenoidectomy. all patients were admitted postoperatively: 18 for overnight oxygen saturation monitoring and 16 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile). overall, 79% (n = 27) remained clinically well and did not require medical input overnight. four had a single transient oxygen desaturation that recovered spontaneously, occurring at 6-12 hours (n = 1), 12-18 hours (n = 2), and >24 hours (n = 1) after surgery. two had desaturations that required oxygen supplementation (both within four hours after surgery); these patients had associated comorbidities, asthma and trisomy 21, respectively. both were off oxygen within 12 hours. one primary bleed occurred that was managed conservatively. in total, 31 (91%) patients were discharged the next day. binary logistic regression logistic regression analysis was conducted to ascertain if age, weight, sex, or procedure time could be predictors for the need for supplementary oxygen or length of stay (more than one night). the model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (nagelkerke r our study evaluated the outcomes of 117 paediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy, either as a standalone procedure or in conjunction with other surgeries. the overall same-day discharge rate observed was 26%. when excluding patients from subgroup a and subgroup b, the same-day discharge rate increased to 40%. the majority of patients who required overnight admission remained stable and were discharged the following day. the current national average for same-day discharges following tonsillectomy in specialist trusts is 55% [ in total, 18 patients returned within 14 days post-surgery, with the majority (n = 13) presenting due to postoperative pain. this is higher (11% vs. 0.3%) than the rates reported at other specialist trusts with a day-case rate of <50% [ weight under 15 kg was previously associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. the ent uk consensus statement in 2009 advised that children under the age of two or three and weighing less than 15 kg should be referred onwards for consideration of tonsillectomy at regional centres [ similarly, it was also thought that children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for severe osa had an increased risk of postoperative complications. however, the incidence of major respiratory complications was no greater in children undergoing tonsillectomy for osa compared to those having adenotonsillectomy for non-osa indications [ the binary logistic model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.114), suggesting that the selected variables (age, weight, total operative time, and sex) were not predictors of this desaturation within our cohort. despite the lack of overall model significance, weight approached significance (p = 0.071) with an odds ratio of 0.468. this trend, while not statistically significant, aligns with clinical observations that children with lower weight are at an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications [ limitations referrals to our tertiary centre are received from west london and surrounding areas, as well as across south west england. our electronic health records are integrated across seven hospitals in west london, three of which provide paediatric emergency services. patients presenting with postoperative complications outside our catchment area are advised to attend their nearest emergency department with otolaryngology out-of-hours coverage. consequently, such data may not have been captured, potentially contributing to a lower post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate compared to national reports. additionally, this study was retrospective in design and involved a small sample size due to the reduced level of operating during the covid-19 pandemic, which limits the generalisability of the findings. a multicentre study would have been beneficial when looking at the impact covid-19 was having on day-case tonsillectomies across the united kingdom. the use of binary logistic regression analysis in this context may not fully capture the variability and complexity of the population, thereby affecting the robustness and applicability of the results to a broader patient cohort. the findings of this study provide some of the first insights into the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomy during the covid-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre. while the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, the majority of patients, including those in high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours. future work will focus on a prospective study measuring outcomes following the implementation of our day-case guidelines that standardised analgesic regimens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

nine clinical research sites in japan enrolled participants (see list of investigators in tomomi hakoda nippon kokan fukuyama hospital fukuyama, japan satoshi kuroyanagi kishiwada tokushu-kai hospital osaka, japan yoshimitsu yamasaki kyosokai amc nishi-umeda clinic osaka, japan kenshi fujii sakurabashi watanabe hospital osaka, japan atsushi sueyoshi uji tokushu-kai hospital osaka, japan akitaka nakata sanai hospital saitama, japan fumiki oh shinden higashi clinic sendai, japan tatsushi sugiura soka-sugiura clinic soka, japan toshiyuki sugiura sugiura clinic tokyo, japan participants included japanese men and women (not pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant) that were 18-80 years of age who had not achieved treatment goals in accordance with the 2022 japan atherosclerosis society guidelines for prevention of ascvd participants were randomized using an automated interactive response technology system in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: one 2.5 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, one 5 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, or one matching placebo tablet per day, for an 8-week treatment period. randomization was stratified according to screening ldl-c level of ≥ 100 or ＜100 mg/dl. following randomization, participants were evaluated at the clinic at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (end of treatment) for efficacy, safety, and pk assessments, and at week 12 for final safety and pk assessments. during the 8-week treatment period, participants were instructed to take the study drugs orally once daily at approximately the same time each morning, and to bring all their study drug supply to the site at the clinic visits, where compliance was evaluated by counting unused tablets. the investigators, participants, clinical research organization, and sponsor of the trial were blinded to all lipid results from randomization until all participants had completed the final treatment visit and the database was locked. fasting blood samples were collected at each clinic visit throughout the trial. testing was completed by medpace reference laboratories (singapore) who performed the clinical laboratory analyses, and medpace bioanalytic laboratories (cincinnati, oh, usa) who performed the pk sample analysis as described previously the primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 8 in friedewald-calculated ldl-c for each obicetrapib group compared with placebo. secondary and other efficacy endpoints included apob, non-hdl-c, hdl-c, vldl-c, apoe, and tg. safety and tolerability endpoints included clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and adverse events. a sample size of at least 100 evaluable participants (25 per treatment group) was expected to provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% difference in ldl-c reduction at week 8 (standard deviation of 25%) for each of the obicetrapib treatment groups compared to placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. a total of 102 subjects were randomized. all statistical analyses were performed using sas® version 9.4 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa). the primary analysis population was the intent-to-treat (itt) population, i.e., all randomized participants. efficacy analyses were also conducted in a per protocol population (all participants in the itt population with ldl-c measured at baseline and week 8, and with no major protocol deviations). the pk analysis was performed in all participants in the itt population assigned to one of the three obicetrapib dose groups who had sufficient blood samples collected for valid estimation of pk parameters, and the safety analyses were completed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug. the analysis of the percent change from baseline to end of treatment in friedewald-calculated ldl-c (the primary endpoint) was performed with a mixed model for repeated measures (mmrm) approach using sas® proc mixed. the analysis included fixed effects for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline value as a continuous covariate. the restricted maximum likelihood estimation approach was used with an unstructured covariance matrix. least squares (ls) means, standard errors (se), and two-sided 95% confidence intervals for each treatment group and for the pairwise comparisons of each dose of obicetrapib to the placebo group were determined, and the ls means for the pairwise comparison and its se were used for the hypothesis testing. to maintain the overall alpha level on the primary endpoint, the hypothesis testing was performed sequentially at the two-sided alpha=0.05 significance level. the first comparison was the 10 mg obicetrapib group vs. placebo; if significant, the comparison of the 5 mg group vs. placebo was performed next followed by the 2.5 mg group vs. placebo. hypothesis testing proceeded in this hierarchical step-down fashion until a comparison was not significant at which point the remaining sequential tests were deemed not significant. the mmrm model included all available assessments of percent change in ldl-c from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 8. the model assumed the data were missing at random. missing data were not imputed for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis; for other analyses, the model implicitly estimated missing data by assuming they followed the same distribution as observed data conditioned on baseline value and changes over time. similar mmrm models as described for the primary endpoint were used to analyze the secondary and other efficacy endpoints, but without adjustment for multiplicity. nominal p-values are provided when applicable. normality was checked using the shapiro-wilk test. three sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint in the itt population: mmrm with imputation, analysis of covariance (ancova) with fixed effects of treatment group and baseline ldl-c value as a continuous covariate, and ldl-c by preparative ultracentrifugation. safety and pk analyses were summarized descriptively; no statistical inference was applied to these endpoints. all of the 102 randomized subjects completed the treatment and safety/pk follow-up periods and were included in the primary analyses itt defined as all randomized participants; safety defined as all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug; pk defined as all participants in the itt population who had sufficient blood samples collected for valid estimation of pk parameters;

Most minimal/molecular residual disease assays require prior tissue testing to guide ctDNA analysis, resulting in lengthy time to initial results and unevaluable patients. We assessed a tissue-free assay (Guardant Reveal) that bioinformatically evaluates >20,000 epigenomic regions for ctDNA detection in 1,977 longitudinally collected postoperative plasma samples from 342 patients with resected colorectal cancer. We observed sensitive and specific detection of minimal/molecular residual disease associated with clinically meaningful differences in recurrence-free intervals at each time point evaluated with a median lead time of 5.3 months. The longitudinal sensitivity in stage II or higher colon cancer was 81%. Sensitivity increased with serial measurement and varied by recurrence site: higher for liver (100%) versus lung (53%) and peritoneal (40%). Sensitivity among patients with rectal cancer was 60% owing to a high proportion of lung metastases. Specificity was 98.2% among 1,461 posttreatment samples (99.1% among those with follow-up longer than the upper IQR of the lead time observed in this study). Our data demonstrate the potential clinical utility of ctDNA as a tool to improve the management of stage II and higher colorectal cancer with a methodology that is noninvasive, accessible, and allows for rapid evaluation to inform clinical decisions.\",\n          \"Antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a major threat to global health, exacerbated by the misuse of antibiotics. In hospital practice, results of bacterial cultures and antibiograms can take several days. Meanwhile, prescribing an empirical antimicrobial treatment is challenging, as clinicians must balance the antibiotic spectrum against the expected probability of susceptibility. We present here a proof of concept study of a machine learning-based system that predicts the probability of antimicrobial susceptibility and explains the contribution of the different cofactors in hospitalized patients, at four different stages prior to the antibiogram (sampling, direct examination, positive culture, and species identification), using only historical bacterial ecology data that can be easily collected from any laboratory information system (LIS) without GDPR restrictions once the data have been anonymised. A comparative analysis of different state-of-the-art machine learning and probabilistic methods was performed using 44,026 instances over 7 years from the H\\u00f4pital Europ\\u00e9en Marseille, France. Our results show that multilayer dense neural networks and Bayesian models are suitable for early prediction of antibiotic susceptibility, with AUROCs reaching 0.88 at the positive culture stage and 0.92 at the species identification stage, and even 0.82 and 0.92, respectively, for the least frequent situations. Perspectives and potential clinical applications of the system are discussed.\",\n          \"Chronic wounds are a growing concern due to aging populations, sedentary lifestyles and increasing rates of obesity and chronic diseases. The impact of such wounds is felt worldwide, posing a considerable clinical, environmental and socioeconomic challenge and impacting the quality of life. The increasing complexity of care requires a holistic approach, along with extensive knowledge and skills. The challenge experienced by health\\u2010care professionals is particularly significant for newly graduate nurses, who face a gap between theory and practice. Digital tools, such as mobile applications, can support wound care by facilitating more precise assessments, early treatment, complication prevention and better outcomes. They also aid in clinical decision\\u2010making and improve healthcare delivery in remote areas. Several mobile applications have emerged to enhance wound care. However, there are no applications dedicated to newly graduate nurses. The aim of this study was to co\\u2010create and evaluate an algorithm for the development of a wound care mobile application supporting clinical decisions for new graduate nurses. The development of this mobile application is envisioned to improve knowledge application and facilitate evidence\\u2010based practice. This study is part of a multiphase project that adopted a pragmatic epistemological approach, using the \\u2018Knowledge\\u2010to\\u2010Action\\u2019 conceptual model and Duchscher's Stages of Transition Theory. Following a scoping review, an expert consensus, and stakeholder meetings, this study was pursued through a sequential exploratory mixed methods design carried out in two phases. In the initial phase, 21 participants engaged in semi\\u2010structured focus groups to explore their needs regarding clinical decision support in wound care, explore their perceptions of the future mobile application's content and identify and categorize essential components. Through descriptive analysis, five overarching themes emerged, serving as guiding principles for conceptual data model development and refinement. These findings confirmed the significance of integrating a comprehensive glossary complemented by photos, ensuring compatibility between the mobile application and existing documentation systems, and providing quick access to information to avoid burdening work routines. Subsequently, the algorithm was created from the qualitative data collected. The second phase involved presenting an online SurveyMonkey\\u00ae questionnaire to 34 participants who were not part of the initial phase to quantitatively measure the usability of this algorithm among future users. This phase revealed very positive feedback regarding the usability [score of 6.33 (\\u00b10.19) on a scale of 1\\u20137], which reinforces its quality.

Laser ablation destroys the peripheral retina and reduces the release of angiogenic factors. The alternative treatments, intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents, are effective in suppressing neovascularization but suppress VEGF systemically for prolonged periods with poorly known long-term systemic consequences. The large variation in the incidence and severity of ROP in different countries and settings, depending on the quality of care, shows that ROP is largely preventable. In addition, one might speculate that ROP preventive measures may also promote general health and brain development. This narrative review focuses on recent achievements in the prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment of ROP. PubMed was searched for relevant papers published up to March 2024 using the search terms retinopathy of prematurity, prevention, prediction, screening, and treatment. Fetal retinal vascularization occurs from the optic nerve head to the periphery, guided by a circular moving wave of O Establishing an internationally recognized classification system for ROP severity allows the evaluation of incidence and interventions in all settings. The most recent international ROP classification was published in 2021 [ Several risk factors are associated with ROP. Immaturity with low GA, low birth weight, and oxygen supplementation are major risk factors. Poor early neonatal weight gain and low circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are strongly associated risk factors often used in ROP prediction [ Oxygen supplementation is life-saving for extremely preterm infants, but is also a risk factor for ROP. After preterm birth, \\u201cphysiological hypoxia\\u201d of the peripheral retina is replaced by relative hyperoxia with oxygen supplementation, which varies. Intermittent apnea also contributes to fluctuating oxygenation, which is particularly detrimental to the development of retinal blood vessels [ The Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective Meta-analysis Collaboration compared a constant oxygen saturation (SpO Evidence suggests that targeting lower SpO Most extremely preterm infants become anemic and receive one or more transfusions of adult erythrocytes. Adult hemoglobin (HbA) has a lower oxygen affinity than fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and appears to deliver more oxygen to the brain [ A low HbF fraction is an independent risk factor [ Studies on the effects of nutritional intervention in preterm infants have mainly addressed neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, according to a meta-analysis, initiating parenteral lipids (\\u22651.5 g/kg/day within the first 24 h of birth) has a favorable effect on ROP compared to lower initial doses and/or later initiation [ Mothers\\u2019 own milk (MOM) is the best choice for all infants and is superior to donor human milk (DHM) in promoting growth and development. Ethical concerns preclude randomized trials comparing MOM and DHM. However, a randomized trial of 243 infants with GA <30 weeks compared DHM and preterm formula as substitutes for MOM when the supply was insufficient. A group of infants who received only MOM was also included. Of those fed exclusively MOM, 5.6% developed proliferative ROP stage 3 versus 19% fed DHM in addition to MOM versus 14% in the preterm formula-supplemented group, suggesting a protective effect of MOM against severe ROP [ The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is essential for brain and retinal development and accumulates in the fetus from approximately 30 weeks of GA. The supply is dependent on maternal intake. The role of the omega-6 LCPUFA arachidonic acid (ArA) in neurodevelopment and ROP has received little attention. ArA is constantly supplied to the fetus during gestation. It is enriched in the immune system and vasculature and plays essential roles in vascularizing neuronal tissues [ Supplementation of fatty acids in preterm infants has mainly comprised omega-3 LCPUFA in various forms. In a mouse model of ROP, omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation reduced pathologic neovascularization [ In the Mega Donna Mega trial, infants born with GA <28 weeks were randomized to receive enteral ArA (100 mg/kg/day) plus DHA (50 mg/kg/day) or no supplementation from within 3 days after birth until 40 weeks PMA. The supplement reduced severe ROP by 50% [ Some clinical studies have reported an association between neonatal hyperglycemia and ROP [ Experimental evidence suggests that the nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol may downregulate VEGF, IGF-1 mRNA, and HIF-1\\u03b1 in hypoxic retina [ Screening for ROP involves repeated, often painful, and stressful retinal examinations using intense light and dilated pupils. In Sweden, only 5.6% of screened infants required treatment in 2021 [ However, the infants\\u2019 weights are not always readily available to ophthalmologists. Therefore, DIGIROP-birth was created based on birth characteristics GA, BW, sex, and postnatal age in 7,609 infants born at GA 24\\u201330 weeks and registered in the Swedish National Registry for ROP (SWEDROP) [ With the increasing number of infants at risk for severe ROP, the burden of ROP screening and treatment has increased, and the availability of specially trained ophthalmologists is poor, especially in low-resource settings. Telemedicine, with bedside wide-field retinal photography and the transfer of images to a specialist for ROP grading, has proven to be a safe and cost-effective complement to ophthalmoscopy [ Laser photocoagulation of the avascular retina to halt the production of angiogenic factors such as VEGF has long been the most common treatment for sight-threatening ROP. Over the last decade, the use of easily administered intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents has increased worldwide. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared laser treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (BEAT-ROP trial) [ Anti-VEGF agents are valuable alternatives to lasers for the treatment of ROP. They are easily administered and are efficient. However, they leak into the circulation and suppress systemic VEGF levels, which have unknown effects on developing tissues including the brain. Bevacizumab remains in the circulation and suppresses VEGF levels for 2 months. The most common dose is 0.625 mg per intravitreal injection; however, lower doses may be as efficient. Bevacizumab doses as low as 0.002 mg were associated with reduced circulating VEGF levels during the first 4 weeks after treatment. Further studies on doses and long-term consequences are needed. The prolonged period of recurrence risk implies the need for detailed retinal examinations at ages when examinations have become a challenge, and sedation or general anesthesia is often needed. Laser therapy requires general anesthesia more frequently than anti-VEGF treatment, requires considerable skill, and requires more time. Laser therapy will continue to be a valuable therapy for severe ROP as a primary treatment, for the treatment of recurrences after anti-VEGF therapy as rescue therapy, and to reduce the need for intensive follow-up. ROP increasingly affects infants born during the second trimester of pregnancy and/or in less developed settings lacking oxygen monitoring, as well as programs for ROP screening and treatment. Screening examinations are painful, and laser treatment is destructive. ROP would not occur if preterm births could be prevented. Measures to improve maternal health and supplement women with DHA deficiency may help prolong gestation [ The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

A 28-question survey was distributed to approximately 400 Egyptian physicians at the Egyptian Congress of Pediatric Pulmonology and through physician WhatsApp groups over a period of 3 months. The survey was adopted from an already validated survey that was used to evaluate CF knowledge in Eastern Europe ( The survey was available for 3 months, and two reminders were sent to the WhatsApp group. The majority of survey participants were \\u2a7d40\\u2009years old (69%), female (67.3%), and practiced in a university setting (69.9%) as specialists (83.2%). More than half of the participants reported seeing PwCF only when they were sick. Fifty-six percent of participants reported working at a hospital setting that has established CF guidelines that were adapted from the CF Foundation guidelines and modified based on resource availability in Egypt ( Demographic distribution of questionnaire participants Variations in resource accessibility among participants Data are given as  On the survey\\u2019s knowledge-assessment portion, the percentage of correct answers was 67.3%\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200913.4%. CF gastrointestinal manifestations and diagnostics were among the most missed answers. Chronic abdominal pain, rectal prolapse, and fecal elastase levels as a diagnostic tool were missed by 69.6%, 77.7%, and 64.6% of survey participants, respectively. Participants in private or university settings scored significantly higher than those working at other settings, with the majority being employed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) ( The findings of this study identify areas for educational and clinical improvement in CF care in Egypt. Previous targeted trainings for academic physicians by our team have made modest gains, yet there remains a considerable gap in CF knowledge. Future educational endeavors must concentrate on expanding CF knowledge beyond the academic setting. Notably, most participants failed to identify the gastrointestinal manifestations and complications of CF. This knowledge gap is likely due to reduced emphasis on diverse CF presentations in formal physician education. This is further supported by our finding that recently graduated physicians performed worse on knowledge assessment. Integrating CF into the medical education curriculum is ideal; however, faculty knowledge and resource availability remain a challenge. To address this knowledge gap, we support ongoing training sessions by CF specialists, establishing a group of local physicians as designated CF experts to provide continuing guidance to community physicians, and encourage resident-led CF research by providing support to mentors overseeing CF research and promoting CF as an area of active research in Egypt. Most PwCF in Egypt are cared for in university settings and/or private practice. The role of the MoH physicians involves reassessing patients with CF in the MoH clinics before dispensing government-subsidized CF medications. Awareness and recognition of CF by MoH physicians is key to establishing national recognition of CF in Egypt and enabling better patient access to CF medications. Our results demonstrated that MoH physicians performed significantly worse than academic and private practitioners on the knowledge assessment, likely because of lack of CF training. Building on our previous model used in the university settings, our focus will be to provide foundational CF knowledge to MoH physicians. Further evaluation of the current CF care in Egypt suggests the need for a robust multidisciplinary team approach. One of the universities assembled multidisciplinary teams that include pediatric pulmonologists, pediatric nutritionists, physical medicine, and rehabilitation specialists in addition to nursing staff. These teams lack social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists. Last, recognizing the substantial role of families of PwCF in CF care, new training programs for families are underway as a part of a holistic approach to educating the community. One limitation of this study was that the response rate was relatively low. However, the number of respondents was still large enough to make generalizable conclusions about the current state of clinician CF knowledge in Egypt. Information gained from this survey will help direct the educational initiatives to focus on for medical school curricula and MoH physicians. In addition, establishing multidisciplinary teams and implementing quality improvement initiatives can enhance CF care in Egypt.\",\n          \"Paediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. Within the United Kingdom alone, approximately 37,000 tonsillectomies are performed annually\\u00a0[ SDB is an umbrella term used to describe a spectrum of sleep-related breathing disorders that includes snoring, central apnoea, hypoventilation, and obstructive hypoventilation. The most severe manifestation of obstructive hypoventilation is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), which is diagnosed on overnight polysomnography. OSA is characterised by repeated episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction, resulting in abnormal ventilation and patterns of sleep. The breathing events that occur during OSA are categorised into apnoeas (pause in breathing lasting at least 10 seconds), hypoapnoeas (a reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds), and respiratory effort-related arousal (an increased respiratory effort that culminates in arousal but does not meet the definition of apnoea or hypopnoea) [ Adenotonsillectomy is an established and safe method for the treatment of OSA. Traditionally, children undergoing adenotonsillectomy were admitted due to the potential risk of a primary bleed and to monitor oral intake and optimise analgesia. There were also concerns for respiratory complications, such as needing supplemental oxygen following surgery and in certain cases needing to commence continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation where the indication for surgery was OSA [ Over the last decade, data have demonstrated the safety of day-case surgery in selected children both at district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric centres. In 2019, the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) report proposed a target of 70% for specialist trusts [ Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of our centre against national targets for day-case tonsillectomy rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are (a) to assess postoperative outcomes in high-risk paediatric patients, specifically those aged two years and weighing between 12-15 kg. (b) To evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe OSA as identified through preoperative polysomnography. (c) To develop and implement a day-case tonsillectomy guideline tailored for use in our specialist centre and surrounding district general hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who had undergone tonsillectomy between April 2021 and September 2022 and were under the age of 18 at the time of surgery. Patients were also included in our analyses if they had undergone other surgical procedures concurrently, provided that the additional procedure would not have otherwise impacted the length of hospital stay, for example, adenoidectomy or grommet insertion. Patients with complex medical comorbidities were not excluded. These patients are factored into the national day-case rate target of 75%. Patients were operated at two hospital sites (St. Mary\\u2019s Hospital, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital). Bipolar, cold steel, or a hybrid technique (bipolar and cold steel) was used for all cases (based on surgeon preference at the time of surgery). Data were collected from electronic patient records (Cerner, Oracle) entered by all clinical staff involved with patient care. Reasons for postoperative admission and clinical events until discharge were noted. Postoperative complications, including re-admission rate and re-attendance to the hospital within 14 days of the procedure were recorded. Two separate subgroup analyses were conducted of high-risk patients. Subgroup A included patients aged two years at the time of surgery and weighing 12-15 kg. Subgroup B included patients with severe OSA on preoperative polysomnography (Figure  OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea A total of 180 patients were initially listed for tonsillectomy. In total, 66 patients were excluded as tonsillectomy was not performed. A total of 117 patients were included in the final analyses. Median age was four (range = 2-15 years old) with 62% male (n = 72). Overall, 46 patients had associated comorbidities, with asthma (n = 12), prematurity (n = 7), autistic spectrum disorder (n = 6), and trisomy 21 (n = 4) being the most prevalent. In total, 90 patients underwent tonsillectomy for OSA/SDB, 13 for a combination of OSA/SDB and recurrent tonsillitis, 13 for recurrent tonsillitis in the absence of OSA/SDB, and one patient underwent tonsillectomy to obtain histology. Of those in the OSA/SDB subgroup, 68% (n = 70) had a preoperative sleep study. Same-day discharge rate 26%. In total, 86 patients were admitted postoperatively. Forty-four required overnight oxygen saturation monitoring, 35 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile), and seven for poor oral intake postoperatively. Of those admitted overnight, 81% (n = 70) remained clinically well and did not require medical input. Overall, 88% (n = 76) were discharged the following day. Eighteen patients returned to ED within 14 days of discharge: eight for pain, five due to poor oral intake, three for pyrexia, and two for post-tonsillectomy bleeding. Both patients who returned with post-tonsillectomy bleeding were managed conservatively and discharged the following day (Table  OSA = obstructive sleep apnoea; SDB = sleep-disordered breathing Subgroup A Of the 117 patients included in the analysis, 17 met the criteria. In total, 11 patients were male. The mean weight was 13.4 kg. Overall, 16 patients had no comorbidities. One patient had a genetic disease ( Subgroup B A total of 34 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was four years old (68% male). Overall, 94% (n = 32) had concurrent adenoidectomy. All patients were admitted postoperatively: 18 for overnight oxygen saturation monitoring and 16 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile). Overall, 79% (n = 27) remained clinically well and did not require medical input overnight. Four had a single transient oxygen desaturation that recovered spontaneously, occurring at 6-12 hours (n = 1), 12-18 hours (n = 2), and >24 hours (n = 1) after surgery. Two had desaturations that required oxygen supplementation (both within four hours after surgery); these patients had associated comorbidities, asthma and trisomy 21, respectively. Both were off oxygen within 12 hours. One primary bleed occurred that was managed conservatively. In total, 31 (91%) patients were discharged the next day. Binary logistic regression Logistic regression analysis was conducted to ascertain if age, weight, sex, or procedure time could be predictors for the need for supplementary oxygen or length of stay (more than one night). The model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (Nagelkerke R Our study evaluated the outcomes of 117 paediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy, either as a standalone procedure or in conjunction with other surgeries. The overall same-day discharge rate observed was 26%. When excluding patients from subgroup A and subgroup B, the same-day discharge rate increased to 40%. The majority of patients who required overnight admission remained stable and were discharged the following day. The current national average for same-day discharges following tonsillectomy in specialist trusts is 55% [ In total, 18 patients returned within 14 days post-surgery, with the majority (n = 13) presenting due to postoperative pain. This is higher (11% vs. 0.3%) than the rates reported at other specialist trusts with a day-case rate of <50% [ Weight under 15 kg was previously associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. The ENT UK consensus statement in 2009 advised that children under the age of two or three and weighing less than 15 kg should be referred onwards for consideration of tonsillectomy at regional centres [ Similarly, it was also thought that children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for severe OSA had an increased risk of postoperative complications. However, the incidence of major respiratory complications was no greater in children undergoing tonsillectomy for OSA compared to those having adenotonsillectomy for non-OSA indications [ The binary logistic model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.114), suggesting that the selected variables (age, weight, total operative time, and sex) were not predictors of this desaturation within our cohort. Despite the lack of overall model significance, weight approached significance (p = 0.071) with an odds ratio of 0.468. This trend, while not statistically significant, aligns with clinical observations that children with lower weight are at an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications [ Limitations Referrals to our tertiary centre are received from West London and surrounding areas, as well as across South West England. Our electronic health records are integrated across seven hospitals in West London, three of which provide paediatric emergency services. Patients presenting with postoperative complications outside our catchment area are advised to attend their nearest emergency department with otolaryngology out-of-hours coverage. Consequently, such data may not have been captured, potentially contributing to a lower post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate compared to national reports. Additionally, this study was retrospective in design and involved a small sample size due to the reduced level of operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, which limits the generalisability of the findings. A multicentre study would have been beneficial when looking at the impact COVID-19 was having on day-case tonsillectomies across the United Kingdom. The use of binary logistic regression analysis in this context may not fully capture the variability and complexity of the population, thereby affecting the robustness and applicability of the results to a broader patient cohort. The findings of this study provide some of the first insights into the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre.\\u00a0While the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, the majority of patients, including those in high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours.\\u00a0Future work will focus on a prospective study measuring outcomes following the implementation of our day-case guidelines that standardised analgesic regimens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

preterm infants have mainly addressed neurodevelopmental outcomes. however, according to a meta-analysis, initiating parenteral lipids (\\u22651.5 g/kg/day within the first 24 h of birth) has a favorable effect on rop compared to lower initial doses and/or later initiation [ mothers\\u2019 own milk (mom) is the best choice for all infants and is superior to donor human milk (dhm) in promoting growth and development. ethical concerns preclude randomized trials comparing mom and dhm. however, a randomized trial of 243 infants with ga <30 weeks compared dhm and preterm formula as substitutes for mom when the supply was insufficient. a group of infants who received only mom was also included. of those fed exclusively mom, 5.6% developed proliferative rop stage 3 versus 19% fed dhm in addition to mom versus 14% in the preterm formula-supplemented group, suggesting a protective effect of mom against severe rop [ the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (lcpufa) docosahexaenoic acid (dha), is essential for brain and retinal development and accumulates in the fetus from approximately 30 weeks of ga. the supply is dependent on maternal intake. the role of the omega-6 lcpufa arachidonic acid (ara) in neurodevelopment and rop has received little attention. ara is constantly supplied to the fetus during gestation. it is enriched in the immune system and vasculature and plays essential roles in vascularizing neuronal tissues [ supplementation of fatty acids in preterm infants has mainly comprised omega-3 lcpufa in various forms. in a mouse model of rop, omega-3 lcpufa supplementation reduced pathologic neovascularization [ in the mega donna mega trial, infants born with ga <28 weeks were randomized to receive enteral ara (100 mg/kg/day) plus dha (50 mg/kg/day) or no supplementation from within 3 days after birth until 40 weeks pma. the supplement reduced severe rop by 50% [ some clinical studies have reported an association between neonatal hyperglycemia and rop [ experimental evidence suggests that the nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol may downregulate vegf, igf-1 mrna, and hif-1\\u03b1 in hypoxic retina [ screening for rop involves repeated, often painful, and stressful retinal examinations using intense light and dilated pupils. in sweden, only 5.6% of screened infants required treatment in 2021 [ however, the infants\\u2019 weights are not always readily available to ophthalmologists. therefore, digirop-birth was created based on birth characteristics ga, bw, sex, and postnatal age in 7,609 infants born at ga 24\\u201330 weeks and registered in the swedish national registry for rop (swedrop) [ with the increasing number of infants at risk for severe rop, the burden of rop screening and treatment has increased, and the availability of specially trained ophthalmologists is poor, especially in low-resource settings. telemedicine, with bedside wide-field retinal photography and the transfer of images to a specialist for rop grading, has proven to be a safe and cost-effective complement to ophthalmoscopy [ laser photocoagulation of the avascular retina to halt the production of angiogenic factors such as vegf has long been the most common treatment for sight-threatening rop. over the last decade, the use of easily administered intravitreal injections of anti-vegf agents has increased worldwide. randomized controlled trials (rcts) have compared laser treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab (beat-rop trial) [ anti-vegf agents are valuable alternatives to lasers for the treatment of rop. they are easily administered and are efficient. however, they leak into the circulation and suppress systemic vegf levels, which have unknown effects on developing tissues including the brain. bevacizumab remains in the circulation and suppresses vegf levels for 2 months. the most common dose is 0.625 mg per intravitreal injection; however, lower doses may be as efficient. bevacizumab doses as low as 0.002 mg were associated with reduced circulating vegf levels during the first 4 weeks after treatment. further studies on doses and long-term consequences are needed. the prolonged period of recurrence risk implies the need for detailed retinal examinations at ages when examinations have become a challenge, and sedation or general anesthesia is often needed. laser therapy requires general anesthesia more frequently than anti-vegf treatment, requires considerable skill, and requires more time. laser therapy will continue to be a valuable therapy for severe rop as a primary treatment, for the treatment of recurrences after anti-vegf therapy as rescue therapy, and to reduce the need for intensive follow-up. rop increasingly affects infants born during the second trimester of pregnancy and/or in less developed settings lacking oxygen monitoring, as well as programs for rop screening and treatment. screening examinations are painful, and laser treatment is destructive. rop would not occur if preterm births could be prevented. measures to improve maternal health and supplement women with dha deficiency may help prolong gestation [ the authors have no conflicts of

rate is not established in egypt, it was estimated to be 1:2,664 in a 1993 study of neonates based on immune reactive trypsinogen only ( recent collaborations between cf centers (cfcs) on a global scale have resulted in improved cf outcomes in countries with low resources and training ( this study presents the results of a survey assessing the baseline cf knowledge and resource accessibility among physicians in egypt, with an aim to identify areas of weakness that can serve as focus points for trainings nationwide. a 28-question survey was distributed to approximately 400 egyptian physicians at the egyptian congress of pediatric pulmonology and through physician whatsapp groups over a period of 3 months. the survey was adopted from an already validated survey that was used to evaluate cf knowledge in eastern europe ( the survey was available for 3 months, and two reminders were sent to the whatsapp group. the majority of survey participants were \\u2a7d40 years old (69%), female (67.3%), and practiced in a university setting (69.9%) as specialists (83.2%). more than half of the participants reported seeing pwcf only when they were sick. fifty-six percent of participants reported working at a hospital setting that has established cf guidelines that were adapted from the cf foundation guidelines and modified based on resource availability in egypt ( demographic distribution of questionnaire participants variations in resource accessibility among participants data are given as on the survey\\u2019s knowledge-assessment portion, the percentage of correct answers was 67.3% \\u00b1 13.4%. cf gastrointestinal manifestations and diagnostics were among the most missed answers. chronic abdominal pain, rectal prolapse, and fecal elastase levels as a diagnostic tool were missed by 69.6%, 77.7%, and 64.6% of survey participants, respectively. participants in private or university settings scored significantly higher than those working at other settings, with the majority being employed by the ministry of health (moh) ( the findings of this study identify areas for educational and clinical improvement in cf care in egypt. previous targeted trainings for academic physicians by our team have made modest gains, yet there remains a considerable gap in cf knowledge. future educational endeavors must concentrate on expanding cf knowledge beyond the academic setting. notably, most participants failed to identify the gastrointestinal manifestations and complications of cf. this knowledge gap is likely due to reduced emphasis on diverse cf presentations in formal physician education. this is further supported by our finding that recently graduated physicians performed worse on knowledge assessment. integrating cf into the medical education curriculum is ideal; however, faculty knowledge and resource availability remain a challenge. to address this knowledge gap, we support ongoing training sessions by cf specialists, establishing a group of local physicians as designated cf experts to provide continuing guidance to community physicians, and encourage resident-led cf research by providing support to mentors overseeing cf research and promoting cf as an area of active research in egypt. most pwcf in egypt are cared for in university settings and/or private practice. the role of the moh physicians involves reassessing patients with cf in the moh clinics before dispensing government-subsidized cf medications. awareness and recognition of cf by moh physicians is key to establishing national recognition of cf in egypt and enabling better patient access to cf medications. our results demonstrated that moh physicians performed significantly worse than academic and private practitioners on the knowledge assessment, likely because of lack of cf training. building on our previous model used in the university settings, our focus will be to provide foundational cf knowledge to moh physicians. further evaluation of the current cf care in egypt suggests the need for a robust multidisciplinary team approach. one of the universities assembled multidisciplinary teams that include pediatric pulmonologists, pediatric nutritionists, physical medicine, and rehabilitation specialists in addition to nursing staff. these teams lack social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists. last, recognizing the substantial role of families of pwcf in cf care, new training programs for families are underway as a part of a holistic approach to educating the community. one limitation of this study was that the response rate was relatively low. however, the number of respondents was still large enough to make generalizable conclusions about the current state of clinician cf knowledge in egypt. information gained from this survey will help direct the educational initiatives to focus on for medical school curricula and moh physicians. in addition, establishing multidisciplinary teams and implementing quality improvement initiatives can enhance cf care in egypt.\",\n          \"paediatric tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. within the united kingdom alone, approximately 37,000 tonsillectomies are performed annually [ sdb is an umbrella term used to describe a spectrum of sleep-related breathing disorders that includes snoring, central apnoea, hypoventilation, and obstructive hypoventilation. the most severe manifestation of obstructive hypoventilation is obstructive sleep apnoea (osa), which is diagnosed on overnight polysomnography. osa is characterised by repeated episodes of complete or partial upper airway obstruction, resulting in abnormal ventilation and patterns of sleep. the breathing events that occur during osa are categorised into apnoeas (pause in breathing lasting at least 10 seconds), hypoapnoeas (a reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds), and respiratory effort-related arousal (an increased respiratory effort that culminates in arousal but does not meet the definition of apnoea or hypopnoea) [ adenotonsillectomy is an established and safe method for the treatment of osa. traditionally, children undergoing adenotonsillectomy were admitted due to the potential risk of a primary bleed and to monitor oral intake and optimise analgesia. there were also concerns for respiratory complications, such as needing supplemental oxygen following surgery and in certain cases needing to commence continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) ventilation where the indication for surgery was osa [ over the last decade, data have demonstrated the safety of day-case surgery in selected children both at district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric centres. in 2019, the getting it right first time (girft) report proposed a target of 70% for specialist trusts [ objectives the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of our centre against national targets for day-case tonsillectomy rates during the covid-19 pandemic. the secondary objectives are (a) to assess postoperative outcomes in high-risk paediatric patients, specifically those aged two years and weighing between 12-15 kg. (b) to evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe osa as identified through preoperative polysomnography. (c) to develop and implement a day-case tonsillectomy guideline tailored for use in our specialist centre and surrounding district general hospital. a retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who had undergone tonsillectomy between april 2021 and september 2022 and were under the age of 18 at the time of surgery. patients were also included in our analyses if they had undergone other surgical procedures concurrently, provided that the additional procedure would not have otherwise impacted the length of hospital stay, for example, adenoidectomy or grommet insertion. patients with complex medical comorbidities were not excluded. these patients are factored into the national day-case rate target of 75%. patients were operated at two hospital sites (st. mary\\u2019s hospital, chelsea and westminster hospital). bipolar, cold steel, or a hybrid technique (bipolar and cold steel) was used for all cases (based on surgeon preference at the time of surgery). data were collected from electronic patient records (cerner, oracle) entered by all clinical staff involved with patient care. reasons for postoperative admission and clinical events until discharge were noted. postoperative complications, including re-admission rate and re-attendance to the hospital within 14 days of the procedure were recorded. two separate subgroup analyses were conducted of high-risk patients. subgroup a included patients aged two years at the time of surgery and weighing 12-15 kg. subgroup b included patients with severe osa on preoperative polysomnography (figure osa = obstructive sleep apnoea a total of 180 patients were initially listed for tonsillectomy. in total, 66 patients were excluded as tonsillectomy was not performed. a total of 117 patients were included in the final analyses. median age was four (range = 2-15 years old) with 62% male (n = 72). overall, 46 patients had associated comorbidities, with asthma (n = 12), prematurity (n = 7), autistic spectrum disorder (n = 6), and trisomy 21 (n = 4) being the most prevalent. in total, 90 patients underwent tonsillectomy for osa/sdb, 13 for a combination of osa/sdb and recurrent tonsillitis, 13 for recurrent tonsillitis in the absence of osa/sdb, and one patient underwent tonsillectomy to obtain histology. of those in the osa/sdb subgroup, 68% (n = 70) had a preoperative sleep study. same-day discharge rate 26%. in total, 86 patients were admitted postoperatively. forty-four required overnight oxygen saturation monitoring, 35 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile), and seven for poor oral intake postoperatively. of those admitted overnight, 81% (n = 70) remained clinically well and did not require medical input. overall, 88% (n = 76) were discharged the following day. eighteen patients returned to ed within 14 days of discharge: eight for pain, five due to poor oral intake, three for pyrexia, and two for post-tonsillectomy bleeding. both patients who returned with post-tonsillectomy bleeding were managed conservatively and discharged the following day (table osa = obstructive sleep apnoea; sdb = sleep-disordered breathing subgroup a of the 117 patients included in the analysis, 17 met the criteria. in total, 11 patients were male. the mean weight was 13.4 kg. overall, 16 patients had no comorbidities. one patient had a genetic disease ( subgroup b a total of 34 patients met the inclusion criteria. the median age was four years old (68% male). overall, 94% (n = 32) had concurrent adenoidectomy. all patients were admitted postoperatively: 18 for overnight oxygen saturation monitoring and 16 for extremes of weight (<12 kg and two years old, <15 kg and three years old or >91st centile). overall, 79% (n = 27) remained clinically well and did not require medical input overnight. four had a single transient oxygen desaturation that recovered spontaneously, occurring at 6-12 hours (n = 1), 12-18 hours (n = 2), and >24 hours (n = 1) after surgery. two had desaturations that required oxygen supplementation (both within four hours after surgery); these patients had associated comorbidities, asthma and trisomy 21, respectively. both were off oxygen within 12 hours. one primary bleed occurred that was managed conservatively. in total, 31 (91%) patients were discharged the next day. binary logistic regression logistic regression analysis was conducted to ascertain if age, weight, sex, or procedure time could be predictors for the need for supplementary oxygen or length of stay (more than one night). the model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (nagelkerke r our study evaluated the outcomes of 117 paediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy, either as a standalone procedure or in conjunction with other surgeries. the overall same-day discharge rate observed was 26%. when excluding patients from subgroup a and subgroup b, the same-day discharge rate increased to 40%. the majority of patients who required overnight admission remained stable and were discharged the following day. the current national average for same-day discharges following tonsillectomy in specialist trusts is 55% [ in total, 18 patients returned within 14 days post-surgery, with the majority (n = 13) presenting due to postoperative pain. this is higher (11% vs. 0.3%) than the rates reported at other specialist trusts with a day-case rate of <50% [ weight under 15 kg was previously associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. the ent uk consensus statement in 2009 advised that children under the age of two or three and weighing less than 15 kg should be referred onwards for consideration of tonsillectomy at regional centres [ similarly, it was also thought that children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for severe osa had an increased risk of postoperative complications. however, the incidence of major respiratory complications was no greater in children undergoing tonsillectomy for osa compared to those having adenotonsillectomy for non-osa indications [ the binary logistic model predicting desaturation requiring oxygen did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.114), suggesting that the selected variables (age, weight, total operative time, and sex) were not predictors of this desaturation within our cohort. despite the lack of overall model significance, weight approached significance (p = 0.071) with an odds ratio of 0.468. this trend, while not statistically significant, aligns with clinical observations that children with lower weight are at an increased risk of postoperative respiratory complications [ limitations referrals to our tertiary centre are received from west london and surrounding areas, as well as across south west england. our electronic health records are integrated across seven hospitals in west london, three of which provide paediatric emergency services. patients presenting with postoperative complications outside our catchment area are advised to attend their nearest emergency department with otolaryngology out-of-hours coverage. consequently, such data may not have been captured, potentially contributing to a lower post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage rate compared to national reports. additionally, this study was retrospective in design and involved a small sample size due to the reduced level of operating during the covid-19 pandemic, which limits the generalisability of the findings. a multicentre study would have been beneficial when looking at the impact covid-19 was having on day-case tonsillectomies across the united kingdom. the use of binary logistic regression analysis in this context may not fully capture the variability and complexity of the population, thereby affecting the robustness and applicability of the results to a broader patient cohort. the findings of this study provide some of the first insights into the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomy during the covid-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre. while the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, the majority of patients, including those in high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours. future work will focus on a prospective study measuring outcomes following the implementation of our day-case guidelines that standardised analgesic regimens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

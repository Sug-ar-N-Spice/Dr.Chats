The substantial volume of these operations underscores their considerable impact on healthcare systems and resource allocation. Recent guidelines in the United Kingdom have emphasized the safety and feasibility of performing tonsillectomies as day-case surgeries. The interplay of medical necessity, high incidence, and evolving guidelines underscores the importance of continually evaluating and optimizing tonsillectomy practices. This study assesses the outcomes of paediatric tonsillectomies at a UK tertiary centre during the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of day-case guidelines. Methodology A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients under 18 years of age who underwent tonsillectomy between April 2021 and September 2022. Data on postoperative events until discharge and re-attendance within 14 days were recorded. High-risk subgroups were analysed: subgroup A (two years of age and weighing 12-15 kg), and subgroup B (severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on polysomnography defined as an apnoea/hypopnoea index >30 events per hour). Binary logistic regression assessed whether age, weight, sex, or procedure time predicted extended hospital stay (more than one night) or the need for oxygen. Day-case tonsillectomy guidelines were created after multi-disciplinary team approval. Results A total of 117 patients underwent tonsillectomy, with a median age of four (n = 72 male). OSA/sleep-disordered breathing accounted for 88% (n = 103), and 68% (n = 70) underwent a preoperative sleep study. Same-day discharge rate was 26% (n = 31). Postoperatively, 86 patients were admitted; 44 required overnight oxygen saturation monitoring, 35 for weight extremes, and seven for poor oral intake. Of those admitted, 70 (81%) patients remained well overnight, and 76 (88%) patients were discharged the next day. In subgroup A (n = 17), the average weight was 13.4 kg; two had transient desaturations. Fourteen were discharged the next day. In subgroup B (n = 34), four had transient desaturations with a further two requiring oxygen. Weight (p = 0.071) within the \\u2018extended hospital stay model\\u2019 and procedure time (p = 0.052) within the \\u2018need for oxygen\\u2019 model approached significance for predicting outcomes. Conclusions This study offers early insights into paediatric tonsillectomy outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary centre. Although the same-day discharge rate was lower than the national average, most patients, including high-risk groups, remained clinically stable and were discharged within 24 hours.\",\n          \"Many patients are prescribed loop diuretics without a diagnostic record of heart failure. Little is known about their characteristics and prognosis. Glasgow regional health records (2009\\u201316) were obtained for adults with cardiovascular disease or taking loop diuretics. Outcomes were investigated using Cox models with hazard ratios adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbid disease (adjHR). Of 198 898 patients (median age 65 years; 55% women), 161 935 (81%) neither took loop diuretics nor had a diagnostic record of heart failure (reference group), 23 963 (12%) were taking loop diuretics but had no heart failure recorded, 7844 (4%) had heart failure recorded and took loop diuretics, and 5156 (3%) had heart failure recorded but were not receiving loop diuretics. Compared to the reference group, five-year mortality was only slightly higher for heart failure in the absence of loop diuretics [22%; adjHR 1.2 (95% CI 1.1\\u20131.3)], substantially higher for those taking loop diuretics with no record of heart failure [40%; adjHR 1.8 (95% CI 1.7\\u20131.8)], and highest for heart failure treated with loop diuretics [52%; adjHR 2.2 (95% CI 2.0\\u20132.2)]. For patients with cardiovascular disease, many are prescribed loop diuretics without a recorded diagnosis of heart failure. Mortality is more strongly associated with loop diuretic use than with a record of heart failure. The diagnosis of heart failure may be often missed, or loop diuretic use is associated with other conditions with a prognosis similar to heart failure, or inappropriate loop diuretic use increases mortality; all might be true. \\n\",\n          \"Intervention for severe aortic stenosis (AS) has dramatically progressed since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Decades ago, controversies existed regarding comparing clinical outcomes between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in various risk profiles. Recently, we discussed the durability of transcatheter heart valves and their lifetime management after aortic valve replacement (AVR). Regarding the management of AS, we discuss the appropriate timing of intervention for severe aortic stenosis, especially in asymptomatic patients. In spite of dramatic progression of intervention for AS, there are no established medications available to prevent or slow the progression of AS at present. Basic research and genome studies have suggested several targets associated with the progression of aortic valve calcification.

DMDs can broadly be classified into three main categories Those designed to provide more efficiently managed healthcare services\\u2014such as electronic prescribing or triaging systems; those that support people in the self-management of their health and wellness\\u2014such as communication channels between patients and healthcare professionals, health-promoting information or advice on self-management, electronic diaries, etc.; those used to diagnose, monitor, and treat health conditions, as well as to inform about disease context and care options\\u2014this for example includes digital therapeutics directly treating a distinct aspect of the disease, or digital diagnostics used to support clinical decision-making. This review draws on narrative review method, that is best suited to provide a comprehensive overview of a complex and interdisciplinary topic and to provoke further reflection on a broader subject of interest The inequities in the adoption of DMDs documented among social groups reflect those that exist in terms of health outcomes and quality of healthcare received. In all cases, poorer outcomes are found among the most socially disadvantaged communities. While it has been well noted that early adopters of digital innovations are in general those with higher economic, educational and social capital, When engaging with the issue of inequities in the access to, use of and engagement with DMDs, it is vital to not only consider socioeconomic, gender, or ethnic inequities in isolation, but also to explore how inequities are mutually reinforcing or intersecting between gender and socioeconomic position, Clinical trials are considered to provide the most robust evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and efficiency of (digital) health interventions. The results of these studies therefore need to be applicable and generalizable to an increasingly diverse population. However, multiple studies have now shown that racial and ethnic communities, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, undocumented migrants as well as older people have been underrepresented, misrepresented or made entirely invisible in clinical trials, health datasets, and research studies in general, Some of the potential mechanisms that underpin the underrepresentation of disadvantaged population groups in clinical trials and other healthcare and population health research initiatives are thought to be the lack of awareness of research initiatives by disadvantaged communities, limited opportunities for participation, logistical reasons (e.g. cost, transportation, device and internet availability, or time commitment), as well as higher levels of mistrust in science, medical professionals and the health system as a whole. A hypothetical DAG that highlights the interconnectedness of factors influencing participation and attrition rates of socially disadvantaged communities in clinical trials of DMDs. The use of real-world evidence from routine healthcare procedures offers a great opportunity as it comes with fewer limitations compared to the challenges in the recruitment and retention of diverse populations in clinical trials. One of the biggest concerns in implementing DMDs is the socio-ethical implications of their application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods and consequently, their potential to have a negative effect on underserved populations. Algorithmic bias might emerge from data collection through incomplete or unrepresentative data. In some countries, such as France and Germany, data on racial and ethnic minorities is not recorded. On the other hand, AI bias might arise during model development such as through inaccurate assumptions about the causal relationships between different parameters included in the model. A large body of evidence has now reported gender and racial biases as a consequence of AI applications across a range of health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, as well as mental and maternal health. Despite the increase in the awareness of such biases in AI and ML, more work is needed to bring transparency to AI algorithms in order to make possible the effective scrutiny of the assumptions at the heart of the models. The growing availability and use of digital tools, such as wearables, and monitoring systems enable the collection of a wide range of data via GPS tracking, Bluetooth, cameras and voice recording. This provides a novel opportunity to gather, store, share, and analyze vast amounts of health data across an individual's lifespan. It allows for continuously collect valuable patient information on health behaviors such as diet, heart rate, movement or sleep patterns, which could benefit different healthcare actors such as healthcare professionals, patients and healthcare commissioners. Importantly, these tools offer the potential to reduce health disparities by providing underserved populations with greater access to healthcare services and by offering personalized interventions via AI-driven risk stratification. Data collected through digital tools and their metadata can provide quick and objective information about human behaviors and interactions: where the individuals are located, with whom they are interacting, and for how long. In the healthcare context, the data available through the linkage of a wide range of DMDs could be used to stratify patients based on certain risk scores using data from medical or even non-medical contexts (patients\\u2019 social connectedness, socioeconomic position, etc.). Using these risk scores, healthcare providers could then decide whether to offer further treatment or prevention programs. Hogle (2016), for instance, gives a real-world example of a health insurance company that uses a \\u201cdrug adherence index\\u201d to identify noncompliant patients (or those at risk of noncompliance) based on the behavior within a given prescribed medicine protocol. Since a patient's socioeconomic circumstances is determinant of non-adherence to medication, As outlined above, the datafication of health can present both opportunities and challenges. Further research is required to better comprehend how individuals from socially advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds can equally benefit from the data collected through continuous surveillance. Data from the DMDs should be user-friendly, offering easy-to-read information to prevent information overload or misinterpretation. Risk-benefit analyses need to be complemented with research on individual attitudes and preferences for the treatment and usage of their health data from multiple sources. Additionally, using privacy-preserving techniques and well-built data infrastructures, researchers may be able to leverage health information contained within health data without the need to access personal data. Privacy, confidentiality and trust are fundamental values defined by the oath of Hippocrates and comprise an essential part of medical ethics and professional regulations. The issue of privacy due to the digitalization of medicine is complex and multi-faceted and entails respecting the individual's right to manage the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information. Trust in DMDs typically refers to the level of beliefs and confidence that individuals have in the technical aspects of data usage in terms of accuracy, reliability or data security, as well as the assurance that the system will provide benefits without causing harm. Another closely related issue affecting trust in DMDs concerns the extent to which the users are privacy literate and know how to effectively understand and protect the privacy of the digital information they allow these technologies to collect. Although distinct, digital literacy and privacy literacy go hand in hand and as such might disproportionally affect socially disadvantaged populations. Depending on how DMDs are designed, deployed and integrated into the healthcare systems, they can exacerbate or potentially alleviate health inequities by reaching and serving underserved communities. To achieve the latter, we suggest a range of individual, organizational (e.g. academia, healthcare, industry) and national level recommendations, summarized in  Multilevel recommendations for the advancement of equity across different socio-ethical challenges in digital medicine. To ensure equitable access, use, and adherence to DMDs, efforts should be made to create an inclusive digital health ecosystem by providing internet access, and affordable equipment, complemented by financial, technical, and social support for those in need.To raise awareness about clinical trials through culturally appropriate outreach and incentives like transportation costs and childcare should be offered to research participants. Additionally, efforts should be made to identify and address algorithm bias in AI and to enhance literacy related to data privacy and security. Organizations should adopt participatory design approaches in developing DMDs, focusing on the inclusion of diverse populations. They should continuously monitor disparities in DMD access and use and ensure that trials include and retain participants from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, providing necessary instructions on the use of digital technologies and user-friendly feedback on the collected data. In addition, oversampling of underrepresented populations and transparency in data reporting should be rigorously implemented. Collaborations between AI researchers and social scientists should be fostered to ensure fairness and transparency in AI applications. Organizations must implement security infrastructure to protect health data and design privacy-preserving DMDs by principle. National policies should integrate equity considerations in health technology assessments, promote sustainable digital health business models, and ensure continuous monitoring of DMD inequities in access to, use of, and engagement with DMDs as well as fair health outcomes associated with their use. Standards for including underrepresented populations in research should be developed, along with guidelines for addressing algorithm bias in AI. A clear ethical framework for health data use should be established, with investments in federated data approaches to enhance transparency and trust in digital health systems. While some critics of the narrative review argue that it might lead to the selective use of evidence to support a particular point, this is balanced by the fact that the selection of literature was guided by how pertinent the evidence was to important policy questions that aid decision-makers. Equity as a lens can shed light on a range of socio-ethical challenges and opportunities linked to the development and deployment of DMDs in the healthcare system and in the wider society. Although not exhaustive, the five socio-ethical considerations discussed in this article underscore the importance of a critical examination and reflection, prompting consideration of potential socio-ethical challenges that may emerge in the current trend of developing data-driven innovations. While digital medicine offers a promising new avenue to optimize healthcare outcomes through the development of robust evidenced-based interventions\\u2014and thus improving clinical decision-making, addressing the socio-ethical implications of their use is essential to advance health equity.

These cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Patient-derived tumor cell lines were established and maintained in a serum-free culture medium that included epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor, as detailed in our previous study [ Cord blood (CB) cells were sourced from the Kinki Cord Blood Bank and Hyogo Cord Blood Bank, after obtaining informed consent. The conduct of this study was approved by the institutional review boards of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Kinki Cord Blood Bank, and Hyogo Cord Blood Bank. Six-week-old male NOD/Shi-scid IL2R\\u03b3null (NOG) mice were purchased from the Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Kawasaki, Japan. The conduct of animal experiments was sanctioned by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Osaka University Medical School (Approval numbers 03\\u2013071-000 and 04\\u2013028-002). All animal-related procedures were performed in strict adherence to the guidelines of the Animal Experiment Committee at Osaka University. To assess the expression of B7-H3 on the surface of the target cell line, cells were stained with an anti-B7-H3 antibody (MIH42; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA, RRID: AB_10720987) in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% FBS at 4\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 30\\u00a0min.

Following another washing step, the cells were analyzed using a BD FACS Canto II, BD FACS Celesta, or FACS Aria II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Flow cytometry data were processed using the FlowJo software (BD Biosciences, RRID: SCR_008520). The antibodies utilized for staining included anti-CD3 Cy7PE (UCHT1; BioLegend, RRID: AB_439781), anti-CD56 PE (HCD56; BioLegend, RRID: AB_604101), and goat antihuman F(ab')2 Alexa Fluor 647 (109\\u2013607-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA, RRID: AB_2337903). Cetuximab (Merck Biopharma, Darmstadt, Germany), targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was biotinylated using the Biotin Labeling Kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for staining purposes.

The selected target sequence was AGTGCCACCACTGGGTCTTC. A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex was prepared by combining crRNA, tracrRNA (IDT, catalog no. 1072533), and TrueCut Cas9 protein V2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

(Rockville, MD, USA). As a control, we also created CAR-T cells targeting CD19 using the reported sequences of an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody [ Activated T cells were then subjected to retroviral transduction with the B7-H3 CAR construct. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a single donor were initially activated using anti-CD3 (OKT3; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA; RRID: AB_468854) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2; eBioscience; RRID: AB_468926) antibodies and cultured in X-VIVO 15 medium (LONZA, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 5% human serum AB (GeminiBio, West Sacramento, CA, USA).

The duration of in vivo persistence of CAR-NK cells has been reported to be shorter than that of CAR-T cells [ In conclusion, CB-derived B7-H3 CAR-NK cells demonstrated an antitumor effect against GBM in a xenograft model generated with patient-derived GBM cells, although more detailed analysis of the B7-H3 CAR-NK cells and their improvement are needed in the future.\",\n          \"Major spine surgery causes severe postoperative pain, which is often difficult to treat. Considering the nature of the surgery, the goal is to tailor the multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic regimen for these patients with stable hemodynamic effects, effective intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, and early recovery with minimal side effects. To deal with severe postoperative pain, systemic analgesics, and epidural and paravertebral blocks have been tried, and their adverse effects and complications impose a concern [ A novel inter-fascial erector spinae plane\\u00a0(ESP) block was introduced to treat thoracic neuropathic pain [ The extensive cranial-caudal spread is a unique advantage of the ESP block,\\u00a0it can be performed at a distance from the surgical field. Furthermore, the observed lack of hindrance in intraoperative\\u00a0electrophysiologic monitoring and the absence of a motor block that might affect postoperative neurologic testing and mobilization are the additional potential advantages of the ESP block\\u00a0[ The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of the ESP block on perioperative pain management in terms of its effect on the fentanyl requirement in the intraoperative period and tramadol usage in the first 24 hours of the postoperative period in lumbosacral spine surgery. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of ESP block on intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative NRS scores, and the time to the first\\u00a0rescue analgesia. This was a single-center, quasi-experimental study conducted by the Department of Anesthesiology over 18 months, after obtaining approval from the institutional human ethics committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal,\\u00a0with project ID: MD0048 (IHEC-LOP/2019/MD0048). We included 66 patients between 18 and 65 years of age of either sex belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1 to 3 undergoing elective/emergency lumbosacral spine surgery. Written and informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. Participants were allocated into two groups using a quasi-experimental methodology: (1) Group GA: Each patient received standard general anesthesia alone;\\u00a0(2) Group GA + ESP: Each patient received standard general anesthesia plus pre-incisional ultra-sound-guided bilateral erector spinae plane block.\\u00a0 Exclusion criteria were refusal to block, contraindications to regional technique, e.g., allergy to local anesthetic drugs, infection around the site of block, coagulation disorder, sepsis, pregnancy, and physical or mental health disorders. All participants received Tab. alprazolam\\u00a00.25 mg\\u00a0the night before and on the morning of surgery along with Tab. pantoprazole\\u00a040 mg\\u00a0with a sip of water in the morning. In the operation theater, an intravenous (IV) line using an 18-G cannula was established, and standard monitoring, including non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and capnography, was applied and assessed continuously.\\u00a0 After induction of general anesthesia, participants in the GA+ESP group were given an ESP block in the lateral position under ultrasound guidance. A high-frequency linear transducer (7-13 MHz) of the Sonosite M-Turbo ultrasound machine (Fujifilm, Bothell,\\u00a0WA, US) was placed 3 cm lateral to the vertebral column longitudinally. The transverse processes of the T12 vertebra, the erector spinae, and the psoas muscles were identified (Figure  ESM: erector spinae muscle; TP: transverse process, PVS: paravertebral space,\\u00a0Cr: cranial, Ca: caudal, A: anterior, P: posterior Depending on the depth, a 22G ultrasound needle of either 5 or 8cm was inserted through the in-plane technique in a craniocaudal direction until contact was made with the top of the transverse process. After a slight retraction of the needle, normal saline was injected for hydro-dissection to identify the plane, and then 20 ml of 0.25% Inj. levobupivacaine was injected behind the erector spinae muscle (Figure  Cr: cranial, Ca: caudal, A: anterior, P: posterior, TP: transverse process, LA: local anesthetic The same process was repeated on the other side (total dose not exceeding >3 mg/kg).\\u00a0Sensory loss of the posterior dermatomes and dermatomes of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves (lumbar plexus, upper leg) was examined by the blinded examiner every 5 min till 30 min following the block. The patient was observed for any vascular injury, localized swelling, hypotension, and block failure. All patients were pre-medicated with IV midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and IV fentanyl 1 mic/kg 3 min before the induction of anesthesia. Preoxygenation with FiO2 of 1 was followed by induction with IV propofol 2 mg/kg, once ventilation was ensured, the intubation of the trachea with 7.5 mm ID ET tube was facilitated with IV vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg\\u00a0and followed by a maintenance dose\\u00a0every 30 minutes. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide with 40% FiO2. Standard hemodynamic monitoring was done and IV fentanyl 0.5 ug/kg was administered if heart rate, blood pressure, or both increased more than 20% of the baseline. Anesthesia was reversed with IV neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg\\u00a0plus IV glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg, and the trachea was extubated after ensuring an adequate tidal volume and regular spontaneous breathing. Participants were shifted to the post-anesthesia care unit for hemodynamic and numeric rating scale (NRS) score monitoring [ Statistical analysis To detect the mean difference in cumulative analgesia dose of medium effect size with a type 1 error of 5% and power of 80% for the unpaired t-test, we estimated a sample size of 30 in each group. A master sheet was created in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, US) with the parameters that were measured in the study. Statistical analysis was done on SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US). Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests were done to check whether the numerical parameters were distributed normally. Ordinal parameters were compared between the GA and GA+ESP groups using the chi-square and Fisher\\u2019s exact tests, and parametric data comparisons were done using an unpaired student\\u2019s t-test. Non-parametric numerical parameters were compared using the independent samples' Mann-Whitney U test. A two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to see the effect of group and time on NRS scores and intraoperative hemodynamic parameters. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were done with Bonferroni correction at different time points within the group as well as between the groups. Plotting was done using SPSS version 24 and MATLAB R2018b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, US). p<0.05 was considered significant. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagram is shown in Figure  A comparison of NRS scores in the postoperative period at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours between the two study groups was done. The median time for the first systemic rescue analgesia was significantly later in the GA+ESP group as compared to the GA group (8 hr vs 2 hr, p-value <0.00925). The NRS scores were significantly higher in the GA group as compared to the GA+ESP group at all time points measured (Figure  Intraoperative heart rate and BP showed a reduction at some time points in the GA+ESP group, but\\u00a0no hemodynamic instability was observed with the use of the block. There were no significant differences in the postoperative day of the first mobilization and duration of hospital stay in the two groups. No block-related complications were noticed. The two groups were not significantly different in baseline heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The primary outcome parameter of intraoperative fentanyl usage was higher in the GA group as compared to the GA+ESP group (66.7% vs 16.7%, p-value <0.000085), and the postoperative tramadol requirement\\u00a0was higher in the GA group than in the GA+ESP group (73.3% vs 20%, p-value <0.00182) (Table  n = number In this study, most of the GA+ESP group participants receiving a bilateral USG-guided ESP block at the T12 level had low NRS scores compared to the GA group patients at all the time points measured (0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 hr). The ESP block provided a good analgesic effect extending to the postoperative period, thereby reducing opioid consumption in the intraoperative as well as the postoperative period, delaying the time for first systemic rescue analgesia\\u00a0[ Cadaveric studies revealed that when the local anesthetic is injected deep into the erector spinae muscle, a significant spread of the drug occurs involving the blockade of the dorsal and ventral rami of multiple spinal nerves, thus resulting in sympathetic, visceral, and somatic nerve blocks with a large dermatomal distribution [ Clinical studies have shown that ESP block has been associated with improved analgesic effects in trauma, neuropathies, and postoperative analgesic profiles in breast surgeries, thoracotomies, hip and femur surgeries, ventral hernia repairs, abdominal hysterectomies, thus allowing its usage in a wide range of clinical scenarios at various vertebral levels\\u00a0[ Lumbar spine surgeries are more invasive with severe postoperative pain, especially on the first postoperative day\\u00a0[ Few clinical studies have been conducted so far to know the efficacy of erector spinae plane block in spine surgeries. In a similar study with a ropivacaine-based ESP block, there was decreased perioperative opioid usage, enhanced emergence from anesthesia, and early ambulation after surgery [ In this study, there was no significant difference in the postop day of first mobilization and duration of hospital stay between the two study groups. This is in contrast to\\u00a0the improved mobilization and reduced hospital stays seen in some previously reported case series\\u00a0[ The sham block is considered for internal validity in terms of blinding, thereby reducing the element of bias. In our study, we have not used a sham block, as injecting an inert substance with no therapeutic value would be considered unethical and expose the patient to unwanted complications [ The limitations of our study\\u00a0were: we did not use a sham intervention in the GA group, as operating surgeons were apprehensive about the sham procedure\\u00a0and patients were given a single shot injection of local anesthetic rather than a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses by placing a\\u00a0catheter.\\u00a0The diversity of the surgical procedure can be a confounding factor for the study. The institutional ethics committee also did not allow us to randomize this study.

The trial was conducted from June 2022 to April 2023; nine clinical research sites in Japan enrolled participants (see list of Investigators in\\n Tomomi Hakoda Nippon Kokan Fukuyama Hospital Fukuyama, Japan Satoshi Kuroyanagi Kishiwada Tokushu-Kai Hospital Osaka, Japan Yoshimitsu Yamasaki Kyosokai AMC NISHI-UMEDA Clinic Osaka, Japan Kenshi Fujii Sakurabashi Watanabe Hospital Osaka, Japan Atsushi Sueyoshi Uji Tokushu-Kai Hospital Osaka, Japan Akitaka Nakata Sanai Hospital Saitama, Japan Fumiki Oh Shinden Higashi Clinic Sendai, Japan Tatsushi Sugiura Soka-Sugiura Clinic Soka, Japan Toshiyuki Sugiura Sugiura Clinic Tokyo, Japan \\nParticipants included Japanese men and women (not pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant) that were 18-80 years of age who had not achieved treatment goals in accordance with the 2022 Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for Prevention of ASCVD Participants were randomized using an automated interactive response technology system in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: one 2.5 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, one 5 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet per day, or one matching placebo tablet per day, for an 8-week treatment period. Randomization was stratified according to screening LDL-C level of ≥ 100 or ＜100 mg/dL. Following randomization, participants were evaluated at the clinic at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (end of treatment) for efficacy, safety, and PK assessments, and at week 12 for final safety and PK assessments. During the 8-week treatment period, participants were instructed to take the study drugs orally once daily at approximately the same time each morning, and to bring all their study drug supply to the site at the clinic visits, where compliance was evaluated by counting unused tablets. The investigators, participants, clinical research organization, and sponsor of the trial were blinded to all lipid results from randomization until all participants had completed the final treatment visit and the database was locked. \\nFasting blood samples were collected at each clinic visit throughout the trial. Testing was completed by Medpace Reference Laboratories (Singapore) who performed the clinical laboratory analyses, and Medpace Bioanalytic Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH, USA) who performed the PK sample analysis as described previously The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline to week 8 in Friedewald-calculated LDL-C for each obicetrapib group compared with placebo. Secondary and other efficacy endpoints included apoB, non-HDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL-C, apoE, and TG. Safety and tolerability endpoints included clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and adverse events. A sample size of at least 100 evaluable participants (25 per treatment group) was expected to provide more than 90% power to detect a 30% difference in LDL-C reduction at week 8 (standard deviation of 25%) for each of the obicetrapib treatment groups compared to placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. A total of 102 subjects were randomized. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The primary analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, i.e., all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were also conducted in a per protocol population (all participants in the ITT population with LDL-C measured at baseline and week 8, and with no major protocol deviations). The PK analysis was performed in all participants in the ITT population assigned to one of the three obicetrapib dose groups who had sufficient blood samples collected for valid estimation of PK parameters, and the safety analyses were completed in all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug. The analysis of the percent change from baseline to end of treatment in Friedewald-calculated LDL-C (the primary endpoint) was performed with a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach using SAS® Proc Mixed. The analysis included fixed effects for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, and the baseline value as a continuous covariate. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood estimation approach was used with an unstructured covariance matrix. Least squares (LS) means, standard errors (SE), and two-sided 95% confidence intervals for each treatment group and for the pairwise comparisons of each dose of obicetrapib to the placebo group were determined, and the LS means for the pairwise comparison and its SE were used for the hypothesis testing. To maintain the overall alpha level on the primary endpoint, the hypothesis testing was performed sequentially at the two-sided alpha=0.05 significance level. The first comparison was the 10 mg obicetrapib group vs. placebo; if significant, the comparison of the 5 mg group vs. placebo was performed next followed by the 2.5 mg group vs. placebo. Hypothesis testing proceeded in this hierarchical step-down fashion until a comparison was not significant at which point the remaining sequential tests were deemed not significant. The MMRM model included all available assessments of percent change in LDL-C from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 8. The model assumed the data were missing at random. Missing data were not imputed for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis; for other analyses, the model implicitly estimated missing data by assuming they followed the same distribution as observed data conditioned on baseline value and changes over time. Similar MMRM models as described for the primary endpoint were used to analyze the secondary and other efficacy endpoints, but without adjustment for multiplicity. Nominal p-values are provided when applicable. Normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Three sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population: MMRM with imputation, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with fixed effects of treatment group and baseline LDL-C value as a continuous covariate, and LDL-C by preparative ultracentrifugation. Safety and PK analyses were summarized descriptively; no statistical inference was applied to these endpoints. \\nAll of the 102 randomized subjects completed the treatment and safety/PK follow-up periods and were included in the primary analyses  ITT defined as all randomized participants; safety defined as all participants who received at least one dose of any study drug; PK defined as all participants in the ITT population who had sufficient blood samples collected for valid estimation of PK parameters; PP defined as all participants in ITT population who had baseline and week 8 LDL-C values and no major protocol deviation that potentially impacted the primary efficacy endpoint.

Maximum doses of all statins, except pitavastatin, approved for use in Japan are lower than those in other countries, including the U.S., due to increased risk for statin-associated muscle symptoms in persons of Asian ancestry \\nThe significant increase in plasma apoE with obicetrapib (+26.3% at the 10 mg dose) also has potential clinical relevance to ASCVD risk reduction, as well as to Alzheimer’s Disease \\nAs expected, the results of the safety analyses showing obicetrapib to be safe and well tolerated in this current study of obicetrapib were consistent with previous reports from trials in predominantly non-Japanese participants as well as in the subgroup of healthy male Japanese patients enrolled in a single ascending dose investigation of obicetrapib, which found no effect of ethnicity on safety, PK, or pharmacodynamic effects \\nAlthough this trial was limited by its relatively small sample size and short treatment period, it was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on lipids. Another potential limitation of this study was that it did not measure the effects of obicetrapib on the concentrations of lipoprotein particles or lipoprotein(a) among Japanese subjects. In the Study to Evaluate the Effect of Obicetrapib in Combination with Ezetimibe as an Adjunct to High Intensity Statin Therapy, 10 mg obicetrapib in combination with 10 mg ezetimibe significantly reduced total and small LDL particles by 72% and 95%, respectively, and altered the HDL profile in a manner suggesting it increased cholesterol flux through the HDL fraction This study demonstrated the lipid-modifying efficacy, safety, and PK profile of obicetrapib in Japanese men and women with dyslipidemia and supports the continued global investigation of obicetrapib for reducing dyslipidemia and preventing ASCVD.

A diagnosis of AIDS is based on a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of <200 and/or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness. The rapid progression of HIV to AIDS can be due to poor treatment adherence [ The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a past medical history of Monkeypox, COVID-19, HIV, and syphilis. She also has a past psychiatric history of MDD, anxiety, and polysubstance abuse.\\xa0She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year prior and denied taking any medication for either. She presented to the behavioral hospital on an involuntary admission for two weeks. The patient was brought in by police after she was found wandering and incoherent on the street. A drug test on admission was positive for marijuana and cocaine. The patient admitted to regular alcohol use. A week after admission, the patient has been complaining of foul-smelling, watery diarrhea\\xa0and severe, diffuse abdominal pain for the past one week. She was seen by the hospitalist on duty in the behavioral hospital. She denied any nausea, vomiting, or other related symptoms. The patient was then diagnosed with Gastroenteritis. The patient is homeless and admitted to being aware of her HIV diagnosis for two years. She also stated that she had not been to a physician for “a while”. The patient states that she is unaware of any family history. She was prescribed Biktarvy when she was first diagnosed but couldn’t recall the specific dosage or the last time she took her medication. The patient also stated that she’d had a self-resolving bout of similar symptoms a few months ago. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 97/79 mmHg, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, temperature of 97.7 Fahrenheit, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented but in obvious distress. No psychometric tests were conducted. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities: Abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation. She had a negative pregnancy test and had not received any recent imaging. Laboratory values revealed that her CD4 count was 2, bicarbonate was 21, and chloride was 111 (Table  The patient was diagnosed with AIDS due to her CD4 count<200 and AIDS-defining illness. The complex treatment plan for this patient included management of both psychiatric and medical diagnoses. Upon admission, the patient was given diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and haloperidol for agitation. While on admission, her acute gastroenteritis was treated with ciprofloxacin and oral hydration, with imodium for symptomatic relief. Her AIDS treatment required adherence to her current regimen of Biktarvy daily [ BID: twice a day; IM: intramuscular; Q6H: every six hours; Q2H: every two hours; PRN: as needed; mg: milligrams; mL: milliliters. During hospitalization, she received group therapy along with other patients four times a week. On day 12 of admission, the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain were resolved.\\xa0The patient was discharged from the behavioral hospital once her two-week hold was completed. She was given a prescription for continuation of Lexapro and hydroxyzine pamoate, at the same dosage, to manage her psychiatric diagnoses and Bactrim for continued prophylaxis against AIDS-defining illnesses. Prior to discharge, she was offered the help of a social worker in housing placement in a local rehab/shelter and a one-week follow-up. Unfortunately, upon discharge, the patient was lost to follow up. The patient’s eventual outcome is unknown. The major challenges allowing for progression of this patient’s condition to AIDS include her homelessness, prior mental health diagnoses, and healthcare access. Her paralleled engagement in acute healthcare without adherence to long-term treatment regimens may indicate a lack of understanding regarding her diagnosis and dosage, a more potent non-adherence risk when coupled with her other social determinants (homelessness, loss to follow-up, and stigmatized diagnoses). In such cases, a further understanding is needed of the effects of the individual’s MDD and anxiety diagnoses on her memory, behavior, and comprehension [ Present literature\\xa0indicates that proper comprehension of diagnoses is demonstrated by a knowledge of their relationship to other conditions, and the unambiguous effects of the treatment plan [ True patient-centered care involves consideration of all detrimental and common effects of a patient’s comorbidities\\xa0and a consideration of their other health determinants, socioeconomic status, for example. The efficacy of a physician in situations requiring both long and short-term patient care is contingent on the physician’s ability to examine, account for, and appreciate every facet of the individual directly and indirectly linked to their presentation as a patient.\\xa0In this case and many others, without adequate management of mental illnesses, treatment of chronic medical conditions may have been delayed, resulting in the patient's degression into unwanted outcomes. Through an integrated approach, one which considers socioeconomic hindrances to care and inadequate treatment of psychiatric illnesses, medical diagnoses can be addressed more efficiently.\""]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df['full_text'][0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Total

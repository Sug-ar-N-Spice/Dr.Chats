11469308,Management of Gastroenteritis in an AIDS Patient With a History of Multiple Secondary Infections and Psychiatric Disorders,"This case report explores the challenges associated with the management of chronic medical diseases in patients with psychiatric disorders. The patient is a 36-year-old female patient diagnosed with AIDS, multiple secondary infections, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and polysubstance abuse. The simultaneous occurrence of both physical and mental health conditions presents unique obstacles in managing chronic medical diseases. The goal of this report is to discuss the patient's medical history, psychosocial factors, interventions, and outcomes and provide insights for future patient care. This report will also illuminate the relationship between psychiatric disorders and diminished health maintenance.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection that destroys CD4+ T lymphocyte cells, while acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the final disease stage of the original viral infection. A diagnosis of AIDS is based on a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of <200 and/or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness. The rapid progression of HIV to AIDS can be due to poor treatment adherence [ The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a past medical history of Monkeypox, COVID-19, HIV, and syphilis. She also has a past psychiatric history of MDD, anxiety, and polysubstance abuse. She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year prior and denied taking any medication for either. She presented to the behavioral hospital on an involuntary admission for two weeks. The patient was brought in by police after she was found wandering and incoherent on the street. A drug test on admission was positive for marijuana and cocaine. The patient admitted to regular alcohol use. A week after admission, the patient has been complaining of foul-smelling, watery diarrhea and severe, diffuse abdominal pain for the past one week. She was seen by the hospitalist on duty in the behavioral hospital. She denied any nausea, vomiting, or other related symptoms. The patient was then diagnosed with Gastroenteritis. The patient is homeless and admitted to being aware of her HIV diagnosis for two years. She also stated that she had not been to a physician for “a while”. The patient states that she is unaware of any family history. She was prescribed Biktarvy when she was first diagnosed but couldn’t recall the specific dosage or the last time she took her medication. The patient also stated that she’d had a self-resolving bout of similar symptoms a few months ago. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 97/79 mmHg, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, temperature of 97.7 Fahrenheit, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented but in obvious distress. No psychometric tests were conducted. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities: Abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation. She had a negative pregnancy test and had not received any recent imaging. Laboratory values revealed that her CD4 count was 2, bicarbonate was 21, and chloride was 111 (Table  The patient was diagnosed with AIDS due to her CD4 count<200 and AIDS-defining illness. The complex treatment plan for this patient included management of both psychiatric and medical diagnoses. Upon admission, the patient was given diphenhydramine, lorazepam, and haloperidol for agitation. While on admission, her acute gastroenteritis was treated with ciprofloxacin and oral hydration, with imodium for symptomatic relief. Her AIDS treatment required adherence to her current regimen of Biktarvy daily [ BID: twice a day; IM: intramuscular; Q6H: every six hours; Q2H: every two hours; PRN: as needed; mg: milligrams; mL: milliliters. During hospitalization, she received group therapy along with other patients four times a week. On day 12 of admission, the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain were resolved. The patient was discharged from the behavioral hospital once her two-week hold was completed. She was given a prescription for continuation of Lexapro and hydroxyzine pamoate, at the same dosage, to manage her psychiatric diagnoses and Bactrim for continued prophylaxis against AIDS-defining illnesses. Prior to discharge, she was offered the help of a social worker in housing placement in a local rehab/shelter and a one-week follow-up. Unfortunately, upon discharge, the patient was lost to follow up. The patient’s eventual outcome is unknown. The major challenges allowing for progression of this patient’s condition to AIDS include her homelessness, prior mental health diagnoses, and healthcare access. Her paralleled engagement in acute healthcare without adherence to long-term treatment regimens may indicate a lack of understanding regarding her diagnosis and dosage, a more potent non-adherence risk when coupled with her other social determinants (homelessness, loss to follow-up, and stigmatized diagnoses). In such cases, a further understanding is needed of the effects of the individual’s MDD and anxiety diagnoses on her memory, behavior, and comprehension [ Present literature indicates that proper comprehension of diagnoses is demonstrated by a knowledge of their relationship to other conditions, and the unambiguous effects of the treatment plan [ True patient-centered care involves consideration of all detrimental and common effects of a patient’s comorbidities and a consideration of their other health determinants, socioeconomic status, for example. The efficacy of a physician in situations requiring both long and short-term patient care is contingent on the physician’s ability to examine, account for, and appreciate every facet of the individual directly and indirectly linked to their presentation as a patient. In this case and many others, without adequate management of mental illnesses, treatment of chronic medical conditions may have been delayed, resulting in the patient's degression into unwanted outcomes. Through an integrated approach, one which considers socioeconomic hindrances to care and inadequate treatment of psychiatric illnesses, medical diagnoses can be addressed more efficiently.","['bipolar', 'depression\xa0', 'integrative medicine', 'medical compliance', 'poor adherence', 'schizophrenia']",,Cureus,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11468210,Barriers and facilitators to women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services in rural Australia: a systematic review,"Accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in rural Australia presents complex challenges that negatively impact women’s health and exacerbate health inequities across the life course. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the barriers and facilitators to women’s access to SRH services in rural Australia, considering both supply and demand dimensions. We systematically searched peer-reviewed literature published between 2013 and 2023. Search terms were derived from three major topics: (1) women living in rural Australia; (2) spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and (3) barriers or facilitators. We adopted the “best fit” approach to framework synthesis using the patient-centred access to healthcare model. Database searches retrieved 1,024 unique records, with 50 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed access to primary care services ( This review highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SRH service access disparities in rural Australia. Understanding the barriers and facilitators women face in accessing SRH services within the rural context is necessary to develop comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions informed by a nuanced understanding of rural women’s diverse needs. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11710-9.","Access to healthcare is a multifaceted indicator of healthcare system performance and equitable care provision [ Access is a complex concept, defined in spatial and aspatial terms [ 
 Patient-centred access to healthcare dimensions and determinants. (Adapted from Levesque et al. 2013 conceptual framework) [ Australia’s inequitable distribution of health services is well documented, and issues associated with access are often influenced by Australia’s vast landmass, challenging geographic environments, and sparsely distributed populations in rural areas [ Previous reviews have focused on specific types of SRH services, such as abortion services [ This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ The PICOS mnemonic was used to frame the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table  
 PICOS inclusion and exclusion criteria • Not focused on examining spatial or aspatial access. • Does not include sexual or reproductive health services 
 Types of sexual and reproductive health services in Australia • Immunisation and vaccination • Cervical screening • STI screening • Disease prevention programs • General practitioner for services such as contraception counselling, intrauterine device insertion, medical abortion prescription • Pharmacy for services such as dispensing of emergency contraception and medical abortion medicine • Community health and family planning • Referred medical specialist services, such as gynaecology, obstetrics, and fertility services • Diagnostic services • Inpatient • Outpatient clinics • Emergency department care Source: Adapted from AIHW [ A literature search was conducted on 15 November 2023, using six electronic databases: EMBASE (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Health Policy Reference Center (EBSCOhost), Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (EBSCOhost), Global Health (EBSCOhost), and MEDLINE Complete (EBSCOhost). A comprehensive list of search terms was developed from a preliminary search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and a review of relevant literature, such as SRH systematic reviews. The keywords in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used to index articles were utilised to develop the full search strategy. A combination of search terms related to the following concepts: [1] women living in rural, regional, or remote Australia; [2] spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and [3] barriers or facilitators to access. A supplementary file outlines the complete search strategies (see Supplementary file  All identified citations were collated and uploaded into Endnote (Version 20.2.1, Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA). Citations were then imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were dual-screened in Covidence by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC) using the prespecified eligibility criteria. Potentially relevant studies were retrieved as full texts and dual-assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage were recorded. Reference lists of included studies were screened for additional studies. Any reviewer disagreements during the selection process were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies by SW using Excel and tabulated with the following headings: author, year, health service setting, health discipline, context, geographic location according to MMM or ASGS-RA, population characteristics, study objective, study design, barriers, facilitators, summary of findings, study limitations, and implications. Ten per cent of the extracted data were cross-checked by another reviewer (LA). Any reviewer disagreements were resolved through discussion or with an additional reviewer. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for the appropriate study design (e.g., analytical cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, cohort studies) [ Study characteristics (e.g., barriers or facilitators, SRH service) were tabulated and synthesised narratively to describe the available evidence.

Insufficient information primarily related to gaps in the information provided by GPs around maternity care providers [ Three main barriers emerged related to women’s ability to perceive healthcare: low health literacy, limited awareness, and difficulties in navigating the health system. The barrier of low health literacy was predominantly related to cervical screening [ Two main facilitators were identified for approachability: health system improvements and enhanced education and institutional approaches. Health system improvements pertained to changes to the health system, such as providing culturally accessible information and roles for Aboriginal Health Practitioners (AHP) to work with the community and coordinate access to screening services [ Three facilitators were identified for women’s ability to perceive healthcare: information access, knowledge and awareness, and culturally appropriate information. Information access was primarily related to internet access, as this was the most common way women accessed information, and ease of access to information determined the choice of provider [ Acceptability relates to cultural and social factors that affect a woman’s ability to accept or seek health services or aspects of them. For example, the gender or social group of the provider or the beliefs associated with systems of medicine may reduce the acceptability of seeking care [ Three primary barriers were identified for acceptability: negative provider attitudes, low-quality care, and privacy concerns. Negative provider attitudes were frequently reported by women and included GPs’ unwillingness to refer for abortion services or denying care altogether, leaving women needing to locate willing providers themselves [ Three barriers were identified for women’s ability to seek healthcare: lack of cultural safety, stigma, embarrassment and perceived judgment, and community context challenges. Lack of cultural safety primarily affected maternity care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, whereby standard maternity care was not deemed culturally safe, with limited cross-cultural understanding of medical care [ Three facilitators were identified for acceptability: inclusive and culturally sensitive practices, enhanced privacy with flexible service delivery, and improved health system practices. Culturally sensitive practices involved ensuring cultural safety and consulting women on their cultural needs around birth [ The main facilitator for women’s ability to seek healthcare was related to care preferences. Birthing in the local community was reported to be a positive experience for women [ Availability and accommodation refer to the ability to access health services and healthcare providers, both physically and promptly. Availability means enough health resources to provide services, including the providers’ characteristics (e.g., presence of the health professional, qualification) and how services are delivered [ Three barriers were identified for availability and accommodation: poor local access, inadequate health service availability, and limited provider availability. Poor local access was related to the lack of and fragmented local services. For example, ultrasound or pathology services were not available at the same location as the care provider, requiring patients to travel [ Three barriers were identified that impacted a woman’s ability to reach healthcare: transportation issues, increased travel, and relocation for care. Transportation issues were particularly relevant for women without a driving licence or car, as they had to depend on public transportation or family and friends [ Facilitators identified for availability and accommodation encompassed the enhancement of local service provision and capacity, and increased resource accessibility. Strategies to enhance local service provision and capacity involved increasing their capacity [ One facilitator was identified for women’s ability to reach healthcare: time and travel efficiency. This was related to telehealth appointments [ Affordability pertains to a woman’s economic ability to allocate resources and time to necessary health services. The direct costs of services, related expenses, and the potential loss of income influence it. Affordability can differ based on the type of service and relies on the ability to acquire the resources needed to cover care costs [ Two primary barriers to affordability were identified: high direct costs and costs associated with essential products. The high direct costs identified across multiple studies included limited bulk-billing options [ Two barriers were found to hinder a woman’s ability to pay for healthcare: high travel-related costs and the financial burden of indirect costs. High travel-related costs were reported in four studies for women who were required to travel for care [ Two facilitators emerged for affordability, including cost reduction strategies, and policy and incentive support. Cost reduction strategies involved the increased use of telehealth services due to lower associated costs [ Service affordability was identified as a facilitator for women’s ability to pay for healthcare. Improving access and availability of MToP appointments and medication in rural areas was found to be much more affordable than accessing SToP [ Appropriateness refers to the overall clinical benefit for the woman and whether the expected health benefits (e.g., improved quality of life) outweigh the potential negative consequences (e.g., time, cost). Appropriateness also includes adequacy, which pertains to the quality of the type and model of services provided and their continuity [ Two barriers were found for appropriateness: limitations in telehealth accessibility and care discontinuities. The limitations in telehealth accessibility were linked to language barriers for non-English speaking women and the absence of visual cues for the visually impaired [ Two barriers were also identified for women’s ability to engage in healthcare, including a lack of support systems and psychological effects. Lack of support systems pertained to women who were required to relocate to give birth. Women who relocated experienced disconnection and distress from leaving family support and also reported inadequate caregiver support for existing children [ Two facilitators were identified for appropriateness, including telehealth accessibility and patient-centred care. One study found that the accessibility of telehealth helped to promote relationship-building with a provider before the patient was required to travel [ Thirty-nine studies (78%) were assessed using the JBI quality appraisal tool for qualitative design, while sixteen studies (32%) were evaluated using the JBI quality appraisal tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. A supplementary file includes the quality appraisal for all studies (see Supplementary file  To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesise the evidence on the spatial and aspatial barriers and facilitators that women experience in accessing SRH services in rural healthcare settings in Australia. This review highlighted significant barriers and facilitators from supply and demand access dimensions. Many of the facilitators to SRH access identified in this review relate to women’s empowerment. Empowerment refers to the ability of women to make choices and exercise agency and decision-making through expanded access to and control over resources and changes to the institutional structures that affect their lives [ Health literacy can contribute to women’s empowerment and agency by giving them the tools to access, understand, and use health information to participate in shared decision-making, which is essential for enabling patient-centred care [ Patient-centred care was a facilitator identified in the appropriateness and ability to engage dimension. Continuity of carer was identified as a significant factor in access to maternity care, also highlighted in other systematic reviews of access to antenatal care in high-income countries [ Despite emphasising patient-centred care, negative provider attitudes pose significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly accessing abortion care in rural areas. A recent scoping review highlighted the relationship between negative attitudes, abortion stigma and quality of care, contributing to the gatekeeping and obstruction of abortion access [ In addition to addressing negative provider attitudes, it is crucial to acknowledge the affordability and ability to pay dimension, as the financial barriers further hinder access to essential SRH services for women in rural areas. Some women in the included studies reported a lack of information and difficulties accessing financial incentives for maternity care relocation, such as Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) [ Healthcare expenses paid directly by individuals in Australia comprise 17 per cent of the country’s healthcare expenditures [ Beyond the immediate health implications, it is essential to recognise the broader societal benefits associated with improving access to SRH services in rural communities. Addressing the barriers to accessing SRH services in rural areas holds wider societal benefits, including economic and social outcomes [ Considering the critical need to address barriers to SRH access in rural Australia, policymakers must prioritise targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility. First, there is a pressing need for health service redesign and interventions prioritising women’s empowerment and control over their health. Further research across different states, particularly those with significant rural populations (e.g., Western Australia), is essential to capture the diverse needs of these communities and ensure patient-centred care. This includes the prioritisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s voices in developing culturally safe antenatal care models and addressing barriers to antenatal and birthing care, especially in rural and remote Australia. Further, there needs to be a consistent use of geographic classification systems relevant to policy in rural research to facilitate decision-making from findings [ A strength of this systematic review is the use of rigorous and robust methods to identify, appraise and synthesise the literature pertaining to the barriers and facilitators to spatial and aspatial access to women’s SRH services in rural Australian healthcare settings. In particular, the comprehensive search and selection process identified a large number of included studies published in the last ten years. This review builds on existing evidence to understand health service accessibility in Australia [ Identifying the barriers and facilitators for women in accessing essential SRH services within the rural context is a necessary step for the development of comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions that address the diverse needs of rural women. Our study supports the need for targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility in rural areas. These include a comprehensive review of Medicare rebates and PBS subsidised items to enhance affordability and accessibility to SRH care, investment in digital healthcare infrastructure, and health service redesign prioritising co-design and a person-centred approach to ensure the service meets the needs of rural women. Further research is required to target the access barriers to SRH services and address the disparities in health service distribution and health inequity in rural Australia.

11466375,"Risk of Clade II Mpox Associated with Intimate and Nonintimate Close Contact Among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Adults — United States, August 2022–July 2023",,"Monkeypox virus can spread through intimate or close contact with a person with mpox. Among men who have sex with men and transgender persons who reported close contact with a person with mpox, condomless receptive anal sex was associated with approximately five times the odds of mpox after controlling for mpox vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics, and concurrent close contact behaviors. The findings in this report underscore the importance of ongoing multifaceted mpox prevention activities, including mpox vaccination and education on safer sex practices, to reduce the spread of mpox. A global outbreak of clade II mpox associated with sexual contact, disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), has been ongoing since May 2022. Information on types of contact most associated with transmission is limited. This report used data from a multijurisdictional vaccine effectiveness case-control study of sexually active persons aged 18–49 years who identified as MSM or transgender, collected during August 2022–July 2023. Odds of mpox associated with selected types of intimate and nonintimate close contact with a person with mpox were estimated. Among 457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients who met minimum data requirements, 150 (32.8%) case-patients and 57 (5.5%) control patients reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Adjusted odds of mpox were 5.4 times as high among those who reported having condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox, compared with participants who reported close contact with a person with mpox and no condomless receptive anal sex with that person (OR = 5.4; p = 0.031). Although the mpox vaccine is highly effective, vaccination coverage remains low; a multifaceted approach to prevention remains important and should include vaccination promotion, safer sex practices, and increasing awareness that mpox continues to circulate. In May 2022, an unprecedented worldwide outbreak of clade II mpox, caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), was detected among persons in countries with no history of sustained community transmission. In the United States and worldwide, the ongoing outbreak has been associated with sexual contact, and has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) ( A secondary analysis was conducted using data previously collected for a vaccine effectiveness (VE) case-control study using patient self-reported survey data and jurisdiction-reported data from 12 U.S. jurisdictions ( Case- and control patients were eligible to participate if they were sexually active, The analytic sample was restricted to case- and control patients from the VE study who reported close contact with a person with mpox. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted odds of select types of intimate and nonintimate contact and case- or control patient status. The unadjusted models examined demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender identity), a composite variable of HIV status and HIV PrEP or treatment (i.e., antiretroviral [ARV]) use and adherence, presence of immunocompromising conditions or medications, Among the 1,487 eligible survey respondents from the VE study (457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients), 207 (13.9%; 150 case-patients and 57 control patients) reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Compared with control patients, case-patients were slightly older (aged 35.5 years versus 33 years) and had fewer recent sexual partners (two versus three) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** P-values comparing the percentage of case-patients to control patients by sociodemographic and health categories were calculated using Pearson’s chi-square test. P-values for continuous variables were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. *** HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. **** Symptoms consistent with mpox included rash or skin lesions, fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. In the unadjusted models, behaviors associated with increased odds of mpox among persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox included condomless receptive anal sex (OR = 3.2; p = 0.006), condomless insertive anal sex (OR = 2.8; p = 0.009), receiving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.7; p = 0.006), giving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.0; p = 0.046), and sharing towels, bedding, or clothing (OR = 2.3; p = 0.034) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** HIV PrEP use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who did not report living with HIV. HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. Numerous studies have identified sexual contact as the primary risk factor for mpox; however, few have examined risk associated with specific intimate and nonintimate close contact behaviors. In this study, data from a previously conducted case-control study were analyzed to estimate the odds of mpox associated with selected intimate and nonintimate behaviors among MSM and transgender persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox. Condomless sex, including anal sex and oral sex, was associated with increased odds of mpox, as was sharing towels, bedding, and clothing. After adjusting for measured confounders, including mpox vaccination and concurrent close contact behaviors, condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox remained associated with increased odds of mpox. Although condoms might reduce MPXV exposure at anogenital or oral mucosal sites, condoms alone might not prevent all exposures to MPXV because rash can occur on other parts of the body and transmission can occur through other routes, including saliva and respiratory secretions ( As clade II mpox continues to circulate in the United States, mpox mitigation activities remain critical ( Studies from areas with endemic mpox and during the ongoing 2022 global outbreak have identified contaminated household items such as linens and utensils as potential, albeit less common, MPXV transmission routes ( The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, selection bias is likely because survey participation was voluntary and recruitment for control patients occurred in sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinics. Differences in sexual risk-taking behaviors might exist between those who participated in the survey and those who did not and between persons who did and did not seek health care. Second, survey data were self-reported and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias, particularly because of the sensitive nature of some of the questions regarding sexual behaviors, and because the time between index event and survey completion varied. Third, intimate contact and sexual behavior variables were limited to a few broad measures in this study and do not account for potentially important factors such as frequency and duration of contact, partner type, group sex, substance use, or impact of sexual networks, all of which might affect risk for mpox transmission. Fourth, <15% of survey participants reported close contact with a person with mpox; because of this small sample size, the analysis might be underpowered to detect associations with behaviors that were less commonly reported. Finally, although the 12 U.S. jurisdictions included in this study covered a broad geographic area, data might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. The mpox vaccine is highly effective, and clinicians should continue to promote vaccination among eligible persons.",[],2024-10-10,Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11465850,"Exploring cultural competence barriers in the primary care sexual and reproductive health centres in Catalonia, Spain: perspectives from immigrant women and healthcare providers","Immigrant populations, especially women, continue facing challenges in accessing quality healthcare, particularly sexual and reproductive health services (SRH). Poor cultural competent health systems contribute to communication challenges between immigrant women and healthcare providers perpetuating health disparities. This exploratory study describes these communication barriers from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers within the Catalan health system and its implications to ensure an equitable provision of SRH services. An exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in various municipalities of Barcelona with high concentration of immigrants. Eight focus groups ( Language barriers and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of quality healthcare provision hindered the ability of immigrant women and providers to interact effectively. Limited availability of intercultural mediators and inadequate cultural competence training opportunities for health staff were also identified. Findings suggest a lack of minority representation in the Catalan health workforce and leadership roles. This study reinforces the evidence of persistent inequities in accessing healthcare among immigrant populations by focusing on the cultural competence barriers of the Catalan health system in the provision and access to SRH services. The regularization of adequately trained intercultural mediators, quality training in cultural competence for health staff and a commitment to increase workforce diversity would contribute to improve intercultural communication between immigrant patients and providers. An urgent call to action in this direction is needed to ensure an equitable access to SRH services among immigrant women. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12939-024-02290-5.","Despite efforts made over the last two decades, evidence of disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants in accessing healthcare services persist across Europe [ Intercultural communication in healthcare is the interaction between healthcare professionals and patients of different cultural groups (international, interfaith, interethnic, interracial) to reach an understanding, build a shared reality and establish a satisfactory relationship [ The concept of cultural competence goes beyond healthcare providers’ intercultural communication skills and also involves the ability of organizations to effectively deliver healthcare services that meet the social, cultural and linguistic needs of patients [ In Spain, significant immigration flows began at the turn of the millennium when the non-native population doubled in just one decade, a growing tendency which has continued until now [ Up to date, a very few studies have addressed cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Spanish and Catalan contexts [ An exploratory-descriptive qualitative research design [ Immigrant women and healthcare providers were selected using maximum variability sampling: convenience, purposive and snowball sampling techniques were combined based on age, length of stay in Spain, educational background or healthcare role. Inclusion criteria for immigrant women were determined by their country of origin (Morocco and Pakistan), age at migration (16 years or older, thus not exposed to the public Spanish education system) and their eligibility to the cervical cancer screening program in Catalonia (aged 25 or turning 25 in the year of the study, up to 65 and having a cervix). The main inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were that they needed to be working actively in the primary care SRH centres and interacting directly with these two groups of immigrants. No exclusion criteria were established for healthcare professionals, but we ensured that providers reported at least ten consultations per week with immigrant patients from Morocco and/or Pakistan. Half of healthcare professionals reported that at least 50% of their patients were immigrants. The final sample size was determined when data saturation was achieved, indicating that additional interviews no longer provided new insights into the key dimension of the study. We recruited Moroccan and Pakistani participants in neighbourhoods of Barcelona city, Sant Adrià del Besòs, Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat. These were chosen because they represent different health districts, have a high proportion of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrants and include urban and semi-urban residential areas. We recruited a wide range of healthcare professionals, such as community health workers, nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, all of whom worked in primary care SRH centres located in the same areas where most women participants were recruited. An intercultural mediator was also included, as these professionals greatly contribute in the provision of care for immigrants. Study fieldwork was performed between July and December 2022. A total of 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) (4 [all in Darija] with 24 participants from Morocco and 4 [all in Urdu] with 27 participants from Pakistan), 22 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) (12 [7 in Darija and 5 in Spanish] with Moroccan and 10 [5 in Urdu, 1 in Punjabi and 4 in Spanish] with Pakistani women) and 13 key informant interviews (KIIs) [all in Spanish] with healthcare providers were conducted. Topic guides for FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women were designed based on a literature review on barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening among immigrant populations conducted for a broader study mentioned above. Questions covered individual (i.e. lack of language skills), interpersonal (i.e. social influences and cultural norms) and health system (i.e. interpreting and translation services) level factors. FGDs were moderated by a nurse (HOE) and a community health worker (SMH) with the same cultural and linguistic background as participants, and the first author (JGL) and two research assistants (RAs) (KM and AS), second-generation immigrant university students, conducted the SSIs. FGDs were conducted in community and religious centres (e.g. mosques) and the interviews were conducted in places chosen by the participants (e.g. women’s and interviewers’ home, religious centres). Further details of the data collection process have been reported elsewhere [ Interviews with healthcare providers explored their views and experiences providing SRH services, and specifically cervical cancer screening, to immigrant women. The overall goal was to understand how these women access healthcare, their preventive health practices, and their engagement with SRH services from the perspective of those who directly work with immigrant populations. These KIIs with healthcare providers also aimed to identify potential cultural and religious barriers and discuss strategies to increase participation in cervical cancer screening programmes, including the potential acceptance of HPV self-sampling. The first author (JGL) carried out all the interviews with healthcare professionals. These took place in the providers’ workplace, except three interviews which were conducted either at the interviewee’s home ( The RAs (KM and AS) transcribed women’s audio recordings from Darija and Urdu directly into Spanish and English, respectively, with minor editing to improve readability. The first author (JGL) and a co-author (VRS, physician and public health student) transcribed healthcare providers’ audio recordings into Spanish. We conducted a social constructionist thematic analysis [ After coding and analysing the two datasets from immigrant women and healthcare providers separately, a data triangulation process was performed following a ‘complementary’ approach: searching to describe a problem (e.g. cultural competence barriers to access SRH services) from different perspectives [ 
 Summary of cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Catalan health system using Betancourt et al.’ (2003) framework • Lack of language skills • Perceived discriminatory attitudes • Time pressure in the provision of care • Cultural taboos (e.g. offering certain SRH services) • Limited patient informed consent and confidentiality • Limited availability of intercultural mediators • Limited and underused translation services and materials • Lack of adequate cultural competence training for health staff • Low minority representation in the healthcare workforce (e.g. nurses) • Low minority representation in leadership roles The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (26186), Bellvitge University Hospital (PR 140/22) and Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (PR(AG)317/2022). Each participant was provided with comprehensive information about the study and gave written informed consent prior to data collection. Immigrant women were compensated with a public transportation 10-trip pass to ensure that participation did not impose a financial burden on them (transport to FGDs’ and SSIs’ locations) and to acknowledge their contribution to the research. Healthcare professionals did not receive any compensation. The Moroccan and Pakistani participants’ ages ranged from 24 to 65 years. The majority (82.2%) were married and nearly all Pakistani women (97.3%) had children, compared with 77.8% of Moroccan women. The primary reason for migration was family reunification. Despite most women (80.0%) of both groups having lived in Catalonia for over 5 years, up to 63% of them (52.8% Moroccan and 73% Pakistani) reported needing a translator during medical visits. A similar percentage was found among women who had arrived in the country (less than 5 years ago). Moroccan women were more likely to speak Spanish or Catalan at home than Pakistani women (33% vs. 5%). A total of 72.6% of participants reported having been screened for cervical cancer at least once in their lifetime. Women’s detailed socio-demographic information can be found in Table  Healthcare providers’ ages ranged from 29 to 59 years. All of them were female, except for a gynaecologist and a community health worker. Furthermore, eight healthcare professionals were Spanish (mainly from Catalonia) and bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) and, five were originally from either Morocco or Pakistan and one of them also bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) (Table  
 Women’s socio-demographic characteristics by country of origin ( CC: cervical cancer; IQR: interquartile range 
 Characteristics of healthcare providers interviewed Qualitative findings from the FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women, as well as from the interviews with healthcare professionals are presented below and organised by each of the cultural competence barriers identified in the framework proposed by Betancour et al. (2003) [ We identified the inability to understand and speak either of the two official languages in Catalonia (Spanish/Catalan) as a barrier among Moroccan and Pakistani women regardless of their length of stay in the country. According to healthcare providers’ perceptions, language barriers appeared more prevalent among Pakistani than Moroccan women. Women from both countries often depended on the availability of their husbands, family members and friends to arrange appointments or to receive information. For instance, when their male partners could not accompany them, some women preferred to skip or postpone medical appointments until someone else was available. Whereas Pakistani women tended to visit the doctor with their husbands, Moroccan participants counted also on friends and even on other compatriots they met while waiting in the primary care centre for appointments. Whilst the support of the husband and other family members and friends seemed to attenuate the language barriers of women, this did not guarantee that they received accurate information about SRH services. Healthcare providers reported inadequate and incomplete translations by male partners and family members: 
 Immigrant women and healthcare providers mentioned having personal strategies to overcome language barriers. Some women managed to communicate with providers using body language, through mobile phone conversations with family members or through paper notes, as this provider explained: Body language, visual materials (e.g. pictograms), physical objects (e.g. plastic uterus), translated forms and Google Translator were resources used by midwives and gynaecologists to overcome language barriers: They also emphasized the importance of expressing empathy and building rapport with immigrant patients through eye contact and using some words in their local languages to improve communication, as this female midwife explained:  While immigrant women considered the Catalan health service to be good overall, even better than in their own countries, and healthcare providers to be “caring”, some women felt they did not receive the care they expected. Several participants reported a lack of empathy and unhelpful attitudes from the health staff, especially clinic receptionists, but also some healthcare providers. Women from both Moroccan and Pakistani origin reported feelings that health staff were racist and held discriminatory attitudes against them when they could not communicate properly in Catalan or Spanish, for instance, to book a medical appointment. This deterred some women from seeking healthcare services in Catalonia and instead, seeking care in their own countries: Immigrant women also reported negative and discriminatory attitudes from healthcare providers, especially clinic receptionists, when they requested or expressed their preference for a female professional to undertake gynaecology examinations, deterring them from requesting a same sex provider in the Catalan health system: We observed that lack of culturally sensitive policies or clear guidelines to address cultural conflicts led to some confusion concerning the right of immigrant women to request a healthcare professional of the same sex. Most providers interviewed understood Moroccan and Pakistani women´s preferences for female doctors and stated that they should have the right to request it. However, two gynaecologists raised concerns that choosing the sex of the health professional would contradict the gender equity and non-discrimination policies of the Catalan health system: Even when immigrant women possessed basic or everyday language capacity, some felt they were not being listened to properly as health providers did not give them sufficient time to explain themselves: Healthcare providers confirmed this impression, explaining they have limited time allocated for each patient. Time pressure was even stronger when seeing immigrant patients with language difficulties, low literacy and lack of knowledge of the Catalan health system. This led providers to feel more overloaded and to express feelings of frustration and exhaustion: 
 
 We identified cultural differences between women and healthcare providers’ beliefs and perceptions regarding the use of certain SRH services and the context in which they would discuss them. Addressing women’s health issues, such as menstruation, in front of male relatives (e.g. husbands, sons) and offering specific SRH services, such as contraception and pregnancy termination services, could be considered offensive or against women’s cultural and religious practices, while for healthcare providers these were common issues addressed with their patients. Cultural differences were also identified regarding certain health examinations, such as cervical cancer screening, at specific times, for example, during Ramadan. A midwife also referred to the difficulties that husbands sometimes found when explaining certain women’s issues: Healthcare professionals also mentioned difficulties in addressing topics related to sexual health and genitalia. In this, they distinguished between first-generation and second-generation immigrants, perceiving the latter to be more aware of their bodies and willing to ask questions about sexual health, whereas the former were more ‘detached’ from their own bodies and had lower literacy about their own anatomy. This led some healthcare providers to provide basic information about certain tests: While immigrant women considered their husbands and other relatives as the most important social support in the host country, the health professionals sometimes found them more of an obstacle during health consultation. For instance, some professionals expressed concern about whether immigrant women made informed decisions about their SRH:  Despite this informed consent issue, a midwife emphasized the importance of establishing a good relationship with husbands due to their role as decision-makers. However, she pointed that culturally this is a challenging goal: Similarly, healthcare professionals felt that the presence of a family member reduces confidentiality and provider-patient privacy, something that is a foundation of how healthcare professionals understand quality care. For instance, the presence of relatives prevented providers from screening Moroccan and Pakistani women for highly sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or sexually transmitted infections (STIs):  Healthcare providers also reported challenges in ensuring confidentiality when they need to communicate a test result or give an appointment by phone to a woman with language difficulties, and a midwife expressed other ethical challenges they face when immigrant women go to the health centre accompanied by their underaged children to help them with translation. In these circumstances, she explained that professionals skip some explanations regarding the genitals and vaginal examination and give the patient only basic information. Gynaecologists and midwives narrated their strategies to ensure users’ privacy and confidentiality, but all of them agreed that the availability of intercultural mediators would be the most effective support to ensure confidentiality and health informed decisions: We found disparities in the provision of intercultural mediators across the Catalan health system. Whilst the primary care centres in those neighbourhoods of Barcelona city with the highest concentration of immigrants, such as Raval and Besòs, offered intercultural mediator services in various languages (e.g. Arabic, Urdu, Chinese), in other municipalities with similar volume of immigrants, such as Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, these services were very limited or even non-existent: Since mediator services were scarce, informal interpreter services were voluntarily provided by health staff of Moroccan and Pakistani origin, as this gynaecologist explained:  We also found that the intercultural mediators working currently in Barcelona are not integrated into the health system. Most of these professionals received training in intercultural mediation in the past and currently they are hired by outsourced companies and work in challenging conditions, as some providers confirmed and a mediator explained:  Despite the scarcity of intercultural mediators and lack of integration of these professionals within the health system, interviewed healthcare providers agreed that intercultural mediators play an important role in ensuring effective communication and provision of quality care to immigrant patients who lack language skills, especially in the paediatric and primary care SRH centres. They advocated for the regulation of the cost of these services in the Catalan health system and emphasized the importance of equipping these professionals with adequate intercultural mediation training to minimise potential conflicts, as healthcare providers pointed out that these professionals are not mere interpreters, but health mediators with specific training in cultural skills: One healthcare professional added that even when the mediation services are needed and available, these must be offered as an option, referring to the reluctance expressed by some immigrant women to use these services due to a lack of trust. In this sense, a midwife concluded that greater efforts must be made to explain the role of the intercultural mediators and facilitate trustee relationships between these and immigrant patients. Finally, a midwife highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the gender of the mediators, at least in the primary care SRH centres:  In addition to this insufficient number of intercultural mediators, we found an underutilisation of the available telephone translation service (061 Salut Respon) by providers. They expressed mixed opinions about this service’s effectiveness. Some considered it a good alternative if mediators were not available, but most admitted to not using this service because it was too slow for the limited time assigned per patient and suboptimal to address language and cultural problems. A few healthcare professionals were even unaware of its existence. The availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate information and education materials seemed also scarce. Healthcare professionals noted that the webpage from the Department of Health (Canal Salut), is translated into English and French in addition to the official languages in Catalonia. They explained that they usually used information and education materials (e.g. questionnaires, forms, health prevention flyers) translated into different languages, although some providers mentioned a lack of translations in Urdu, for instance. The majority of the healthcare professionals interviewed had attended cultural competence training courses at some point in their careers. They found the courses helpful but inadequate, as they were often short, general and lacked interactive activities. Some providers strongly believed that formal and compulsory training on cultural competence should be integrated into the healthcare professionals’ curriculum. Currently, cultural competence training sessions are usually provided by community-based and non-governmental organisations, and lack institutionally funding, relying on the availability of private funds. Some healthcare professionals also proposed training administrative staff, particularly receptionists, on migrants’ rights because  Healthcare providers mentioned that an ideal solution to overcome cultural competence issues would be to have a more diverse health workforce, in this case, more Moroccan and Pakistani nurses, midwives and gynaecologists:  Immigrant women also welcomed the availability of more healthcare staff from their own countries and they thought this would improve communication between immigrant patients and providers. A few Moroccan participants observed an increasing number of pharmacists, nurses, auxiliary nurses and doctors with Arabic language skills:  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing cultural competence barriers in the context of the primary care SRH centres in Catalonia, Spain, from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers. First, at clinical level, the results indicate that lack of command of the local languages (Spanish and Catalan) and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of the provision of quality care hindered the ability of immigrant women and care providers to interact effectively. Second, at structural level, we identified limited availability of intercultural mediator services and translation materials, and inadequate cultural competence trainings available for healthcare staff. Finally, at organisational level, results suggest low minority representation in the health workforce and leadership roles of the Catalan health system. Lack of knowledge of the host country’s official languages is one of the dominant barriers to obtain accurate health information, and access and use of quality healthcare services [ The contested issue about the sex of the healthcare provider, especially providing SRH services, has been extensively addressed in the literature [ Time pressure was also a relevant factor hindering communication between immigrant patients and healthcare providers. On the one hand, immigrant women reported not being given sufficient time to explain their health problems and, on the other hand, healthcare providers reported that low language skills often meant immigrant patients required longer consultation times and greater efforts to communicate with them. This, along with time constraints due to heavy patient loads, led providers to feeling frustrated and overworked, which was attributed by one gynaecologist to immigrants’ inappropriate use of healthcare services. This perception concerning immigrants’ use of the public healthcare services was also found in previous studies conducted in Catalonia with healthcare providers [ The above findings demonstrate how the intersection of language barriers and lack of sufficient resources (e.g. personnel) hinder the communication between immigrant patients and healthcare professionals. Despite these challenges, we found that both immigrant women and healthcare professionals made efforts to understand each other. Non-verbal communication, such as body language and pictograms, and the use of Google Translator were some personal strategies reported in this and previous studies conducted with migrants in Europe [ Consistent with previous research conducted with immigrant populations in Australia and the US [ Limitations to ensure confidentiality and obtained informed consent from immigrant women were other concerns raised by healthcare providers, who agreed that a fair deployment of intercultural mediators would help to address the above linguistic and cultural differences. However, we identified significant disparities in the deployment of intercultural mediators across the Barcelona province, with services predominantly available in primary care centres located in specific neighbourhoods within Barcelona city. This limited availability of mediator services aligns with findings from a recent systematic review assessing barriers and facilitators to access interpreter services in European health systems [ As in other studies performed in Pakistan and Finland [ Finally, field observation and key informant consultations suggested that the representation of minorities in the Catalan healthcare workforce is still low. Studies in the US have shown that diversity and inclusion can help organisations improve both patient care quality and financial results [ Based on our research evidence, the above cultural competence barriers at clinical, structural and organisational levels should be addressed in parallel with other health system deficiencies, such as saturation, excess of demand, insufficient time per patient [ This study has several methodological strengths and limitations. It is noteworthy to mention that the researchers’ social position (e.g. gender, age, race, immigration status) and personal characteristics and experiences affect the research process [ Regarding the study limitations, it is important to mention that the inclusion of only two national groups limits the generalizability of the findings to other immigrant experiences and cultural backgrounds, although it serves as a valuable case study. Additionally, the small sample size of healthcare professionals, who primarily work in areas with high concentration of immigrant populations, may not capture the perspectives from those working in areas where immigrants are less represented. This study emphasizes significant cultural competence barriers within the Catalan health system that hinder immigrant patient-provider relationship, potentially increasing disparities in accessing SRH services in Catalonia, Spain. Addressing these barriers requires a fair deployment of intercultural mediators, clear guidelines to help manage cultural challenges, the formalization of cultural competence training for healthcare professionals, and a commitment to increase workforce diversity. These steps are crucial to mitigating the impact of language barriers and cultural differences on communication between immigrant patients and providers, thereby improving access to quality care. Health systems across Europe, including the Catalan health system, are urged to take a proactive role and implement on-the-ground actions aiming to improve cultural competence and ensure an equitable provision of quality care for immigrant populations.

11463776,Barriers and enablers that influence the uptake of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands,"Heterosexual migrant men and women in the Netherlands often face barriers to accessing health services, including HIV testing, that may lead to late-stage HIV diagnoses. This study explored factors of influence in the usage of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants. Qualitative evaluation with semi-structured interviews at the Amsterdam-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint and one focus group discussion (FGD) conducted during June-July 2023 with 19 participants: interviews with 12 heterosexual migrants from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) and FGD (n = 5) and interviews (n = 2) with 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed, using the framework of Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. In total, 55 themes emerged from the interviews and the FGD. Examples include insufficient availability of information on HIV and testing services, and difficulty in accessing these services (e.g. the barrier of the online appointment system of the Centre for Sexual Health (CSH)). HIV test participants expressed free, rapid testing, no appointment required, and a positive experience during their HIV test as enablers to test in the future. Results from key informants showed that poor health literacy and lack of clarity on the healthcare system’s guidelines were barriers for heterosexual migrants in accessing information on HIV and testing services. It also revealed past initiatives and interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the integration of HIV testing into sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, but that were subsequently discontinued due to financial constraints. Factors contributing to a low HIV test uptake were participants’ perception of limited accessibility of CSH facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies on accessing HIV/STI testing services at CSHs, and potential missed opportunities for HIV testing at general practitioners were contributing factors identified by key informants.","While much has been accomplished in the past four decades to reduce transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections, it remains a global health concern with over 39 million people affected, of whom 2.3 million people include the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [ Certain vulnerable groups being affected by HIV, such as heterosexual migrants, require more attention to ensure the UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets are reached. Stigma and discrimination continue to play roles in the low uptake of HIV testing. Gender also plays a role, with an overall higher proportion of migrant women testing for HIV compared with migrant men [ About one-third of all migrants that arrive in the Netherlands each year are from outside the EU [ Most migrants in Europe who live with HIV are often infected postmigration, which demonstrates a need for prevention and testing in countries of arrival. Studies conducted in Europe (including the Netherlands) showed that over 50% of heterosexual migrants originating mainly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Latin America, and the Caribbean acquired HIV postmigration within the first five years [ Sexual health centers (SHCs) and general practitioners (GPs) are the main providers to test for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV in the Netherlands. STI/HIV testing at SHCs is free of charge for high-risk groups (including “those who originate from an HIV/STI endemic area”) and HIV care is reimbursed through Dutch health insurance [ At the end of 2022, there were 1390 people who remained undiagnosed for HIV in the Netherlands [ The COVID-19 government regulations that negatively impacted HIV testing rates in the Netherlands requires active (tailored) case findings of HIV along with strategic scale-up of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrant groups [ To contribute to the Declarations to end the HIV epidemic, and reduce inequities in HIV testing service delivery, this study focused on heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, and aimed to explore factors of influence in the uptake of HIV testing and identify experiences on using HIV testing services. We also aimed to understand the perception of health providers and policy advisors on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among this target population. Recommendations will be formulated to inform policy makers and health providers on strategies for improving the uptake of HIV testing. This qualitative study examined the barriers and enablers of HIV testing usage among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam served as the study site being a densely populated area of more than 250,000 migrants [ The non-governmental organization (NGO) AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint was chosen as the facility to conduct semi-structured interviews (SSI) as it provides a low-threshold, no-cost rapid HIV testing service to everyone, which assisted in finding diverse participants. The SHCs, an additional NGO, and research institution served as the main organizations for key informants, including STI nurses, policy advisors, and GPs. Furthermore, the ministry of health was also approached, but was unable to deliver someone to participate in this study. Eligible heterosexual migrants met the following criteria (based on AHF Checkpoint’s HIV test assessment form): identified as female or male, were 18 years of age or older at the time of the SSI, were a migrant from an LMIC in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, or Latin America, and identified as heterosexual. Migrants living in the Netherlands less than five years were considered to be ‘short-term’, while those living in the country five years or more were considered to be ‘long-term’. The study recruited a total of 19 participants comprised of 12 HIV test clients and 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Convenience sampling was used to recruit HIV test clients for a SSI on-site at AHF Checkpoint, during the days that the interviewer was present. This was done by communicating the study guidelines to the on-site HIV test counselors to inform and invite eligible clients after their HIV test to participate without influence or pressure. A study invitation poster in English and Spanish was posted in the lobby and HIV testing office. Two study participants, who had never tested for HIV, were recruited through word of mouth by Checkpoint clients who saw the study invitation flyer. The selection criteria for key informants were that they be either a GP, STI nurse, or policy advisor, be professionally involved with HIV testing among migrants, and have a working knowledge of the English language. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit seven key informants. Key informants were invited for the FGD via email without influence or pressure. The principal investigator (PI) conducted interviews with HIV test participants and the FGD with key informants (both face-to-face) based on the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Service Use conceptual framework, using topic guides [ Two key informants could not attend the FGD and instead suggested submitting their input via a Word document using the FGD topic questions as a guide (further referred to as ‘interviewed key informants’). One interview was performed in Spanish while the rest, including the FGD, were performed in English. All respondents provided informed consent before the interviews and FGD. Permission for the PI to audio record and take written notes of the interviews and FGD was granted by all study participants. The interviews and FGD were transcribed manually immediately after each session, and the interview performed in Spanish was first transcribed before being translated into English. Anonymity and confidentiality were ensured by not asking participants for any personal identifiers and not sharing any personal information given by key informants (i.e., name, email address, and phone number). Data collection continued until no new topics emerged. For coding, a hybrid approach was taken, with the research topic guides informing the development of a coding frame matrix, including emerging themes, based on a conceptual framework (for details: see conceptual framework). The data was coded into themes and subthemes from the interviews and FGD. The data was analyzed using this conceptual framework and the latest NVIVO software was used to classify, sort, and arrange the data in order to identify themes and patterns. The study aimed to reach a diverse group of participants and triangulate data through searching for overlapping themes between the HIV test participants and key informants, and with policy documents to ensure a thorough investigation into the research topic. A number of measures were employed to achieve quality assurance: piloting and adjusting the interview topic guide, accommodating Spanish speakers, audio recording the interviews and FGD, safe data storage techniques (including deletion of interview and FGD audio recordings after the final publication of the scientific paper), and regular follow-ups with the other two researchers, and cross-checks with the last author. The study was guided by the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model (HBM) of Health Service Use, which was adapted from the Andersen-Newman 1995 Framework of Health Service Utilization [ Psychosocial factors have an impact on decision-making about planned or intended behavior related to HIV testing, using four domains: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV [ Enabling factors may influence the frequency of usage of HIV testing services. The lack of availability of appropriate resources and support to access health services and care at the individual, contextual, community/social network, and structural levels may impede care that is necessary due to the low supply of services, or financial means [ Need is related to how people perceive their own level of health and functionality (including their risk perception of HIV infection) as well as the perception from a GP or HIV test counselor on an individual’s health and needs [ The expanded Andersen HBM model was used as a framework to analyze the results of this study (deductive approach). Themes that emerged from the interviews and FGD that did not align with this framework were added separately (inductive approach). We focused on the population characteristics and health behavior elements as these were the most relevant in relation to the usage of HIV testing services. Some results sections include information gathered from the key informants that either support or contradict the findings. An overview of Anderson model main domains and emerging themes is presented in  The KIT Research Ethics Committee (REC) approved the research protocol on 25th of May 2023. Ethical aspects involved collecting verbal informed consent from all participants (audio recorded), interview data anonymously, ensuring confidentiality of participants, and applying participant codes when analyzing and using data in the results section. Furthermore, coding and transcription reliability was checked by a second researcher to ensure the process went according to the study protocol and the REC’s recommendations. Out of 12 HIV test (HT) participants, seven resided in the Amsterdam region, and five were from other regions in the Netherlands. Most were highly educated, age range was 20–47 years, duration in the Netherlands varied from 9 months up to 45 years, and several worked in information technology. Regions of origin of the HT participants were Europe, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, and North and West Africa. Of the 12 HT participants, two had never been tested, six were first-time testers, and four had previously tested between one to four times ( The psychosocial factors involved four domains regarding HIV testing: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV. The domains originated from the expanded Andersen HBM and all emerging themes (n = 55) came from the interviews and FGD (see  Knowledge of HIV (including modes of transmission) and HIV test locations were themes that were discussed. While a few HT participants could name at least one HIV transmission mode and one body fluid that can transmit HIV, the overall knowledge of HIV was low. Eight HT participants could name at least ‘blood’ as one body fluid, while two could not name any body fluids that can transmit HIV, and also incorrect examples were given, Some indicated that they briefly learned about sexual education in primary or high school, but those from Eastern Europe and the Middle East stated that it was not taught in their country of origin. The window period of HIV testing, HIV self-test, treatment for HIV and subsequently living a normal life were emerging themes among three HT participants and some key informants. As HT participant P-1 said, 
 Two HT participants understood the need to wait the right amount of time before going for an HIV test (i.e., the window period). One mentioned that he knew to wait at least a couple of months before testing for HIV in order to get a correct result, while the other who had never tested for HIV said, 
 Online (Google) searches were discussed as the main source of information on HIV and where to find HIV test locations. In addition, four HT participants named the SHC of the public health service ( 
 The attitudes of HT participants consisted of their views on HIV testing and its importance. For half of the HT participants, their visit to AHF Checkpoint was the first time they tested for HIV in their lifetime. The majority of HT participants felt that HIV testing was an important way to prevent the spread of HIV and to not only protect one’s safety, but that of others as well. First-time and repeat testing were emerging themes. While two HT participants had never tested for HIV, they held the attitude that testing is important so that one is aware of whether or not they are transmitting the virus. As one said, 
 However, another HT participant pointed out, 
 The theme of ‘repeat testing’ emerged among those who had previously tested as being equally as important in prevention of HIV infection with one stating, Four HT participants were repeat testers (i.e., had tested more than once). One participant, who had tested for the first time in the Netherlands at AHF Checkpoint and three times in their country of origin, confirmed the importance of repeat HIV testing by stating he wanted to make it a routine. Social norms consisted of the following themes: taboo, stigma, cultural perception of HIV, and cultural expectations to care, with sexual orientation as an emerging theme. The theme of taboo was prominent among most HT participants with many stating that sex remains a taboo subject in their respective cultures. While this was not stated as a deterrent to test for HIV, one participant who had never tested for HIV said, 
 HIV test-related stigma was also mentioned by several HT participants as a result of people’s perception of HIV in their culture. As one stated, 
 One HT participant stated that while HIV is talked about, sex is only mentioned in terms of abstinence-only. And, while HIV testing is available in his country, stigma remains: 
 As migrants came from different cultural backgrounds, they had varying views on expectations to care. Most stated they were accustomed to going anywhere in their country of origin for health services. As one mentioned, 
 Key informant K-1 added to this by explaining, 
 Three HT participants mentioned paracetamol as the most common practice by GPs for treatment of general health issues. One key informant (k-5) also acknowledged this, and mentioned that this could result in trust issues with GPs. Another key informant also brought this up as a potential culture shock for migrants, stating, 
 Perceived behavioral control referred to HT participants’ reasoning behind deciding (not) to previously test for HIV and the time they took to decide to test. There were two main themes: risk perception and behavioral skills, with stable relationship and condom use as emerging themes. Fear, shame, and no sexual partner were mentioned to a lesser extent. Two participants who had never tested for HIV and one first-time tester stated that being in a stable or long-term relationship was their main reason for not testing for HIV. One of the never-before HIV testers stated, 
 Shame and not having a sexual partner were mentioned by two HT participants, respectively. Fear was also mentioned by participants and some key informants, and mainly came from HT participants not wanting to know their result at the time, with one first-time tester stating he is a hypochondriac. 
 Key informant K-6 further explained in the context of HIV treatment, 
 The majority of HT participants took less than a week to decide to test for HIV from the moment they thought that they should test. For one participant, it took nine months and for another three years before the first HIV test. Enabling factors involved three domains: the availability of HIV testing services (primarily in Amsterdam, but also other main cities in the Netherlands), including the accessibility to those services, and the openness to speak about HIV and/or testing. Three HT participants came as economic migrants, four came when they were young (age range 2–14) when their families immigrated to the Netherlands. Others came for school or job opportunities). Some HT participants mentioned the availability of HIV testing services to be overall good in the Netherlands. While one participant was only familiar with AHF Checkpoint, he also knew that AHF had testing sites in other cities. As he stated, 
 Themes such as free, without appointment, and rapid testing were seen as the more important determinants to testing at AHF Checkpoint. Other themes mentioned were discreet and convenience in terms of the proximity of AHF Checkpoint and its opening hours. As one stated, 
 Easy accessibility to HIV testing services was mentioned by several HT participants. A few encountered some difficulty in accessing HIV testing services prior to finding AHF Checkpoint. One HT participant who is a long-term migrant said, 
 One HT participant was glad to have found AHF Checkpoint, as he said, 
 The SHCs at the GGDs provide testing services to those residing in their municipality and who meet certain requirements such as age and sexual preference, as stated by key informants. HT participants mentioned AHF Checkpoints having no such restrictions and people from other postal code areas are also allowed to test for HIV. Regarding the age requirement, one HT participant said, Regarding the postal code requirement, another participant stated, “ While none of the participants stated language being a barrier when trying to access HIV testing services at the SHC or GP, key informant K-3 discussed how the SHC provided an online system to make appointments, but encountered some challenges: 
 This domain referred to whether or not HT participants were able to bring up the subject of HIV and/or testing. There were three themes: family, friends, and colleagues. While a couple of HT participants felt it would be fine to approach their family about the topic of HIV (testing) and that they would feel supported, most felt that it would not be a good idea. As one participant discussed, 
 Despite several HT participants coming from conservative cultural backgrounds, the majority felt that they could speak openly with their friends. However, one participant who had never tested for HIV pointed out with regards to family and friends, 
 All HT participants said they would not discuss HIV and/or testing with their colleagues due to either feeling uncomfortable or unnecessary to do so. However, one mentioned, 
 The need factors consisted of two domains: perceived need (HT participant) and evaluated need (Key informants). Perceived need had the theme of an HT participant’s perception of HIV risk, while evaluated need had the theme of key informants’ (GPs’) beliefs on heterosexual migrants’ risk for HIV. An HT participant’s perceived risk for HIV influenced their decision to test, with unprotected sex (mostly from a one-night stand or a new partner) and physical symptoms being an emerging theme. One HT participant mentioned injecting drug use: 
 Since most HT participants had either tested for the first time in their lifetime at AHF Checkpoint or had never been tested for HIV, most had not been to a GP for an HIV test. Two HT participants, both long-term migrants, had been to a GP before to test for HIV. However, one of them who had a first HIV test at AHF Checkpoint discussed how their GP turned them away due to their low risk: 
 To further illustrate this point, key informant K-7 pointed out, 
 The usage of HIV testing services consisted of three main themes: expectations of the HIV test service, experience during the HIV test, and competency of the health providers (i.e., HIV test counselor(s)). Having a knowledgeable HIV test counselor, safe space, anonymity, no judgement, reliability of test, friendly staff, and relaxing setting were mentioned among the HT participants as expectations they had from AHF Checkpoint, with one explaining, 
 Another added, 
 None of the HT participants who had previously tested ever had a negative experience during an HIV test. Participants were asked what they would do or what their reaction would be if they were to ever have an HIV testing experience that was negative or uncomfortable. Some stated that in that case, they would still return to test for HIV for health reasons (i.e., wanting to know the result) and because it’s free. Some mentioned they would either ask for someone else at the Checkpoint to test them or go elsewhere. One HT participant was direct and said, 
 The 10 HT participants who were recruited after their HIV test at AHF Checkpoint expressed that they had a positive experience during their HIV test (two others were never-before testers). Those who experienced some anxiety or panic prior to taking the test mentioned that the HIV test counselor made them feel relaxed and at ease. However, one participant compared his experience to that of their country of origin when entering the Kilo Store (i.e., entrance of the AHF Checkpoint): 
 All HT participants stated that the HIV test counselor on duty had a strong level of competency: They named important attributes that the HIV test counselor(s) possessed: knowledgeable of HIV, reassurance, ability to handle anxiety, and ability to explain the HIV test procedure well. One of the two participants who had never tested for HIV said she would expect the person performing the test to be nonjudgmental, and the other never-before HIV tester mentioned, 
 This factor consisted of two themes: the Dutch healthcare system in relation to HIV testing (as well as general health services) and discrimination. Health literacy was an emerging theme. The majority of HT participants claimed to not know very much about the Dutch healthcare system. Three participants stated knowing that one must first register with a GP before obtaining any type of health service (including HIV testing), and that the SHC (GGD) also offers HIV testing. One HT participant expressed, however, that he already expected the SHC to not be a useful resource for him and his partner for HIV testing: 
 Another HT participant knew of a private clinic in Utrecht, but the cost was a barrier as he said, 
 One key informant mentioned that the health system in the Netherlands is decentralized, with GGD facilities serving as additional resources to the regular healthcare system. Regarding the responsibility to offer HIV testing and prevention services, she added, 
 Moreover, this key informant added to the complexity of the healthcare system in terms of STI/HIV testing: 
 Also, various key informants stated poor health literacy among migrants being the biggest problem because it impedes their ability to know how and where to go for health services. As one key informant stated, 
 All HT participants stated they did not experience discrimination during their HIV test consultation at AHF Checkpoint or when acquiring general health services in the Netherlands. External environment and its influence on the use of HIV testing services referred to two themes: place of residence, and health policies and guidelines. Most HT participants resided in the Amsterdam region, but five resided in different regions, of whom three in cities more than 30 kilometers from Amsterdam. Despite those who reside far away still coming to test for HIV at AHF Checkpoint, one key informant stated geographical availability as a barrier to HIV testing. Regarding HIV prevention awareness geared towards migrant groups, one key informant stated, 
 The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM in Dutch) guideline regarding which groups to include for STI/HIV testing at SHCs, on which financial payment is based, includes people from an endemic HIV country for HIV testing. In reality, however, it is not guaranteed that these individuals could test for HIV at their local SHC, as SHCs have some liberty to make their own priorities due to financial constraints. As key informant K-1 explains, 
 One key informant added that a full STI screening may not always be offered even if the SHC is not at full capacity. Individuals wanting further testing will be referred to their GP. HIV testing guidelines for GPs include an indicator-condition approach as well as offering routine testing to at-risk groups. However, missed HIV testing opportunities at GPs still exist, according to key informant K-3. One key informant explained how her team addressed to the ministry the importance of integrating sexual health at the national level so that cities will integrate it into their local policy. She further discussed that the general attitude of municipalities does not make it easy to find additional financing. Key informant K-3 added, 
 One key informant said the SHCs ask for one’s postal code before making an appointment, which she considered a barrier. Another key informant added, 
 When K-4 was asked whether or not people knew of this fact, she replied, 
 The perceived health status factor referred to HT participant’s perception of their overall health and the influence it has on seeking health services, including HIV testing. If participants had a perceived overall good health status, they were less likely to go to the doctor for any health service. In some cases, sexual behavior was the main reason to visit the doctor. As participant P-9 stated, 
 One of the participants who had never tested for HIV said that if she experienced symptoms of any kind, she would go to the doctor, but would not think it was HIV: 
 The evaluated health status referred to HT participants’ health being assessed by a health professional (i.e., GP or nurse), in relation to going for an HIV test. Only one participant who had tested for HIV with a GP in the Netherlands discussed, 
 Three key informants mentioned there being a lack of HIV testing even with the introduction of indicator-condition guided HIV testing due to its broad nature and GPs being uncertain of when to offer the test. Another key informant (K-5) said, 
 Key informant K-2 mentioned the efforts in trying to remedy this, 
 HT participants and key informants were asked about their suggestions on how to improve HIV testing in the Netherlands among heterosexual migrants. Some HT participants brought up the importance of awareness campaigns, outreach activities, and promotion and normalization of HIV testing (services). All key informants highlighted the need to improve the health literacy of heterosexual migrant groups, particularly men since they tend to enter into HIV care at a later stage due to the difficulty of finding their way into the healthcare system. Many HT participants felt the need to have more free testing services to remove financial barriers. One participant suggested having more HIV testing services available on Saturdays. Also, several HT participants mentioned not having enough available information regarding where to test for HIV. As one pointed out, 
 A key informant corroborated this by saying, 
 A couple of key informants mentioned past interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the HIV Transmission Elimination Amsterdam (H-TEAM), and the integration of HIV testing into other health services (e.g., prenatal screening and HIV/STI testing). However, a few key informants mentioned that the integration of HIV testing into STI testing encountered financing issues. See  This study identified factors that contributed to a low uptake of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, namely HT participants’ low knowledge of HIV (including where to test), perception of limited accessibility of SHC facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies and guidelines on accessing HIV/STI testing services at SHCs and missed opportunities for HIV testing at GPs were contributing factors identified by key informants. Low overall knowledge of HIV (including transmission routes and where to test) was present among some HT participants, despite interviews having been conducted after the participants’ HIV test counseling session (with the exception of two persons who had never tested). Despite this, the majority of HT participants believed that HIV testing was of high importance. Furthermore, long-term migrants were not very familiar with the Dutch healthcare system, even less in relation to HIV testing services, despite four being raised or living in the Netherlands since their youth. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors influenced the use of HIV testing services (including repeat testing). The main reasons HT participants tested at AHF Checkpoint were because they provide free, rapid testing, with no appointment required. The cost of HIV testing was seen as a barrier or enabler depending on the context. The free HIV testing service of AHF Checkpoint was an enabling factor that many participants stated when searching for an HIV test. Conversely, some HT participants and key informants mentioned costs at private clinics and GPs being a deterrent to testing for HIV. While an online HIV self-test was mentioned by an HT participant as an alternative to the high costs at private clinics, it was felt that the cost would still be a deterrent for most migrants. The postal code requirement and the SHC’s online appointment system were perceived as barriers by both HT participants and key informants. Key informants explained the challenges that migrants face regarding accessibility to and availability of test services. Interestingly, the participants who had never tested for HIV perceived the accessibility to HIV testing services to be overall good, but also felt that most migrants they know are completely unaware of where to test and of the requirements. Any information on HIV and testing services was mainly accessed on the internet with unavailability of information in multiple languages. Moreover, HT participants came from different countries with varying cultures, and thus had different expectations of care. However, this was more reflected in acquisition of general health services. The issues of accessibility remain a challenge in the Netherlands despite its major cities committed to translating HIV and testing information into multiple languages, and improving the access to this information that goes beyond the conventional methods used by public health institutions, as outlined by the Sevilla Declaration [ HT participants perceived their risk of HIV to be low, which led some to feel that an HIV test was previously unnecessary and others to feel that future HIV testing is needed in cases of unprotected sex. HIV testing was also considered more important for the gay community. However, as mentioned by a key informant, heterosexual men may not consider themselves gay or bisexual despite sexual interactions with other men. Also, some participants perceived condom use and being in a stable relationship as reasons to not test for HIV. As studies in the Netherlands have shown, low risk perception of HIV was more likely among heterosexual migrant men and women, and health providers do not always think about testing for HIV in the presence of HIV indicator conditions when patients are of older age [ Literature on never-before HIV tested heterosexual non-Western migrants in Europe showed the main barriers to testing as being the belief of migrants not being HIV infected and the lack of knowledge of HIV, including where to test (for no or low cost) [ Inter(national) studies have shown that fear of the test result plays a big role in not seeking testing due to perceived consequences of a diagnosis, which include social stigma from communities discovering their result [ While no participants in our study experienced discrimination or stigmatization when trying to access health services (including HIV testing) in the Netherlands, other recent Dutch studies showed the contrary [ A successful initiative to reduce HIV transmission has been the Amsterdam H-TEAM, which uses biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions to reach MSM and people who originate from countries with a high HIV prevalence [ The theoretic (expanded) framework used in this study guided the analysis on the issues raised. The hybrid analysis-approach (deductive and inductive) helped to create and find themes that were not explicitly laid out in the framework. The adaptability of the framework makes it useful in future health service utilization studies, but including the ‘predisposing characteristics’ from the earlier framework alongside the psychosocial factors instead of replacing it is recommended since it would capture more of the e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic and family size issues related to the usage of HIV testing services. In this study, the factors ‘Consumer Satisfaction’ and ‘Personal Health Practices’ were excluded since the former was already reflected in the section on ‘Experience during HIV Test.’ The latter factor was excluded since there was no difference seen between individuals with a healthy or not so healthy lifestyle linked to (ever) testing for HIV. Furthermore, the successful inclusion of heterosexual male participants in this study was also a strength that provided new insight into the (assumed) lesser willingness of heterosexual migrant men to test for HIV. Despite the HIV test counselors on duty being female (with the exception of a male test counselor on one day of data collection), a larger willingness to participate was among males. Data collection from both HT participants and key informants allowed for confirmation of results (data triangulation). We included two people who had never before been tested for HIV and six first-time testers. Different perspectives were obtained through the recruitment of participants from countries with various cultures and religions. Additionally, a variety of key informants from different work backgrounds provided a well-rounded discussion on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among heterosexual migrants. Two key informants, however, were unable to participate in the FGD and provided responses on our questions on paper. Consequently, these key informants were not able to share and exchange experiences with other key informants, which is a limitation. Having a diverse group of HT participants may have also had some limitations, e.g., not always having males and females within each migrant group. Furthermore, convenience sampling in one location in Amsterdam may have affected representativeness of the study, especially since participants from rural areas were not included, potential issues (e.g., distance to SHCs) that were found in Dutch studies did not play a role in our study [ While language was not presented by HT participants as a major barrier, it does not mean that this barrier does not exist. The selection criteria tool was only available in English and Spanish. As a result, there was potential selection bias with migrants either speaking English or Spanish. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of migrant populations, they cannot be seen as one cultural group, which limited the study in focusing on specific migrant sub-groups. Similarly, factors like poverty, employment, and lack of education remain issues in accessing HIV information and testing services, but our participants were relatively well-educated. Moreover, our study was unable to delve into the political aspect of health system financing (except for some statements about a broader involvement of the municipality in providing additional finance for testing) and its influences on the use of health facilities and health providers in providing HIV information and testing services. This study found several factors that pose a barrier to HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors are key in understanding why and how migrants use HIV testing services, but the inclusion of other components (of the framework) is also crucial in helping to assess inequalities in accessing these services. AHF Checkpoint was considered by HT participants to be a convenient and easily accessible HIV testing facility. Recognizing the importance of all components can guide policy makers in using evidence-informed interventions to improve the access to and availability of HIV information and testing services in the Netherlands. The input received from HT participants and key informants helped create recommendations (Tables  (DOCX) (DOCX)",[],2024-10-9,PLOS ONE,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11462721,Female transactional sex workers’ experiences and health-seeking behaviour in low-middle income countries: a scoping review,"For a variety of reasons related to biology, behaviour, and environment, a subset of a population known as female sex workers (FSWs) or female transactional sex workers is at increased risk of health, depression, social stigma and access to timely and quality healthcare when needed. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there was lack of understanding regarding the experiences and healthcare utilisation and behaviours, the health burden among them, their experiences, and how they access health care. Using Anderson’s behavioural model of health service utilisation as a framework, this review aimed to explore the experiences of, and healthcare seeking behaviours of female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries. Six relevant databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1990 and December 2023 that discussed female transactional sex work in low- and middle-income countries. Subject terms such as: low-and middle- incomes, sex workers (female and male), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the sex work industry, prostitution, commercial sex, and health-seeking behaviour were used for the databases search. Out of 6,135 articles that were retrieved for the study, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Of the total number of studies, four were reviews, eight were quantitative studies, six were qualitative studies, and two utilised mixed methods. Results from a thematic analysis of studies that combined quantitative and qualitative methods yielded six overarching themes.The study found that women engaged in sex work for different reasons – to fend for themselves (i.e., livelihood), self-employment and others do it for pleasure. However, force sex or unprotected which can lead to sexually transmitted infections, sexual abuse, job insecurity, were critical risks factors in engaging in sex work. These factors make them vulnerable to predators and health risks. It was found that sex workers were aware of the importance of seeking healthcare, and do make the efforts, however, crucial factors such as difficulty accessing healthcare and maltreatment by healthcare providers and social stigma disincentivises FSW health-seeking behaviours. Sexual workers reported discomfort disclosing their occupations because of the stigma and discrimination which further affects their regular health examinations and obtaining medically approved condoms from healthcare facilities. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare afflict female sex workers in LMICs. The maltreatment and stigma can potentially affect LMICs from achieving using health facility care, with potential implications on achieving the universal health coverage goals. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs."," Female transactional sexual behaviour is associated with public health problems worldwide and presents many conceptual challenges for researchers [ The health and well-being of female sex workers (FSWs) are greatly impacted by a number of issues and vulnerabilities that are specific to the profession in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, FSW in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should not be overlooked as a minor aspect of the social and economic crisis. Governments are becoming more aware of the problems and dangers faced by sex workers and their health-seeking activities [ In addition, the environment in which FSWs conduct their business often vary and with different experiences, thereof. According to a qualitative study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, FSWs meet clients online as well as in real-world settings like venues and outdoor areas. Due to the criminalisation of their profession, the women involved reported experiencing severe stigma, assault from customers and authorities, and difficulties getting access to healthcare. Those who used online venues faced extra dangers, including extortion and cybersecurity threats [ In urban versus rural settings, FSWs may have very different experiences. Though there is more competition and violence in urban areas; therefore, FSWs may have better access to clients and services [ However, the universal health coverage (UHC) principles are widely championed because a population’s healthcare-seeking behaviour (HSB) has a major impact on a country’s health status and, as a result, socioeconomic growth [ It includes factors such as the type of provider, adherence to treatment, reasons for choosing a professional, and reasons for not seeking help. The environment’s characteristics significantly influence individuals’ decisions to seek healthcare, with specific characteristics determining their HSBs [ The literature has shown that many FSWs face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, preferring informal providers due to fear of stigma and discrimination. Studies show that up to 70% of FSWs avoid public health facilities due to discrimination, stigma and mistreatment concerns [ This review draws on Anderson’s model of health-seeking behaviour Fig.  Health service utilization model. Source: Adapted from Saah; Andersen and Davidson [ Thus, this study aim to explore their sex work experiences and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of female sex work in LMICs, addressing the unique challenges faced by sex workers. It highlights the complexities of healthcare utilization and the social, economic, and security threats to their livelihoods, thereby enabling the development of public health efforts and interventions [ To find relevant research, this review conducted a comprehensive mapping of studies that focused on commercial or transactional sex work and the health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) of female sex workers. The following steps proposed by Arksey and O’Malley’s [ These searches were conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, the author conducted a thorough search for non-traditional sources of information, as well as examined the reference lists of all relevant studies that were found, in order to uncover any more research papers that align with our search criteria [ A systematic search was conducted on published literature within these popular databases in the field health, psychology and social sciences. The following keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were combined in the searches: “transactional sex work” OR “commercial sex work” “prostitute” OR “prostitution” OR “sex work” OR “sex worker” OR “female sex workers” OR “STIs” OR “health-seeking behavior” AND “low-middle income countries”. The study included studies published between 1990 and 2023. This was the period within which discussions on HIV/AIDS and STIs’ among female sex workers became prominent in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa [ Relevant components of the study aims, methods used and the findings were extracted and summarised. Out of 6,347 articles found using the database and manual search, 1,215 made it through the title and abstract screening process after duplicates were removed. After the screening, 202 studies were considered eligible for assessment, and 22 studies were ultimately selected after triangulation by three (3) separate reviewers. The final tally for the papers included in the analysis was 26 after screening and adding 3 prior review studies (Fig.

 Summary of mapped studies included in the systematic scoping review 
 Summary of Factors 
 Summary of Factors Affecting Health Seeking Behaviour (HSB) of prostitutes Demographics and socioeconomic variables commonly identified and discussed in these studies included age, marital status, level of education, family background, ethnicity, religious backgrounds and poverty. In 80.8% ( In 19 (73.1%) studies participants identified factors that led them to female transactional sex work. FSWs indicated that the primary factor influencing their decisions to work in the area of commercial sex was that, they were from poor financial background, had no job, did not have any identifiable sources of income and found it difficult to fend for themselves [ Respondents in other studies involving FSWs in Nigeria and others in public Universities in Ghana, provided a list of reasons for entering into the sex work industry that extended beyond money or material benefits. A subset of participants in the study provided the following explanations:  From the analysis, female sex workers (FSWs) revealed that the majority of male clients exhibit resistance in regards to condom usage prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. The vulnerability of younger sex workers was heightened by their inexperience and lack of proficiency in bargaining, leading to difficulties in advocating for condom use during sexual encounters. FSWs also mentioned issues of vulnerability to extortion by state security personnel such as Police Officers, who sometimes would abuse sex workers physically, and demand unprotected sex. Most cultures in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) frown upon transactional sex work. Thus, sex workers commonly reported discomfort discussing their profession, accessing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing, and when they need approved and affordable condoms from the local health clinics [ Several studies have revealed dangers associated with violence or sexual assault perpetrated by clients. The circumstances that are thought to increase the vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to violence include visiting a client’s residence, engaging in nocturnal sessions, and meeting unfamiliar individuals at unknown locations [ The iteration of the results show that FSWs visit drinking bars and night clubs in and around urban areas at night in search of customers, whilst others operate in rented rooms (i.e. hotels, guest houses, and brothels). There were other categories such as those who provide escort services to clients. These categories are highly paid female sex work and involve sexual encounters by appointment with an exclusive client. Such FSWs leave their mobile phone contacts and pictures in hotels and guest houses in, and around their respective areas of operations, to be contacted by prospective customers in Mainland China, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria and similar LMICs [ Studies maintain that once they are selling sex, they are also trying to avoid abuse from clients and law enforcement agencies, such Police Officers. It was found that FSWs sought love and to build a future. Therefore, FSW indulge in romantic relationships with young men without prior medical screening for health status including sexually transmitted infections [ Analysis of factors influencing health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) was based on Andersen’s behavioural model of healthcare utilisation [ Andersen indicates that although predisposing and enabling factors are necessary for health service utilisation, they are not sufficient explanations for “actual use” of healthcare. “Actual use” is initiated by need, which might arise as a result of level of the health condition [ In this study, enabling factors at the female sex worker (FSW) level included wealth and income at the her disposal to cover the cost of assuming positive health-related lifestyles such as good nutrition, physical exercising, wearing of condom, engaging in other safe sex practices and good personal hygiene [ At the individual FSWs level, the model differentiates between perceived need for health services, which refers to how individuals perceive and experience their own health status (such as self-rated health, functional state, and illness symptoms), evaluated need, which involves objective measurements of FSWs’ health status, health screening, and need for health care [ The enhanced healthcare seeking behaviour among FSWs can be attributed to their apprehension of developing the intricate type of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their increased awareness about health, as shown in studies in Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and other LMICs [ Two articles reported that women engaged in street-based sex work, whether separated or married, were more likely to seek health services from clinics or hospitals, when compared to those who were not or never married [ The study aimed to synthesize existing findings on female sex workers experiences, survival strategies, and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. The findings revealed that female sex workers had a high level of formal education, were primarily between the ages of 12 and 35, were either gainfully employed in other sectors or unemployed, and had financial needs. Female sex workers (FSWs) who were married or separated showed an increased likelihood of seeking healthcare. However, FSWs faced challenges in seeking healthcare due to derogatory and discriminatory behaviours towards them, high healthcare fees, and discrimination and maltreatment from providers. Generally, the majority of women involved in transactional sex work experience various degrees of vulnerability. Thus, FSWs’ increased awareness of health concerns and their desire to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) motivated them to seek healthcare. Some FSWs engaged in the act to earn a living, while others primarily engaged in sex work for the fun of it. The majority of the studies examined indicate that most women engaged in sex work at the age of 12 or older had received some level of formal education. These women faced a lack of opportunities to earn income, and many considered dropping out of school as a pivotal moment in their lives, which aligns with existing literature [ First, male clients’ non-adherence and prioritisation of heath protection. Crucial concerns of their health was high, due to clients’ refusal, and deliberate uncooperative attitude towards condom usage during sexual service provision, and incidents of violence. It is worth noting that clients’ refusal to cherish and use sexual protection was closely linked to ‘power and control imbalances’ in the transactional sex work business, as well as the ‘terms’ of ‘contract’ between commercial sex workers and their male clients. From the results, the male clientele tends to exert more dominance in the entire negotiation process. In this context, the use of condoms during transactional sexual interactions is an essential aspect. A quick scan of the literature demonstrates that unprotected sex exposes the lives of FSWs and their clients, to STIs including HIV. Indeed, there was high HIV prevalence in the sex work industry. For example, in 2012, the World Bank report on the health of sex workers showed that across all regions, HIV prevalence was 11.8%, and 36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa, with Malawi (70.7%), South Africa (59.6%), Kenya (45.1%), Rwanda (24.0%) [ Second, health and bodily security were crucial findings from literature. The findings have shown that FSWs were susceptible to multiple problems of health risks, violence and physical harm. Indeed, concerns relative to sexual violence, rape, condom failure, and instances of police officers’ misconduct, were mentioned. These led to concerns of anxiety about contracting HIV through rape and unprotected sex [ Female sex workers faced multiple human rights violations. The results have shown that issues of discrimination and class concerns existed and how women’s bodies were turned into commodities for distinct ulterior motives. Indeed, increased criminalization and social stigmatisation, potentially leading to further discrimination from health providers, hindered their access and utilisation of health facility care [ Finally, the study found that FSWs felt compelled to use healthcare, aligning with Andersen’s healthcare usage model. In nearly all of the included articles, FSWs showed increased health awareness and self-reported health screening in locations such as Mainland China [ Key strength of the study stems from its geographical coverage and the wide duration which allowed saturation of data on the themes. The study also included articles from The study was guided by Anderson’s healthcare utilisation model; meanwhile different frameworks were used to analyse female sex workers experiences and health seeking behaviours in the included studies. The subject investigated has cultural and health implications, and thus, the non-inclusion of cultural nuances in the search may have left out relevant articles. However, given the saturation of the findings in the themes, it is believed, additional articles may only support what has been found. Despite the novel findings presented in this study, they must be read against the backdrop of the following limitations. The review investigates the experiences of female sex workers, and their health-seeking behaviours in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it does not (and cannot) address all of the concerns with geographical distinctiveness in low- and middle-income countries in one study. Further, some articles were not available in full text or freely accessible via search engines for inclusion in the data set. However, the anticipated effect of non-access to the full texts, which are less likely to be published in low impact factor journals, may be to add only a number of supporting articles to the already established themes. Finally, female sex work has shifted from traditional brothel-based sex work to internet-based sex work and a mix of different types, over the last years. The vulnerabilities faced by women in sex work depend on the type of sex work they are engaged in, whether it’s brothel-based, street-based, massage parlour-based, internet-based, or other forms of transactional sex. However, this study could not explore these nuances, which has limited the conclusions relative to the vulnerabilities across the broad spectrum of female sex work. This study recommends further studies in these areas for policy, social intervention and health programming. The review’s findings validate several notions outlined in Anderson’s health seeking model, specifically that socio-demographic factors like education, occupation (particularly sex work), and the effectiveness of medications or pharmaceuticals are inadequate for determining the utilisation of conventional healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, the utilisation of orthodox health facilities by FSWs was not significantly influenced by age or marital status. The study also discovered a noteworthy relationship between the vocation of sex work and the practice of self-medication. Variables such as age, education, marital status, work status, and work experience did not show a significant correlation with self-medication from the literature. The findings have shown that female sex work in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents complex policy challenges with significant implications for public health, human rights, and social welfare. Overall, policies regarding female sex work in LMICs should prioritize the rights, health, and well-being of sex workers while addressing the broader social, economic, and structural factors that shape their experiences. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare services was found to negatively impact female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was found that female sex work was motivated by the need to earn living although others engaged in the business for the love it. Nevertheless, FSWs were exposed to multiple risks of sexually transmitted infections, threats of sexual and physical violence against them, as well as human rights violations from clients and law enforcement agencies. Indeed, access to health facility for healthcare become problematic due to discrimination and stigma by healthcare providers. The maltreatment and stigma meted to FSWs, potentially inhibits their health outcomes, the countries attainment of universal health coverage goals, and without access to care for FSWs, HIV could become an endemic health problem. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs. Furthermore, to address the factors relative to healthcare seeking behaviours of FSWs, there is an urgent wake-up call to ensure comprehensive, non-discriminatory, and accessible healthcare is available to improve their healthcare utilisation.","['Commercial sex work', 'Prostitution', 'Transactional sex', 'Low-middle income countries']",2024-10-9,BMC Public Health,"""sexually transmitted infection"""

11461325,Malate dehydrogenase in parasitic protozoans: roles in metabolism and potential therapeutic applications,"The role of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in the metabolism of various medically significant protozoan parasites is reviewed. MDH is an NADH-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes interconversion between oxaloacetate and malate, provides metabolic intermediates for both catabolic and anabolic pathways, and can contribute to NAD+/NADH balance in multiple cellular compartments. MDH is present in nearly all organisms; isoforms of MDH from apicomplexans (","Protozoan parasites are responsible for a variety of diseases, particularly in the developing world where infection of humans and livestock contributes to cycles of poverty [ The parasitic species discussed here often have complex life cycles needed for survival and pathogenesis; different life stages can have distinct patterns of metabolic flux and nutrient utilization. Common themes include emphasis on glycolysis and substrate-level phosphorylation, absence of common pathways like TCA cycle (or use of these enzymes in non-traditional ways), and adapted or reduced mitochondria-like organelles [ To summarize current understanding about roles of MDH in some representative parasitic species, we provide an overview of what is known about the respective MDH isoforms and metabolic pathways that influence flux of intermediates to or from MDH. Although little is yet known about specific contributions of MDH to pathogenicity in parasitic protozoans, our aim is to direct those interested in this field to the relevant literature. Although there is not space in this review for detailed analysis of each MDH isoform, the VEuPathDB (veupathdb.org; [ The phylum  This schematic highlights key pathways in cytoplasm and some organelles: mitochondria ( For current genomic and proteomic information on parasitic MDHs, refer to  Abbreviations for Pathways: NadR = NAD+ regeneration (for glycolysis), MAS = Mal/Asp shuttle, FA = Fatty acid synthesis, AA = amino acid catabolism, PHR = NADPH regeneration, Gluc = gluconeogenesis.

A common theme in parasitic energy metabolism is the use of glycolysis and other pathways for substrate-level phosphorylation rather than TCA Cycle, with MDH contributing to NAD+/NADH balance and supplying metabolites for substrate-level phosphorylation. Apicomplexan parasites have cytoplasmic MDH but often lack mitochondrial MDH and use a different oxidoreductase (MQO) to convert malate to oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle. Amitochondriate parasites utilize anaerobic fermentation and distinctive metabolic compartmentalization. Apicomplexan and amitochondriate parasites have LDH genes that have only recently evolved by gene duplication from MDH, and these enzymes may have overlapping functions in maintaining redox equivalents. Trypanosomatids have three isoforms of MDH: cytoplasmic and mitochondrial and glycosomal but lack LDH. They do not have a canonical TCA cycle in mitochondria. The glycosomal MDH maintains NAD+ for glycolysis. The unusual metabolic and structural features of parasitic MDHs make them potentially useful as drug targets, and similarities with LDH suggest that non-competitive dual MDH-LDH inhibitors might have greater efficacy than inhibiting either enzyme alone.","['Apicomplexan', 'Kinetoplastid', 'MDH', 'parasitic protozoa']",2024-10-03,Essays in Biochemistry,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11460792,Extraction Free RT-PCR Surveillance Testing and Reporting for SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated sensitive, fast and inexpensive testing for the virus on university campuses across the nation in 2020 prior to the widespread availability of vaccines. Early testing efforts were limited by bottlenecks on reagents, low throughput testing options and slow return of test results. In this paper we detail the testing pipeline we established at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for rapid, inexpensive and sensitive surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the strengths of the platform that would allow it to be applied to other disease surveillance projects, SARS-CoV-2 variant testing or future pandemics.","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 leading to the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered research laboratories across the country and necessitated innovation in viral testing that was sensitive, fast and inexpensive for clinical diagnostic and non-clinical surveillance applications. Further, testing needs and capabilities varied dramatically based on local resources. As a biotechnology core on a major public campus with over 45,000 students and staff our group was uniquely positioned to attempt to address local testing needs. Initial diagnostic testing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in early 2020 relied on the detection of two viral nucleocapsid targets (2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2) alongside a human positive control (RP) utilizing specific RNA extraction kits and a small number of RT-PCR Mastermix options[ Numerous other groups have developed innovative extraction free testing platforms for SARS-CoV-2 detection and have repeatedly shown the process to be similarly sensitive to extraction based protocols[ Here we detail the optimization of non-clinical extraction free RT-PCR testing for surveillance. Given the excellent clinical diagnostic testing options that became available in our area as well as early, widespread vaccination efforts our surveillance system was not fully utilized. The infrastructure in place would allow us to respond rapidly to an increased need for testing and can be adapted for other qPCR-based surveillance purposes such as respiratory illness screening, sexually transmitted infection screening, or response to a future potential pandemic agent. Unsupervised self-collection was performed using the Response Sample Kit (Genturi, Verona, WI). Instructions were printed and distributed in kit as shown ( RT-PCR Mastermix is prepared using 3 uL 4x Taqpath 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix with Mustang Purple (Applied Biosystems), 1 uL N1-FAM Primer-Probe, 1 uL N2-ABY Primer-Probe, 1 uL RP-VIC Primer-Probe, and 3.5 uL Nuclease Free Water. 9.5 uL of this Mastermix is added to 3 uL Sample for a total reaction volume of 12.5 uL in one well of a 384-well plate. Primer-Probe sequences and concentrations can be found in  Data was exported into the Design and Analysis Software Version 2.5 for the QuantStudio 6/7 Pro systems (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Amplification curve phenotypes were assessed and ΔRn thresholds were set at 1 for N1 and N2 and at 0.3 for RP. Cq values were exported and analyzed along with “Referral” and “No Action Needed” assessments as shown in  We developed our own qRT-PCR assay based on CDC recommended viral targets and controls[ Given the shortage of clinical testing materials (especially RNA extraction kits and VTM) and our desire to create a rapid, inexpensive surveillance test we developed a testing platform utilizing nasal swabs in a PBS medium. Initial testing with BEI inactivated virus showed similar sensitivity of the assay using water, PBS and saliva as a medium ( An overview of the testing process is pictured in  First, participants are instructed to scan the QR code on the bag with their smartphone which opens a website designed by the UW-Madison Division of Information Technology (DoIT) ( The upload location is monitored by an automated process watching for new .csv files. When a new file is found it is parsed and the test results are merged with the matching user. Known controls (guaranteed “referral” or “non-referral”) in the results are validated and administrators are alerted when a result didn’t match expected outcomes ( The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic challenged the scientific community to respond and innovate to meet the need for viral testing. Clinical diagnostic testing in labs with CAP/CLIA approval was the early gold standard in testing but its reliance on RNA extraction reagents, approved nasal swabs and transport medium and the need for well-trained personnel to staff the testing labs meant that availability of these tests early on was scarce. We sought to develop a non-clinical surveillance testing pipeline that bypassed these restrictions for rapid, inexpensive and sensitive testing results to inform local decision-making. Our results show that our extraction free multiplex RT-PCR testing platform retains sensitivity while bypassing RNA extraction, providing a testing option that is faster, cheaper and more scalable than traditional extraction-based clinical diagnostic testing. Our group was specifically tasked with delivering a testing process that can be completed in 6–8 hours for rapid turnaround of surveillance test results to inform decision making on our campus. We accomplished this by partnering with campus healthcare workers (University Health Services) and campus information technology specialists (DoIT) to create our testing pipeline. One major strength of our innovation here is the use of self-collection nasal swabs for obtaining specimen, which reduces the need to staff and expose testing center personnel. Additionally, the unique QR code linked to a campus ID allows for participants to register their kit safely and securely such that only campus healthcare information technology staff can link the kit back to them and report their test results securely through email. By creating an extraction free direct RT-PCR testing process we estimate the testing facility could manually process about 1000 samples in one day with 6–8 hour turnaround on those samples using only two testing facility staff members working full time. This process could be scaled up dramatically with the use of robotics for RT-PCR plate preparation. The result of this work is the establishment of infrastructure for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive swab-based testing. This testing platform could be used for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, in response to another outbreak or the emergence of a concerning SARS-CoV-2 variant. In addition the platform could rapidly be repurposed for testing for another potential pandemic agent, seasonal illnesses such as influenza, or detection of other infections such as sexually transmitted infections.","['SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19', 'RT-PCR', 'Surveillance']",2023-7-21,COVID,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11460210,"Distribution of HPV genotypes in Mashhad, Iran: insights from a 2022–2023 study","Human papillomavirus (HPV), is one of the main causes of cervical cancer and also one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). HPV is responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer and plays a principal role in causing other cancers including oropharynx, penis, larynx, oral cavity, anus, vulva, and vagina. The study aims to investigate the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes among patients referred to private laboratories in Mashhad, located in the northeast of Iran. 428 samples including 382 females (89.3%) and 46 males (10.7%) between January 10, 2022, and February 11, 2023, in Mashhad, Iran were evaluated to detect HPV and determine its genotypes. Cervical swabs and urine samples were collected from females and males, respectively. Viral DNA was extracted by using a CedExtra purification kit (cedbio, Iran) and viral genotypes were identified with a High + Low Papillomastrip kit (Operon, Spain). Mann Whitney U test and Chi-square test were accomplished for statistical analysis. From the total of 428 participants analyzed, the HPV test result was positive for 129 patients (30.1%) and negative for 299 people (69.9%). Among the participants, 115 female (30.1%) and 14 male (30.4%) were positive for HPV infection. The prevalence of HPV infection among the referring people was about 30%. The most common genotype identified was HPV-6 (10.3%), followed by HPV-16 (8.7%) and HPV-51 (7.7%), the second and third most common genotypes, respectively. Additionally, HPV-39 was detected at a frequency of 6.70%. HPV-11, HPV-61, HPV-91, and HPV-44 with a frequency of 1% were among the least genotypes identified among the patients. In line with the results of this study, the prevalence of HPV genotypes in both genders is 30%. The results likely reflect differences in the prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes, that are less common. Also, HPV-6 and HPV-16 genotypes that are covered by the vaccine had a significant prevalence. On the other hand, with the prevalence of HPV-51 and HPV-39 genotypes in infected people who are not covered by the Gardasil (quadrivalent) vaccine, there is a risk of related cancers in the future.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small circular double-stranded DNA genome, non-enveloped, and identified as the most common sexually transmitted infection (STIs) [ HPV is a substantial contributor to cancers of the anus, vagina, oropharynx, vulva, and almost all cervical cancers [ Latest research indicates that the human papilloma virus appreciably increases the risk of various types of cancer, especially cervical cancer. Vaccination and screening are among the main approaches to prevent and control this virus. Nevertheless, complete information about the frequency of HPV genotypes in different population groups, is not available. Consequently, this investigation was carried out to explore the frequency and spread of HPV genotypes based on genotype groups (high-risk, low-risk, and potentially high-risk) in individuals referring to the private laboratories of Mashhad in northeastern Iran in 2022–2023. In this cross-sectional study, 428 samples, comprising 382 (89.3%) females and 46 (10.7%) males, referred to private laboratories in Mashhad, Iran bbetween January 10, 2022, and February 11, 2023, were assessed for HPV detection and determination of its genotypes distribution. Samples were collected by gynecologists and experienced laboratory personnel, which included tissues or cells in the cervix (Cervical) samples of cervical secretions for females and urine samples for males. Contributors who consented to participate in the study completed the informed consent form (IR.TUMS.SPH.REC.1402.317). Inclusion criteria included females who had abnormal cytological results and whose gynecologists had referred them to the laboratory for diagnostic tests and HPV genotyping or routine checkup. Also, males who had signs suspected of HPV infection or had recently had high-risk sex with an HPV-infected partner were included in this study. Among participants, the age range spanned from 17 to 70 years old. Exclusion criteria were those without consent of participation in the study. Swab samples collected from females were transferred into a vial pre-filled with a liquid-based (Pap-Preps) preservative solution and kept at 2–8 °C until ready for analysis. Also, two urine samples were collected from males, including one first morning urine sample and another midstream urine sample. Finally, all samples collected from participants were stored at 4 °C, and lastly, 1 day after sampling, relevant laboratory tests were performed. All steps before amplification, DNA extraction, and identification of HPV genotypes were executed in the molecular genetics department of the laboratory, in accordance with the protocols specified by the quality control manager and with the administration of RCCV (Research Center of Clinical Virology). HPV-DNA was extracted with a CedExtra purification kit (cedbio, Iran) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. In the next step, the HPV genotype was detected and determined by using the High + Low Papillomastrip kit (Operon, Spain). This kit can detect 19 high-risk genotypes including HPV-16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, 73, and 82 as well as detect 18 low-risk genotypes including HPV-6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 62, 67, 70, 71, 72, 74, 81, 83, 84, and 91. Frequency, median, average and standard deviation were used to describe the data in this study. Mann Whitney U test was performed to test the equality of age and the Chi-square test was performed to test the equality of gender in HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. A significant level was considered as 0.05. The statistical package IBM SPSS-27 was applied for analysis. A total of 428 subjects were analyzed, among them 382 (89.3%) were female and 46 (10.7%) were male. The mean and standard deviation of age were 34.9 and 8.83, respectively. Out of 428 participants, the HPV test result was positive for 129 (30.1%) and negative for 299 (69.9%). Wald’s 95% confidence interval for the portion with positive test result was (25.4%-34.8%). Among female participants, 115 (30.1%) were identified positive for HPV infection (Wald’s 95% CI: 25.4% to 34.8%) and 267 (69.9%) were reported negative, while 14 (30.4%) were reported positive (Wald’s 95% CI: 17.1% to 43.7%), and 32 (69.6%) were negative for HPV infection among male participants. Among the people who referred to the laboratories, the prevalence of HPV infection was about 30%. HPV infection was not related to gender, statistically (Pearson Chi-Square statistic = 0.002, p-value = 0.963) Table  The frequency and distribution of HPV in total and by gender Age in HPV infection groups Consistent with the genotypic groups among HPV-positive individuals, 81 patients (49.4%) had at least one high-risk genotype, 48 patients (29.2%) had at least one low-risk genotype, and 35 patients (21.3%) had at least one potential high-risk genotype. The results showed that the males examined in this study only had low-risk genotypes. Among the participants, 101 (78.3%) had only one group of genotypes (low-risk, high-risk, or potential high-risk) (Fig.  Schematic frequency and distribution in terms of percentage of genotypic groups (High-risk, Low-risk, or potentially high-risk) identified in infected people Among 89 people (69%) with one genotype, 75 (84.3%) were female and 14 (15.7%) were male. Also, 40 patients (31%) with several HPV genotypes were identified, none of them were male. Among females with infection, 25 were identified as having two genotypes, and the highest number of genotypes identified among patients was 5 genotypes, which were identified in 3 females (2.3%). The most frequent genotype among the identified genotypes is HPV-6 (10.30%), followed by HPV-16 (8.7%), HPV-51 (7.7%), and HPV-39 (6.7%) among the four genotypes. On the other hand, HPV-11, HPV-61, HPV-91, and HPV-44 with a frequency of 1%, and HPV-18, HPV-40, HPV-84, HPV-83, and HPV-67 with a frequency of 0.5%, were among the lowest identified genotypes (Fig.  Distribution and frequency by genotypes observed in HPV-positive patients in both genders Our study reveals several significant findings regarding HPV infection and genotype distribution among the participants in Mashhad. We found that 30.1% of the 428 subjects tested positive for HPV, with no significant gender differences in infection rates (p-value = 0.963). The mean age of participants was 34.9 years, with HPV-positive individuals having a slightly lower mean age compared to those who were HPV-negative, and this difference was statistically significant ( Regardless of age, marital status, or socioeconomic status, unpublished data from Iran shows that during the past ten years, the number of sexually active Iranians with genital tract HPV infection has rapidly increased [ In line with the results of our study, which reported the prevalence of HPV in infected females was 30.1%, another study conducted in Tehran on 12,076 females reported an overall HPV infection prevalence of 38.68% [ These particular observations in Mashhad may be attributed to several reasons. As the capital of Khorasan Razavi province in northeastern Iran, Mashhad stands as the country's second most populous city after Tehran. This prominence results in patients from other cities being referred to Mashhad's medical facilities. Additionally, the city attracts millions of pilgrims annually from across Iran and other Muslim nations, which may also contribute to the findings observed in this study. Another significant contributing factor is the extremely low rate of HPV vaccination. In Iran, HPV vaccines are distributed by private entities, with no coverage or financial support from insurance companies. As a result, many individuals cannot afford the vaccine, making it inaccessible to a large portion of the population [ It's important to highlight that our study has several limitations. The limitation of our study is that since the HPV typing test is not available in all parts of the country and is expensive, it is impossible to properly compare the genotypes in our study divided by cities. In addition, larger-scale studies with more variables and larger populations are needed to acquire more precise results regarding HPV prevalence. The results of our study can be generalized to low- and middle-income countries, where screening and vaccination strategies should be more sensitive, and proper management should be done according to the genotypes in the rotation. Another limitation of our study is the potential for selection bias, as the data were collected from individuals referred to private laboratories. This specific population may not be fully representative of the general population, as individuals visiting private laboratories might differ in terms of socioeconomic status, health-seeking behavior, or other demographic factors. These differences could influence the findings and limit the generalizability of our results. Therefore, the outcomes of this study should be interpreted with caution, and further research is recommended to validate these findings in a more diverse and representative population. As well, a potential issue in our study is the inconsistency in HPV detection rates due to the different sample collection methods employed for females and males. Cervical swabs were used for females, whereas urine samples were collected from males. These differing methods may not be equally effective in detecting HPV, which could result in discrepancies in detection rates between genders. It is crucial to note that the laboratories involved in the study followed specific protocols that we could not alter. As a result, our analysis was based solely on the data provided by these laboratories, and this methodological difference should be considered when interpreting the findings. In conclusion, the findings of our research show that the prevalence of HPV genotypes is 30% in both sexes. For example, although a significant prevalence of the HPV-6 genotype was seen in both sexes, another low-risk genotype (HPV-11) was not extensively detected among the participants. On the other hand, although the HPV-18 genotype was among the 5 genotypes that had the lowest prevalence, HPV-16, HPV-51, and HPV-39 genotypes were among the most common high-risk genotypes identified among the participants. These results probably show the difference in the prevalence of high-risk genotypes that are less common in this city. The findings of this study still emphasize the continuation of further investigations regarding the prevalence of HPV. Determining the prevalence of high-risk genotypes is critical for cancer prevention and improving screening strategies. Furthermore, the high prevalence of HR-HPV genotypes, especially the genotypes not covered by the vaccine, highlights the need to create and improve targeted educational programs to use safer sex methods and encourage the general population to promote vaccination.","['Human papillomavirus (HPV)', 'HPV prevalence', 'Viral genotyping', 'Sexually transmitted infections']",2024-10-7,Virology Journal,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11459845,"Cervical cancer screening service utilisation and related factors among women on antiretroviral therapy in public health facilities of Asella town, Ethiopia, cross-sectional study","Cervical cancer is the predominant form of cancer in Ethiopia, accounting for the majority of malignant cases. Women account for two-thirds of cancer-related deaths in the country. Cervical cancer screening (CCS) can help prevent disease development, but screening rates are unacceptably low. The greatest number of women were in the most vulnerable group, and the availability of wheal data on their use of CCSs was limited. This study aimed to evaluate the use of CCS and the factors that influence its use among HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities. This study used a cross-sectional study design. A total of 396 (97.5%) HIV-positive women participated in this study between March 10 and May 30, 2023. Participants enrolled in public health facilities in Asella town were selected through systematic random sampling, and data were collected through on-site interviews using a pretested, structured questionnaire. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science, Version 26. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determining factors. The findings from this study indicated that 30.3% of individuals used cervical cancer screening services. Those women who had knowledge about cervical cancer had a 2.54 times greater likelihood of receiving CCS than those who were not informed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = (2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42–4.56). Women with a history of sexually transmitted diseases were twice as likely to use CCS as those without such a history (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.13–3.73). Furthermore, women with a positive attitude towards CCS were found to be significant predictors of utilisation, showing a greater than threefold greater likelihood of using these services (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.78–5.81). The proportion of HIV-positive women who underwent cervical cancer screening (CCS) was significantly lower than the recommended guideline of 80%. To enhance the uptake of screening among women with HIV, healthcare professionals should focus on enhancing awareness about cervical cancer, improving attitudes towards CCS, and advancing knowledge about the disease. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-024-10003-0.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiological agent responsible for the development of cervical cancer (CC), a disease affecting reproductive organs [ Cervical cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer and the 2nd most common female cancer in women aged 15 to 44 years globally [ The primary causes of the high incidence of cervical cancer are early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, HIV infection, history of STIs, HPV infection, smoking, limited access to early detection resources, and inadequate HPV vaccination coverage [ In response to the growing incidence of cervical cancer, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging global collaborative efforts to eliminate the disease. Eradication entails decreasing the number of new cases to less than 4 per 100,000 women annually through regular screening [ In Ethiopia, however, there is limited utilization of HPV screening, and the barriers to this have not been fully examined, especially in our region. These insights are essential for enhancing healthcare professionals’ awareness and pinpointing the health facilities offering cervical cancer screening services. This study sought to evaluate the current use of HPV screening among HIV-positive women and determine the factors that may influence it. The study was conducted in Asella town, southeast Ethiopia. In the study area, 1 government referral hospital, 2 general hospitals, and 2 health centres provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) services. The study was carried out between April 10 and May 10, 2023. An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used. All HIV-positive women who were receiving ART were followed up in Asella town public health facilities. All HIV-positive women who attended ART follow-up clinics in Asella town public health facilities during the study period composed the study population. A total of 695 study participants were selected from public health facilities. All HIV-positive women aged 15 to 49 years were included in the study. HIV-positive women who were unable to be interviewed because of severe health problems such as mental problems, who were critically sick, or who had hearing defects at the time of data collection were excluded from the study. There are 3 public health institutions in Asella town. Currently, two of the institutions, Asella Referral Hospital and Asella Health Centre were the only public health facilities that provided services for ART and CCS. There were 3850 patients currently enrolled in an ART clinic at Asella Referral Hospital; 2399 (62.3%) of these patients were women, and 1763 (73.5%) of these patients were eligible for the study. Approximately 844 patients from the Asella Health Centre were enrolled in the ART-Clinic, of whom 551 (65.3%) were women and 426 (32%) were eligible for this study period. For the first objective, the sample size was determined using Epi info version 7.2.5. Accordingly, the sample size was calculated by considering the following assumptions: the proportion of CCS service utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive women attending adult ART clinics in public health facilities in Hawassa town, Ethiopia, 2019, was 40.1% [ The sample size was proportionally allocated to these health institutions based on the average of three months of ART client flow prior to the data collection. The total population for these health institutions (their average monthly ART flows were estimated to be 695) (630 for Asella Hospital and 65 for Asella Health Centre). Then, the calculated sample size was proportionally allocated to the size of the clients of the two health institutions by the rule of probability proportional to size sampling. Finally, the study participants were selected from each health institution using a systematic random sampling technique (i.e., Kth = N/sample size = > 695/406 ≈ 2, which means Kth = 2); thus, every 2nd mother was recruited as a study unit in each health facility until the total sample size for this study was obtained.

A  Ten items were used to measure knowledge of cervical cancer screening. First, we assign a response code of 1 for the right response and a code of 0 for the incorrect response. After that, we added all of the answers to the knowledge questions to determine a final score of 10. The mean was computed using the results of 10 knowledge assessment questions. The expected scores ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum. After calculating the overall score for each participant, we summed all the overall scores and divided the result by the total number of participants. Then, we classified poor knowledge as those whose mean knowledge score was below the obtained mean and good knowledge as those whose score was equal to or above the mean [ Eight questions were used to gauge attitudes toward cervical cancer screening using a Likert scale. Participants’ responses were used to determine the following scoring system: strongly agree, 5; agree, 4; neither agree nor disagree, 3; disagree, 2; and strongly disagree, 1. All of the recoded attitude responses were combined by adding each response to obtain an overall score of 8. This is the mean of the Likert scale dichotomous to disagree and agree, which is calculated by merging strongly agree and agree recorded as “1” and all other values (strongly disagree, disagree, and neutral) by decoding “0.” The expected scores ranged from 0 to 8, with 8 being the maximum. After determining the mean score, respondents were classified as having either a favourable or unfavourable attitude depending on whether they scored above or below the mean [ The questionnaires were prepared in the English language and translated to Afaan Oromo by a language expert to check consistency. The questionnaires were adapted after reviewing different relevant literature [ The questionnaire was translated from English to Afaan Oromo and back to English by a language expert to assure its consistency. The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the total sample size in the Huruta Health Centre, which is located 40 km away from the study area, and the data collection tool was modified in terms of sequence, grammar and how to conduct interviews. One day of training was given to the data collectors and supervisors regarding the aim of the study, the data collection tool and the procedures of the questionnaires. Supervision was provided by the Principal Investigator and Supervisor. All completed data collection forms were examined for completeness and consistency during the data collection period.

Binary logistic regression was used to assess the associations between independent variables and dependent variables. Variables with a  A total of 396 HIV-positive women participated in the study, yielding a 97.5% response rate. After normality was verified, the respondents’ mean age was 32.8 years, and the standard deviation (SD) was 8.68, with a range of 20 to 49 years. In terms of marital status, 261 respondents (65.9%) were married. Additionally, approximately 278 (70.2%) of the participants were urban dwellers. Of the study participants, 234 (64.1%) belonged to the Oromo ethnic group. Regarding their religion, 183 (46.2%) respondents were Orthodox, and 153 (38.36%) were Muslim. (Table  
 Sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive women in Asella town public health facilities in Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 The proportion of women with HIV who underwent CCS in Asella town was 120 (30.3%). The primary reason for not screening for CC among women was their perception of their health (157, 56.9%), followed by lack of knowledge (70, 25.4%). Approximately 340 (85.9%) women had a history of pregnancy. One hundred seventy-eight (52.4%) women were multipara, followed by 89 (26.2%) who were primiparous. Only 8 (2%) women had a family history of CC. Approximately 57 (16.8%) women had experienced abortion at least once in their lifetime (Table

 Attitudes toward cervical cancer screening among HIV-positive mothers in Asella town public health facilities, Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 The bivariate binary logistic regression analysis used a total of eight variables. Age, educational status, occupational status, parity, history of sexually transmitted infections, information provided by health professionals, knowledge status, and attitudes were associated with the use of cervical cancer screening among women who were HIV positive, with  Mothers with a secondary education or higher were 2.39 times more likely to use cervical cancer screening than mothers without a formal education (AOR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.22–4.67). Mothers with a history of STIs were twice as likely to have undergone cervical cancer screening as mothers who had never had a history of STIs (AOR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.13–3.73). If participants had a positive attitude toward the procedure, they were three times more likely to use cervical cancer screening than if they had a negative attitude (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.78–5.81). Mothers with good knowledge were 2.54 times more likely to use cervical cancer screening than mothers with poor knowledge (AOR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.42–4.56). (Table  
 Factors associated with cervical cancer screening utilization among HIV-positive mothers in Asella town public health facilities, Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 Note:  The objective of this study was to evaluate the utilization of cervical cancer screening services among women with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities in Asella town. Based on recent survey data, it was found that 30.3% of women living with HIV received cervical cancer screenings. This rate is considerably higher than the 7.8% in the Tigray Region [ Our research findings reveal that cervical cancer screening rates are suboptimal in countries with comparable ecological and economic circumstances. In South Africa, the screening rate for women stands at 65% [ In this study, mothers who were HIV positive and had completed at least secondary school were 2.39 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than mothers who had not received any formal education. Similar studies conducted in Ethiopia, specifically in the nation [ Women with HIV and a history of STIs were more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than were those without a history of STIs. Studies conducted at Adama Hospital and Medical College yielded similar findings [ In HIV-positive women, having a thorough understanding of cervical cancer increased the likelihood of using screening services by 2.56 times compared to those with limited knowledge. Previous studies in Tanzania [ The utilization of cervical cancer screening among HIV-positive women was found to be lower than recommended. Factors such as educational status, history of sexually transmitted diseases, knowledge of cervical cancer, and attitudes towards screening were significant predictors of whether women received screenings. Asella referral hospitals and Asella health centre should focus on increasing awareness and educating HIV-positive women on the importance of screening. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. Despite all these rates falling below the recommended levels of CCS utilisation in different public health services, implication to the improvements of ultimately in a short period of time are uncertain in our facility, in our country and even in Sub-Saharan Region. The Ministry of Health and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations should also launch educational campaigns using various mass media platforms to address negative attitudes towards screening and promote uptake among HIV-positive women. We were able to determine the most important diseases and population conditions from extensive reviews to the most recent WHO recommendations, which urge frequent cervical cancer assessments of high-risk groups every two years as important, especially for women who are HIV positive. However, our study used a cross-sectional study design that did not show a cause-and-effect relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

11459292,"Schistosomiasis infections in South African pregnant women: A
review","Schistosomiasis, a chronic parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species, has a
negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and child development. The disease affects over
230 million people worldwide, and in South Africa an estimated 5.2 million people are
thought to be infected. However, there is scant data on the impact of schistosomiasis in
pregnancy in South Africa and globally. The aim of this review was to analyse the
current knowledge of schistosomiasis in pregnancy, particularly in South Africa,
focusing on maternal and neonatal complications linked directly to the disease or its
treatment. An electronic search of online databases was used to identify and collect relevant
research articles related to schistosomiasis in pregnancy, with a focus on South
Africa. Schistosomiasis can cause severe organ damage when left untreated and influences
maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Although South Africa’s first
helminth control programme was established in 1997, there is currently no ongoing
treatment strategy programme, and little information is available on prevalence rates in
pregnant women for the last 20 years. There is also an absence of data from
well-controlled clinical trials that focus on the efficacy and safety of treatment
during pregnancy, which has led to this vulnerable group being neglected. This review highlights the dearth of information on the impact of schistosomiasis in
pregnant women in South Africa and the need for high-quality evidence-based studies.","Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a common chronic disease caused by parasitic infection with
trematodes of the genus  The disease is endemic to Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Schistosomiasis is endemic to some regions of South Africa (SA). While research on schistosomiasis in children is critical, other vulnerable groups should
also be considered. These children will become adults, half of whom will fall pregnant.
Research on the prevalence or treatment in women of reproductive age and during pregnancy is
scarce globally, and equally true in SA. Although women of reproductive age are at less risk to infection than their male
counterparts, chronic exposure and infection may lead to overt and long-term sequelae during
and after pregnancy. While most mitigation efforts focus on morbidity control and elimination strategies in
children, an awareness and implementation of treatment strategies is of vital importance in
pregnant women as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed prophylactic
chemotherapy as a treatment strategy that focuses on reducing disease through regular,
targeted treatment of affected populations. The objective of this review is to summarise the existing literature on schistosomiasis in
pregnant women and to identify research gaps relating to schistosomiasis, particularly in
SA. There are three main species of  Overview of the various activities associated with  An electronic search of the following databases was conducted: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google
Scholar and Scopus. The search terms included schistosomiasis, bilharzia, pregnancy,
pregnant, gestation, women and South Africa. Boolean terms (AND, OR) were used to separate
the keywords, and Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms were included during the search.
Websites such as the WHO and governmental websites were searched for policies and guidelines
regarding diagnosis and management of anaemia in pregnancy. Relevant studies were identified
by searching literature from January 1985 to date. Articles were also searched through the
‘Cited by’ search as well as citations included in the reference lists of
included articles. The search strategy was piloted to check the appropriateness of selected electronic
databases and key words. A PubMed search using MeSH terms ‘Schistosomiasis’
and ‘South Africa’ and filtered for studies involving humans returned 495
articles with no restrictions on date of publication. Eligibility criteria for selection of
articles included being available in full text and related to schistosomiasis in pregnancy,
and involve South African pregnant women. An initial title screening reduced the number of articles to 76, and from this pool,
relevant articles were gleaned for necessary information. Schistosomiasis is endemic to SA and poses a challenge to public health. According to the
WHO ( Estimates of the South African population requiring preventive chemotherapy for
schistosomiasis. PC, preventive chemotherapy; SAC, school age children; SCH, schistosomiasis. Note: SAC population requiring PC for SCH annually: estimated number of school age
children requiring preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis annually according to
the recommended strategy. Population requiring PC for SCH annually: estimated number

according to the recommended strategy. While some studies on schistosomiasis prevalence rates were undertaken in endemic regions
of SA (depicted in  Schistosomiasis risk areas in South Africa. Pregnant women, particularly those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
are at increased risk for significant maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality, because
of multiple contributing factors. Schistosomiasis causes an array of adverse outcomes in pregnant women. Extracorporeal blood loss when eggs are shed through the gut wall ( Schistosomiasis can cause maternal, placental and foetal infection. Schistosomiasis also impacts future pregnancies, and  Despite the many case reports and studies that have shown an association of female
genital tract infection with schistosomiasis in pregnant populations, Colley et al. reported that globally,  Despite the large risk they present to both mother and child, very limited
epidemiological data on schistosomiasis are available for the reproductive phase of life
in SA. Most interventions and research conducted in SA focus on school children, There is little evidence of the effects of schistosomiasis in pregnant women in SA. A
recent study showed a prevalence of  Schistosomiasis can be treated, and snail reduction has shown to benefit endemic
populations. Currently, PZQ is the only drug recommended for the regular treatment of
schistosomiasis, The lack of sufficient, well-controlled studies on the use of PZQ in pregnant and lactating
women has deterred many countries (including SA) from using this drug during
pregnancy. Schistosomiasis is a public health concern in SA with approximately a tenth of the
population at risk. There is significant evidence implicating schistosomiasis directly in
maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality, and indirectly by causing nutrient deficiencies
leading to anaemia and malnutrition or by association with other co-morbidities such as HIV
and TB. However, very little data exist on schistosomiasis amongst pregnant women in SA.
Research on the distribution and prevalence of schistosomiasis, as well as frequent and
consistent surveillance and intervention programmes that target all population groups,
especially pregnant women, will contribute significantly to controlling this
disease. High-quality evidence-based studies assessing the impact of schistosomiasis on pregnancy
are urgently required to support global intervention and treatment programmes in pregnant
and lactating women and their babies.","['schistosomiasis', 'pregnancy', 'parasites', 'praziquantel', 'South Africa']",2020-9-23,Southern African Journal of Infectious Diseases,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11453092,Patterns of inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behaviors among female sex workers in Mozambique,"Female sex workers (FSWs) in Mozambique face significant health risks, including high HIV prevalence, combination of factors, including inconsistent condom use, engagement in risky sexual behaviors, and various socio-ecological determinants of health. Understanding the determinants of these practices is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the second round of Biobehavioral Survey (BBS) conducted from 2019 to 2020 in five urban areas to examine determinants of inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behaviors among FSWs. Modified Poisson regression models were used to assess the effect of various socio-demographic, economic, and behavioral factors on the outcomes, providing adjusted relative risk (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among the 2,565 FSWs who reported inconsistent condom use, younger FSWs (15–24 years old, 29.1%), single (27.3%), with secondary or higher education (26.1%), nationals (25.9%), and residents of Tete City (30.5%) had a higher prevalence of inconsistent condom use. Initiating sex work < 18 years (31.0%), binge drinking (23.7%), and experiencing physical violence (29.0%) were significantly associated with this behavior. Among the 2,564 FSWs reporting risky sexual behaviors, a higher prevalence was observed in FSWs aged 15–24 (75.6%), those with secondary or higher education (75.8%), nationals (74.4%), and those residing in Quelimane (87.3%). Early sexual debut (< 15 years, 79.3%), initiating sex work before 18 years of age (77.7%), and illicit drug use (82.2%) were all associated with increased risky sexual practices. Inconsistent condom use among FSWs was significantly associated with residing in Tete (aRR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.77–3.25), not being aware of female condom (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45) and having experienced sexual a physical violence. Moreover, being married was significantly linked to risky sexual behavior among female sex workers (aRR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.19–1.37), along with initiating sexual activity before age 15, having at least five years of sex work experience, engaging in binge drinking, and experiencing sexual and physical violence. The study highlights the complex set of factors as age, education, geographic location, years of sex work services, early sexual debut, and illicit drug use that influence sexual risks behavior among FSWs in Mozambique. Tailored interventions addressing not only sexual health education and services, but also economic empowerment and illicit drug use is imperative for mitigating these risks.

In 2022, the prevalence of HIV among FSWs was four times that of the general adult population (aged 15–49 years), highlighting a significant public health challenge among this key population [ Effective HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention critically relies heavily on using condoms correctly and consistently during sexual activities. While there are multiple prevention methods available, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), condom use remains a key strategy for reducing HIV transmission, particularly among high-risk populations like FSWs. Condoms offer a dual protection advantage, reducing the risk of both HIV and other STIs.​ However, FSWs often struggle to negotiate condom use due to power imbalances with their male clients, who are their main source of income [ The global ambition to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, as outlined by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), underscores the vital role of comprehensive prevention strategies, including widespread condom use [ Mozambique, in particular, faces one of the world’s most severe HIV epidemics. The Mozambique Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA), INSIDA 2021, reports an HIV prevalence of 12.5%, rising to 15.4% among women of reproductive age [ The country has been implementing a variety of intervention programs aimed at curbing HIV transmission among FSWs. These include promoting HIV counseling and testing, as well as enhancing condom use, and providing targeted education on safer sex practices ​ [ Previous studies conducted in Mozambique among this population have found that inconsistent condom use is prevalent among FSWs, influenced by clients’ refusal to use condoms and the higher payments offered for unprotected sex [ In Southern Africa, particularly Mozambique, sex work walks a tightrope. The legal system doesn’t explicitly criminalize it, but related activities pose constant risk of arrest. This ambiguity creates fear, pushing FSWs to operate in the shadows [ Condom negotiation with male clients is crucial for the safety of FSWs and plays a significant role in their overall ability to prevent HIV transmission. The current study aims to assess the associations of FSWs’ characteristics with inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behaviors during the second round of the BBS conducted in Mozambique from 2019 to 2020. Understanding these associations is vital to improve preventive interventions, informing policy formulation and program design that could significantly enhance the health outcomes of FSWs and their communities. To investigate the factors associated with inconsistent condom use and risky sexual practice among FSW in Mozambique, we utilized data from the second round of the BBS conducted in 2019–2020, collected through a standardized structured questionnaire that was based on the WHO 2017 bio-behavioral survey guidelines for populations at risk of HIV [ This cross-sectional survey was designed to gather a wide range of information on socio-demographic characteristics, behavioral factors related to HIV (e.g., sexual history, condom use, alcohol and other illicit drug use), other STI, and access to health services and healthcare-seeking behavior. FSWs participating in the study were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a peer recruitment methodology that is particularly effective for reaching high-risk and hidden populations [ Data collection was carried out by trained interviewers who administered face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire in a private and confidential setting. The interviews were conducted at designated study sites, chosen based on accessibility and convenience for the participants. Prior to the interview, informed consent was obtained from all participants. The structured questionnaire was designed to minimize recall bias and social desirability bias by asking clear, specific questions. The data collected were then entered into a secure database, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Further details regarding the survey methodology, including sample size calculation and the application of the RDS methodology, are provided elsewhere [ The study recruited 419 FSW in Maputo, 521 in Beira, 519 in Tete, 514 in Quelimane, and 519 in Nampula. The sample size calculation for each city followed the WHO 2017 bio-behavioral survey guidelines for key populations [ The present study aims to analyze two primary outcomes: inconsistent condom uses with clients and risky sexual behavior. The classification of sexual behavior as “risky” can vary depending on cultural, gender, age differences, and defined thresholds [ The risky sexual behavior outcome was built upon the combination of different aspects related to FSWs’ HIV risk behaviors and vulnerability. FSWs were considered to  Exploratory variables considered in this study were chosen based on previous empirical studies and their availability in the dataset [ For this study, we employed bivariate and multivariate analysis. The bivariate analysis was used to present the prevalence of the outcome variables with respect to socio-demographics and other sex work related variables and to identify potential candidate variables for the multivariate analysis. Moreover, we used Pearson’s Chi-square test to assess the association between the outcome variables and the explanatory variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression with robust standard errors, also termed modified Poisson regression, to identify socio-demographic and sex work related characteristic that influence the outcome variables. Though the outcome variables are binary, modified Poisson regression was applied as this approach has been proved to be suitable for common outcomes [ Herein, the results are presented in the form of percentages and adjusted risk ratio accompanied with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). All the analyses were conducted using the R statistical software version 4.2.2 [ In our study, we analyzed data from 2,565 FSWs participants who reported inconsistent condom use (Table  FSWs participants from Tete City showed the highest rate of inconsistent condom use (30.5%,  Additionally, FSWs who do not engage in other forms of work besides sex work, and those with a large volume of sexual clients (3–4 clients) reported higher rates of inconsistent condom use at 26.9% and 28.3%. The analysis also identified that illicit drug use, and experiences of violence as critical factors related to condom use among FSWs. Binge drinking was significantly associated with inconsistent condom use, with a prevalence of 23.7% ( We also analyzed 2,564 FSWs participants for risky sexual behavior (Table  FSWs participants who reported their first sexual encounter before the age of 15 (79.3%,  
 Association between socio-demographic and sex work-related characteristics with inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs, Mozambique 2019-20 Modified Poisson regression shows that inconsistent use of condom is significantly related to site of study, knowledge of female condom, experience of sexual and physical (Table  Geographic differences were pronounced; FSWs participants from Beira, Tete, Quelimane, and Nampula exhibited a significantly higher risk of inconsistent condom use than those from Maputo, with Tete showing the most substantial risk (aRR = 2.40, 95% CI:1.77–3.25). Furthermore, the results reveal that FSWs who were not aware of female condom were more likely to report inconsistent condom use (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03–1.45). The results further revealed that FSWs who reported ever experiencing sexual violence were 38% more likely to report inconsistent condom use when compared to those who never experienced sexual violence (aRR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.19–1.61). Similarly, FSWs who reported ever experiencing physical violence had a higher risk of engaging in inconsistent condom use as compared to FSWs who never had an event of physical violence (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05–1.42). From the results, it is also observed that, although not significant, FSWs who use illicit drugs are more likely to report inconsistent condom use. Likewise, FSWs who do not have a comprehensive knowledge of HIV have a higher risk of reporting inconsistent condom use. With regards to risky sexual behavior, the results show that married FSWs have a higher likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior when compared to non-married FSWs (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05–1.42). The results also show that the risk of engaging in risky sexual practices is higher among FSWs from the city of Tete, Quelimane and Nampula as compared to FSWs from Maputo city. Moreover, the results show that FSWs who initiated sexual activity after the age of 15 were less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior (aRR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.99). The results further show that FSWs with five or more years of sex work are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior when compared to those with less than three years of sex work service (aRR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03–1.19). FSWs who use illicit drugs also have a higher likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors (aRR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00-1.14). On the other hand, the results show that FSWs who do not consume alcohol abusively have a lower risk of engaging in risky sexual behavior (aRR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.97). Moreover, we note that FSWs who experienced sexual violence have an increased likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior (aRR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.12). 
 Multiple modified Poisson regression model for inconsistent condom uses and risky sexual behavior Our study has identified several significant determinants that influence inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs, highlighting the complexity of factors that contribute to sexual health risks in this population. These factors include the interplay of individual-level characteristics, social and environmental factors, and negotiation dynamics that contribute to unsafe sexual practices in this population. In the first BBS conducted in the country, a condom was used during the last sexual encounter with the most recent client by 85.8% of FSW in Maputo, 73.4% in Beira, and 62.8% in Nampula, while approximately half of FSW used a condom with their most recent non-client partner [ Our findings indicate a significant association between age and both inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs, with younger FSWs (15–24 years old) exhibiting higher rates of both outcomes, which may reflect a combination of factors, including lower negotiation power, limited experience in managing client interactions, and greater economic vulnerability. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown younger FSWs are at higher risk for inconsistent condom use and sexual health risks due to similar socioeconomic and behavioral factors [ The study further identified the geographic location as a significant factor, with FSW in cities such as Beira, Tete, Quelimane, and Nampula being more likely to report inconsistent condom use than those in Maputo City. This geographic disparity may mirror the regional differences in the availability and accessibility of condoms and sexual health services, as well as variations in commercial sex practices prevalent in these areas, such as street-based sex work versus brothel-based sex work, which can affect access to condoms [ Our analysis reveals a significant association between the age of sexual initiation and both inconsistent condom uses and risky sexual behaviors among FSWs. Specifically, FSWs who initiated sexual activity at a younger age demonstrated higher likelihood of inconsistent condom use and engagement in risky sexual behaviors. Early sexual initiation may lead to entrenched behavior patterns that persist into adulthood, making it difficult to adopt protective practices later in life. This prolonged exposure to environments where risky behaviors are normalized can result in a lower likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors due to limited sexual health knowledge and reduced capacity to negotiate condom use. Additionally, younger initiators may experience more coercive or exploitative sexual relationships, which further hinders their ability to insist on condom use. These findings emphasize the critical need for interventions targeting young individuals to provide comprehensive sexuality education, aiming to delay sexual debut and promote safer sexual practices from an early age [ Illicit drug consumption was found to be associated with both inconsistent condom uses and higher engagement in risky sexual behavior. Illicit drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, leading to increased vulnerability and risk of STIs, including HIV among FSW. This correlation has been well-documented in previous research, where illicit drug use among FSWs has been identified as a key factor contributing to heightened sexual and health risks [ Our findings demonstrate a significant association between experiences of violence and both inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs. FSWs who had experienced physical violence were more likely to engage in inconsistent condom use, while those who had experienced sexual violence were more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. These results align with previous research, which highlights that violence, particularly physical and sexual, compromises the ability of FSWs to negotiate safer sexual practices, leading to increased vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV [ Our study, while providing valuable insights into the factors influencing inconsistence condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs, is not without limitations. Our study uses a pooled sample and RDS methodology, which, while effective for reaching hidden populations like FSWs, may introduce biases related to network size and the homophily within participant networks and also may mask variations and specificities within subgroups of the FSW population. The cross-sectional design restricts our ability to infer causality between identified determinants and sexual health outcomes. Additionally, reliance on self-reported data may introduce bias, as participants might underreport behaviors perceived as socially undesirable or stigmatized or may suffer from recall bias. Despite these constraints, the findings offer a critical foundation for future research and the development of targeted interventions aimed at improving the sexual health and well-being of FSWs. Priority areas for future research should include age-specific interventions, addressing substance use and sexual behavior, improving healthcare accessibility, and understanding the economic and cultural factors that influence condom use and sexual health practices among FSWs. By focusing on these areas, future research can better address the multifaceted challenges faced by FSWs and contribute to more effective public health strategies and interventions. This study highlights the complex factors influencing inconsistent condom use and risky sexual behavior among FSWs in Mozambique, underscoring the significant roles of geographic location, age at sexual debut, years in sex work, illicit drug use, and experiences of violence. These findings underscore the pressing need for a comprehensive public health approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this high-risk population. Tailored interventions should include sexual health education, improved access to prevention resources, substance use treatment, and socio-economic support. By tackling the interconnected socio-demographic, behavioral, and economic factors contributing to vulnerability, we can reduce the sexual health risks among FSWs and support broader public health and social equity goals. Collaborative efforts between policymakers, community-based organizations, healthcare providers, and FSWs themselves are crucial to designing and implementing strategies that meaningfully improve sexual health outcomes for this population.

11451726,"The potential of a hygiene-based message, preferred learning modalities, and *iLubricarte, Liberarte, Lavarte+!” or L 3 + for the prevention of HIV/STI in Peru","Hygiene-based practices of lubrication, genital cleansing, postcoital urination, and rectal douching are common behaviors among populations at higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infections (STI). Yet, the role these behaviors have on HIV/STI risk has not been well elucidated, especially among transgender women (TW) and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Additionally, advances in biomedical strategies have heralded a new era of HIV/AIDS prevention that may be accompanied by behavioral changes that lead to decreases in condom usage and subsequent changes to STI sequelae. Nevertheless, many people at higher risk are not benefiting equally from these options, strengthening the need for more sustainable, evidence-based methods. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices, proven preventative methods, and preferred learning methods among Peruvian TW and GBMSM. 30 interviews and 50 questionnaires were conducted with TW (N=35), GBMSM (N=35), healthcare providers (N=5), and key community informants (N=5). Most participants perceived hygiene-based practices to be common behaviors and a significant aspect of sexual wellbeing. Educational materials utilizing social media and hosting in-person events were also viewed favorably, with value to enhancing HIV/STI knowledge. Several barriers to autonomy surfaced in the data, including systemic disparities to adequate HIV/STI services, top vs. bottom social dynamics, and PrEP accessibility issues. Continued work is needed to address the barriers to the acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of hygiene-based practices, biomedical/barrier strategies, and ","Hygiene-based and other related practices in people assigned male at birth is a forgotten area of research that may prove to be important for HIV/STI prevention [ Understanding common behaviors and attitudes that impact sexual health is essential to inform the development of effective sexual health interventions [ Utilizing a mixed methods research design, this formative project was an exploratory study between November 2022 and December 2023 that primarily assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and proven biomedical/barriers strategies of Peruvian TW and GBMSM. Preferences for learning and educational messaging modalities were also explored to inform the conceptualization of a future intervention in close collaboration with proven biomedical and barrier strategies. Participants were recruited from public health centers, initially at  The eligibility criteria for TW and GBMSM included  A mix of TW (N = 10), GBMSM (N = 10), HCPs (N = 5), and KCIs (N = 5) were first asked to schedule and participate in a face-to-face, semi-structured interview in safe spaces of affiliated organizations. The themes used in the interviews were referenced from the Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) Model, the Health Belief Model, and the core components of acceptability and feasibility [ Following a preliminary analysis of the interview transcripts, TW (N = 25) and GBMSM (N = 25) were asked to complete an online, self-completed questionnaire via  First-generating descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the questionnaires and describe the characteristics of our sample. Most questions were scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Some questions were open-ended, and to further personalize one’s response, participants could choose multiple answer choices and input a typed response. Answer choices of all open-ended questions were randomized to decrease bias. All participants had the option to refuse to answer any question. Thematic analysis techniques were employed to code and analyze the interviews. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, translated from Peruvian Spanish to English, coded, and analyzed. The coding framework developed to elicit the themes within each interview was consistently refined and systematically reviewed as it applied to the data. 36% (18/50) of survey participants completed secondary or technical school, and 14% (7/50) completed university. 41% (20/49) of participants were unemployed, and 65% (28/43) made under S/1000 a month. 45% (21/47) lived alone, and 42% (21/50) shared bathroom facilities (such as a toilet, sink, or shower) at least most of the time with household or community members. 26% (13/50) felt it would be at least somewhat difficult to get the support they need from others (such as friends, family, and HCPs) to practice HIV-preventative methods.
 “I have testimonies from boys and girls here who tell me that the nurse told me that the ampoule I am going to give you is going to hurt, but that happens because you do things you shouldn’t do” Many interview participants described significant, unaddressed inequities experienced among local TW and GBMSM. These disparities ranged from inattention, inactivity, stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization in many aspects of life. There is also awareness of sociopolitical disparities faced by TW that result in insecurities in health care, education, income, and nutrition. Because of these disparities and more, a few recognized that sex work was the only means of survival for most TW. Many TW expressed themselves as feeling isolated, excluded, and completely vulnerable to the disinterest of the Peruvian government and most of its citizens. In the last 3 months, the majority (76%, 38/50) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of condoms within reach, with 82% (41/50) reporting that they will at least most likely use condoms every time during sexual intercourse. 86% (42/49) of participants were aware of PrEP, but 78% (39/50) had never taken it before. The most common reasons why participants did not use PrEP included 13 participants not having access to PrEP-related services, 12 participants not knowing about the use and benefits of PrEP, and 5 participants expressing concern about potential side effects associated with PrEP use. 3 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from healthcare personnel, and 2 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from family, friends, or colleagues. Among the participants who have taken PrEP before, 55% (6/11) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of PrEP pills. Among those who haven’t used PrEP before, 76% (26/34) are willing to take PrEP every day if proven to reduce HIV risk by at least 90%, and 74% (26/35) are willing to take PrEP every day if it is proven to have few or no side effects. If participants were to hypothetically take PrEP every day, 60% (21/35) would expect to use condoms with the same frequency as before, with 29% (10/35) expecting to use condoms at least less frequently. 53% (18/34) would expect to have about the same number of sexual partners as before, with 21% (7/34) expecting to have at least more sexual partners.
 “… there are many people who are afraid to go buy a condom at the pharmacy or the stigma that they put on us just by hearing the word “condom” because we live in a purely religious country both Catholic and Christian, evangelical and always the subject of condoms, the name condom already sounds strong. It has happened to me, I speak personally, that sometimes I tell a boy: “hey go buy a condom at the pharmacy.” And he tells me: “go buy it yourself.” So, from there I see the connotation that the same gay boys are ashamed to buy a condom in a pharmacy right?… So, I feel that there should be a campaign to remove that fear by saying condom, [because] that it’s like buying gum or going to buy a cigarette, a beer… But, I think we could do with expanding it a little more to include all these little extra things that can help, and the new forms of prevention that are also coming out: PreP, post-exposure [PEP], and all that stuff. I believe that we should give a more extensive, more comprehensive approach to everything that is prevention and not just limit ourselves to saying: “no, just use your condom, use your condom.” Many interview participants reported accessibility issues with PrEP. A few expressed concerns with the side effects associated with PrEP and ART. Some questioned why the Peruvian government hasn’t sponsored public health initiatives that destigmatize condoms and demonstrate the proper techniques of condom usage with water-based lubrication. Many considered hygiene-based practices with the use of condoms and PrEP as an important strategy to reduce the transmission and acquisition of HIV/STI. In the last 3 months, 93% (40/43) cleansed themselves at least most of the time after intercourse. 88% (43/49) were at least most likely to have regular access to a sink or shower with running water after sex. 74% (31/42) typically cleansed themselves within 15 minutes after intercourse. 69% (29/42) cleansed for at least 2 minutes. After washing, 19% (8/43) reported genital wetness. 22 participants used antibacterial soap, 11 used bar soap, and 8 used shampoo to cleanse themselves. 41 participants cleansed to become more hygienic, 19 cleansed to increase their peace of mind, 13 cleansed to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI, and 9 cleansed because it was recommended to them by either a close contact or by healthcare personnel. 69% (34/49) at least knew someone who consistently cleansed their genitals after sex. In the past 3 months, 58% (29/50) were at least most likely to use hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents to clean themselves after sex, and 26% (13/50) sometimes used an alcohol-based cleansing agent to clean themselves after sex. 34 participants used hand wipes, and 10 used alcohol-based hand sanitizer. All participants knew at least someone who consistently used hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents.
 “We always tell men that: “wash your d**k” hahahaha… Really! We tell them in reality, sometimes jokingly, right? But usually when someone approaches me, they approach me like this and I say: “have you bathed? have you washed yourself well?” If he says yes to me and then I discover when he approaches me ready for the sexual act and I perceive “oh, just there, go take a bath, go wash.” If you want and if not bye, nothing happens.” Most interviewees found genital washing to be an essential aspect of both sexual well-being and one’s general bathing process. Although many learned these practices from family members and social circles, many participants questioned this behavior’s utility, efficacy, and proper techniques. A few shared their experiences using wet wipes, especially when bathing facilities were unavailable or during time constraints. For almost all, genital cleansing was an essential aspect of one’s own or their partner’s sex life. In the past 3 months, all participants reported douching at least once before sex. 84% (38/45) had regular access to adequate amenities/supplies (such as running water, enema solution, and enema bottle) for successful douches. 71% (29/41) douched within at least 30 minutes before sex. 39 participants douched to become more clean/hygienic, 30 participants douched to make sex more pleasurable, 23 participants douched to increase their peace of mind, and 16 participants douched due to recommendations from either a close contact or from an HCP. 8 participants douched to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI. 32 participants used a water-based douching solution, 10 used a water-based solution with chamomile, and 3 used a water-based solution with salt or vinegar. 96% (46/48) have never shared enema supplies with sexual partners or other associates. 86% (42/49) knew at least one person who consistently douches before sex. In the past 3 months, 59% (27/46) participants reported douching at least most of the time after sex, with 72% (28/39) douching within at least 30 minutes after sex. 83% (34/41) douched after their most recent sexual activity.
 “This is a very worrying issue, I do this type of anal washing myself, right? More hygienic when you have your sexual relations. The issue is that it harms your health, due to the issue of the PH that we have in that part, right? And well, genital washing is normal, it should be done daily, right? Er, there isn’t as much danger there as in anal washings, which harms you. I see it daily with trans girls, uh, we talk about that, but the issue is also about cleanliness, and many people call it “pumping”, it’s the term used in the community. And they demand: “I want you to pump yourself very well”, and many people demand that kind of thing from them and many times they agree to do those washings. We know that we are harming ourselves, I for my part know it, but sometimes because of the issue of looking good, for a cleanliness issue, we agree. And in trans girls, I have seen that [anal washing] is constant, every day every so often, they even don’t eat many times because they don’t [get dirty], because they have their entire stomachs clean, and they don’t get the other person dirty. That is very worrying, and to improve this, enemas are also used, but really many people due to the issue of access to the enema, it is a bit expensive to use. Mostly they do it just like that with bottles.” Douching was a considerable part of one’s sexual hygiene or that of their partner. There was a diverse range of manifestations and justifications for douching, primarily determined by the sexual position they assumed and the accessibility of proper amenities/supplies. Some recognized their complex relationship with douching and its potential harms. A few participants shared that they significantly decreased their nutritional intake to avoid the presence of fecal remnants during planned intercourse. Some questioned why there are no resources sharing this practice’s potential harms, benefits, and proper techniques.
 “They feel bad, with shame they feel dirty, and the client is upset. And they don’t want that. Once, a man got annoyed with me, I told him to go to hell, I told him: jerk, where the hell are you going? He looked at me [and said]: “is that right?” Yeah dude, what do you think? I pump myself, but it’s not my fault that something was left out there. Don’t come to me with that “wash yourself well, stupid”. And he didn’t call me anymore, and he sent me to hell. And I tell the girls: you don’t have to let yourself be dominated like that. In other words, they are very submissive, and at times I get annoyed and tell them: stop fooling around, don’t let this jerk manipulate you and dominate you. “It’s just that he gives me money, I don’t know what to do.” Turn it around [penetrate him too]. “No, mother” [they reply]. Do it -I tell them- and you’ll see that he’s not going to bother you anymore.” In the last 3 months, 65% (32/49) of participants had access to an adequate amount of lubricant within reach at least most of the time. If participants were to have lube on hand, 82% (41/50) are at least most likely to use lube before or during intercourse. 39 participants used water-based lubricants, 16 used oil-based lubricants or Vaseline, and 9 used saliva. 72% (34/47) at least knew one person who consistently uses lubricants before or during intercourse.
 “There is no facility for that, that is a limitation… a limitation that the state must remedy, we consider it important. Because condoms are good for prevention, that is true, but they are used in areas that are not lubricated because we are talking about sexual practices with trans women, right? And they are used in areas, in the rectum, an area that is not lubricated, that is in itself a little dry, it will be wet but not enough to be able to receive, to withstand penetration without harm. Lubricant saves you.” Many interview participants acknowledged the superiority of water-based lubrication to reduce pain and rectal damage. While most stated a preference for water-based lubricants, some reported using saliva and oil-based household products for sexual lubrication due to convenience and preferences from sexual partners. Some participants noted accessibility issues with water-based lubrication and adverse symptoms associated with saliva and oil-based lubrication. In the last 3 months, 39% (19/49) of participants sometimes urinated after sex, with 53% (26/49) urinating after sex at least most of the time. 91% (43/47) typically urinated within 15 minutes after intercourse. 43 participants urinated to relieve the natural urge, 12 urinated for peace of mind, 10 urinated to decrease their risk of HIV/STI, and 9 urinated due to easy accessibility of bathroom facilities. 74% (37/50) were at least most likely to have regular access to a toilet after sex. 59% (29/49) knew of at least one person who consistently urinated after sex.
 “… they informed me from some training that it was convenient to urinate afterwards because that can help eliminate some -er, let’s say- bacteria or agents that can cause diseases of the urethral canals, right? Oh, and we recommend it. Have I been specifically asked questions about it? I don’t think so. People are not very aware of this topic, and it is rather something that I have to bring up in conversation and tell them: “uh, well, remember that after having sex, as much as possible it would be good for you to urinate, right? no?’, And in that way it helps to eliminate germs, er and to the extent possible even that could occur. Er, so, that’s what I recommend, but it’s not like -according to what I remember right now- they have come to ask me: “hey should I urinate? Or how is this urination?” I don’t know if it’s so well spread or if people know it so much that they don’t ask anymore, right? It’s probably not that widespread.” Although most interview participants performed postcoital urination, some were unsure of this practice and questioned its utility and efficacy. A few participants noted the difference in one’s tendency to urinate after sex, determined if the partner is topping (performing insertive or penetrating sex), one’s hydration status, and if they previously voided. 20% (10/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum may increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 54% (27/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum did not increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 86% (43/50) were in agreement that microscopic tears may increase the chance of contracting HIV, and 8% (4/50) did not know. 82% (41/50) were in agreement that using a lubricant before and during sex didn’t prevent oneself from contracting HIV, and 12% (6/50) did not know. 68% (34/50) were in agreement that water-based lubricant helps prevent condom breakage, and 14% (7/50) did not know. 78% (39/50) were in agreement that Vaseline, oil-based lubricant, body lotion, or cooking oils were not the correct methods of lubrication before or during sexual intercourse. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that showering or washing one’s genitals with soap and water after sex does not prevent a person from contracting HIV, and 16% (8/50) did not know. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that urinating after sex does not prevent oneself from getting HIV, and 18% (9/50) did not know. 76% (38/50) felt it would be at least somewhat easy to stay informed about HIV prevention methods.
 “ do feel that the government should have more authority in working to inform their students through the [school] curriculum, like teachers should speak about this and there should be less power of the family groups to inform because usually the family groups tend to communicate or misinform through a political agenda due to a lack of knowledge of their own, so I prefer that the person who informs them about these important things to people at this age that they need is the government or someone who has studied for 5 years for that” Most interview participants possessed an accurate understanding of basic HIV/STI science, specifically regarding transmission routes, condoms, water-based lubrication, and genital cleansing. However, some participants shared misguided information concerning douching and PrEP The majority (76%, 38/50) had access to a functioning cell phone most of the time, with 92% (45/49) having access to reliable cellular internet at least most of the time. 92% (46/50) used social media at least most of the time during the day. 60% (30/50) of participants sometimes used social media for health-related purposes, with 30% (15/50) of participants using social media for health-related purposes at least most of the time. 49 participants used WhatsApp, 48 used Facebook, 37 used Instagram, 36 used TikTok, and 34 used YouTube. 38 participants used social media for health-related purposes to increase knowledge about diseases, 38 participants to receive updates on advances in healthcare, and 27 participants to exchange tips and ideas on health topics. Participants’ preferences for learning modalities included 31 participants selecting animated videos, 31 selecting virtual educational materials on social media, 28 selecting printed educational materials, 27 selecting a website, and 21 selecting reminders from healthcare personnel.
 Most interview participants recognized the increasing convenience and usability of mobile and social media technologies. However, some acknowledged barriers to mobile technologies, including sharing devices, limitations with rural settings, and acceptability concerns with older, conservative individuals. Some participants shared optimistic perspectives regarding the integration of a hygiene-based intervention in clinical and social settings. Some also noted flyers, brochures, and in-person workshops as potential modalities to increase the awareness of a hygiene-based message. 16% (8/50) of participants were at least in agreement that it frustrates them to think that they will have to use lube before or during sex, wash with soap and water, and urinate after sex. 20% (10/50) were at least in agreement that they would be worried about using these practices because it would harm their health. 86% (43/50) were at least in disagreement with the statement that they would be worried if their healthcare provider found out if they were using a lubricant before/during sex, urinating after sex, and washing their genitals. 84% (42/50) were at least in agreement with the statement that their sexual partners and family would support them if they used these hygiene-based practices, and 76% (38/50) believed their healthcare provider would support them as well. 82% (41/50) of participants were at least in agreement that people in their community would be interested in learning more about hygiene-based practices. 74% (37/50) were at least in agreement that people in their community would consider using lube before or during sex, washing with soap and water, and urinating after sex.
 Most interviewees expressed an interest in learning more about hygiene-based practices. However, many reported barriers to their ability to be well-informed about condom-based and non-condom-based methods for HIV/STI prevention. Some identified the conservative government of Peru, traditional cultural norms, inaccurate HIV/STI resources, lack of LGBTQ+ representation, and substandard values of sensitivity from healthcare providers as the most notable obstacles faced by TW and GBMSM to optimizing one’s sexual and general health.
 “t has to be something constant and always renewable, that is not always the same, that is, not only to make the [trans] girls come for the simple fact that I give them condoms, or in a worship I give them the money, no, but make them come for other things, right? It can also be a space for articulation or union between the girls themselves who can come together and share–what do I know–an afternoon of movies, a talk or a conversation, like we call it a “tea for aunts;” a space where the community can come and -er- at any time they want, not only to receive condoms, lubricants, right? It stays as a community, but it is something that over time, as time goes by, begins to give different -um- prevention in different ways, but for the same community, right?” This study aimed to bring awareness to the commonality of hygiene-based practices and provide a preliminary assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of lubrication, genital cleansing, postcoital urination, and douching. A diverse range of viewpoints and experiences highlighted real-world trends and needs of local TW and GBMSM. Study data indicated the potential acceptability and feasibility of water-based lubrication and postcoital urination and washing, despite some participants questioning and a few sharing misguided information about the safety and efficacy of these practices. All survey and most interview participants voiced usability with douching, despite a majority of survey participants showcasing misinformation about douching’s potential harms. In addition, an impressive number of participants reported sexual uses of alcohol-based cleansers (such as hand wipes and hand sanitizer), oil-based household products and saliva-based lubrication, and douching with chamomile, salt, and vinegar. Given the prevalence of douching and other hygiene-based practices within our sample, we question whether past epidemiological research has underrepresented the commonality of receptive and hygiene-based practices among Peruvian TW and GBMSM or whether these findings are more reflective of sampling bias. Regardless, most participants recognized that local TW and GBMSM have been longing for more accessible and accurate information about douching, lubrication, postcoital urination and washing, and its associated risks, benefits, and safest techniques. A fair number of testimonials emerged during the interviews highlighting sociopolitical hardships to one’s autonomy in the context of HIV/STI risk. As this study was being conducted, most TW and GBMSM did not have the opportunity to start PrEP due to widespread accessibility issues. Even among the minority who were fortunate to have access to effective methods, a few participants were stigmatized during their adherence to PrEP and condoms, expressing that they were perceived as being “unhealthy” or “unholy” by others for simply prioritizing their sexual health. Interestingly, if given the hypothetical opportunity to take PrEP in the future, most wouldn’t anticipate any changes to their current behavioral practices. Nevertheless, some did predict an increased number of sexual partners and decreased use of condoms with hypothetical PrEP use. Furthermore, some bottoms (or partners performing receiving or receptive sex) shared accounts of victimization and manipulation for the sexual, typically risky, desires of dominant, masculine tops. Although there was a diverse spectrum of femininity and masculinity among our sample, these pains were disproportionately against submissive, feminine bottoms. Some have testimonies of being forced to douche, not using condoms or water-based lubricants, abusing poppers (an inhalant used to enhance sex and relax the anal muscles), and hiding HIV/STI pharmaceutical treatment. It’s reassuring that community leaders recognize this power imbalance and actively empower submissive TW and GBMSM; however, much more discussion and action are needed to dissipate this inequality. Regarding preferred learning modalities, multi-media deliverables are a promising area for future research and public health initiatives. Our results are in line with previous findings that show Internet-based technologies as valuable vehicles for optimizing one’s sexual health–validating the importance of low-intensity modalities. Most participants shared positive attitudes towards accurate, health-related content seen on social media. Many also recognized the utility of printed materials, in-person workshops, and other outreach events to increase awareness of a hygiene-based message. Although most participants liked the direction of the project, participants’ perspectives focused on suggestions to improve our message and implementation in the future. Recognizing the conservative nature of Peruvian society, some participants pinpointed outdated ideologies and prejudices as the main driving force for the many vulnerabilities TW and GBMSM face for equitable HIV/STI care and societal attention. Understandably, some skepticism may be present regarding the acceptability of a hygiene-based message and other new HIV/STI resources due to its novelty and the traditional nature of Peru’s culture. We are grateful that our sample shared valuable strategies to overcome these barriers and ensure a collective mission in the fight against HIV/STI. General recommendations focused on ensuring satisfactory LGBTQ + representation and advisement on all future directions of L Overall, interest in these hygiene-based practices was high, and many were curious about the project’s future. These preliminary results add to an under-valued body of literature showcasing the increasing justification of a hygiene-based message for HIV/STI prevention. To our awareness, this is the first study that explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and preferred learning modalities prioritizing TW. Given the exploratory nature of our study, we did not intend to demonstrate statistical significance from our findings. Rather, we sought to identify barriers and facilitators to inform a larger acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy study. Additional work is needed to address the identified barriers and further explore the potential of a hygiene-based message in the prevention of HIV/STI. Unfortunately, our data was vulnerable to considerable bias, and we encountered several limitations in this study. Despite our best efforts, sampling bias likely occurred, decreasing the external validity of our assumptions used to derive real-world trends. Most notably, these included advertising, self-selection, and healthy-user bias. Methodological and statistical limitations were also present, including our small sample size, lack of similar research studies to reference from, the use of self-reported data, cross-cultural and translational drawbacks, and the lack of advanced quantitative analysis techniques. In addition, the investigator team was unable to retrieve particular survey data, likely due to restricted access from a free  There were notable strengths of the study. The mentorship team actively prioritized the core values of the project’s mission and a holistic refinement process using the best available, evidence-based resources and a participatory design process among the research team. Our reliance on diverse organizations and public health centers within different districts of Peru significantly enhanced the depth and variety of perspectives from our sample. The team and our sample were fortunate to have JCA as a vital contributor to the project’s highest standards of transparency, sensitivity, and respect for all involved. All participants received evidence-based HIV/AIDS educational materials, referrals to available HIV-related services, and resources on local community organizations. All interview participants were given condoms and personal water-based lubricants, and provided a safe, private space to discuss sensitive topics of sexual health that are not common in “normal” social settings in Peru. During a post-research event, we additionally shared the study results with past participants, local TW-GBMSM organizations, and community partners. All participants were also provided a PDF copy of all published articles. Lastly, the results from this study may offer indirect benefits to researchers, educators, and key community members with an additional understanding of a variety of common behaviors and attitudes that may impact sexual health and practical approaches to sharing health-related information that may prove critical for the development of important sexual health interventions. This study represents a pivotal step in investigating the role of hygiene-based practices and multi-media deliverables in promoting evidence-based HIV/STI prevention education. Overall, participants found water-based lubrication, and postcoital urination and washing to be potentially acceptable and feasible to adhere to consistently. Most participants also shared significant usability with douching. In addition, mobile messaging modalities for health-related purposes and in-person events were favorably liked among participants.","['Hygiene', 'lubrication', 'cleansing', 'urination', 'douching', 'learning', 'intervention']",2024-9-20,Research Square,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11451521,Chemsex Session Typologies and Associated Sociodemographic Factors in Sexual Minority Men: Latent Class Analysis From a Cultural Perspective Using a Cross-Sectional Survey,"Chemsex prevalence is still not well known, and both the lack of homogeneity and cultural component of chemsex practices are usually overlooked. This study aims to estimate the proportion of sexual minority men (SMM) engaging in chemsex sessions, while understanding the cultural dimension of chemsex, and to analyze distinct session typologies with potential risk differences and the sociodemographic factors associated with engaging in them. A total of 5711 SMM residing throughout Spain participated in an anonymous web-based survey that assessed chemsex session engagement and characteristics, drug use, and sociodemographic variables. We measured the association of sociodemographic factors with engaging in chemsex sessions by calculating adjusted prevalence ratios, using multivariate Poisson regression analysis. Chemsex typologies were analyzed using latent class analysis, and sociodemographic factors were associated with the different risk classes. Our results determined that 21.1% (1205/5711; 95% CI 20.0%‐22.1%) of SMM engaged in chemsex sessions during their lifetime. Participating in sessions was significantly associated with being a migrant, not having a comfortable financial situation, openly living their sexuality, residing in bigger municipalities, older age, using steroids, and living with HIV (adjusted prevalence ratio: range 1.17-2.01; all  Chemsex is relatively common among SMM in Spain, but it is important to differentiate typologies of sessions with varying risks, and the proportion of SMM engaging in high-risk sessions is low. Chemsex is highly associated with sociodemographic factors. Chemsex should be prioritized in public health programs, which should consider the different forms of sessions with their varying risks and prevalence, while also considering the cultural dimension inherent to chemsex.","Over the last two decades, chemsex has become more prevalent within the LGBTQAI+ community, particularly among cis sexual minority men (SMM). Chemsex is typically defined as a specific type of sexualized substance use in the queer community [ This sexual cultural phenomenon has gained significance within public health, as there are risks associated with substance use (including the criminalization of the substances) and certain sexual activities [ The prevalence of chemsex is still not well known. Most studies estimating the percentage of SMM engaging in chemsex have significant limitations, such as including only SMM living with HIV [ Previous articles have found that chemsex is associated with different sociodemographic factors [ Evidence shows that chemsex is not a homogeneous phenomenon, but rather comprises various subcultures and practices, each associated with different risks [ One possible quantitative approach to address this heterogeneity is to identify different session typologies through latent class analysis (LCA), which enables a person-centered approach. LCA has been used to analyze substance use typologies among SMM, often identifying a class with higher consumption of substances related to chemsex and referring to that group as chemsex users [ Thus, our study aims to estimate the prevalence of chemsex in a large and diverse sample, understanding chemsex sessions as a cultural phenomenon rather than just sexualized substance use, and to explore associated sociodemographic factors. Additionally, we seek to analyze distinct session classes with potential risk differences and the sociodemographic factors associated with these typologies. A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from 5711 participants of an open web-based survey on substance use among SMM residing in Spain and aged 16 years or older. Recruitment took place between May and July of 2020. Participants were mostly recruited through advertisements displayed or sent to all users on dating apps commonly used by the SMM community in Spain (Grindr, Scruff, Wapo, Bakala, MachoBB, GROWLr, and Xtudr), or via open invitations by LGBTQAI+ influencers, content creators, and key individuals on social media platforms (using YouTube videos and Instagram stories and posts). Additionally, participants were recruited in collaboration with LGBTQAI+ community organizations that sent invitations to their members and posted advertisements on their social media platforms. The survey was anonymous and featured a self-administered questionnaire, thus reducing social-desirability bias and increasing both diversity and geographic variability within the sample [ The survey was designed and reported in accordance with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) [ The questionnaire asked participants about any previous engagement in chemsex sessions with others, defined as using drugs during sex sessions in order to have specific sexual activities. In addition, it included a set of questions characterizing the sessions: the length of the sessions, the number of people that participants had condomless anal sex with during a session (both receptive and penetrative), intravenous use of substances in this context (slamming), and sexualized use of certain substances particularly related to chemsex and sexualized use (GHB, methamphetamine, mephedrone, ketamine, and poppers). Additionally, the survey included questions regarding a set of sociodemographic variables: their age and migratory status, size of municipality of residence (rural areas with <50,000 inhabitants, medium-size cities with between 50,000 and 500,000 inhabitants, and big cities with >500,000 inhabitants), whether they considered their own financial situation to be comfortable, whether they were openly living their sexuality, whether they were living with HIV, and their lifetime steroid use. The proportion of SMM that had engaged in chemsex sessions was calculated with a 95% CI. In order to estimate the sociodemographic factors associated with engaging in chemsex sessions, a multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance model was used to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios, along with the corresponding 95% CI. Prevalence ratios were adjusted in the regression by all the sociodemographic factors specified in the previous section. We took a person-centered approach to the analysis; LCA was performed to identify and characterize meaningful latent classes or subgroups of participants that engaged in different kinds of chemsex sessions with different risk patterns [ All calculations were performed using Stata (version 17; StataCorp). Statistical significance was set at  All participants gave their informed consent to take part in this research project, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Health Carlos III (CEI-PI35_2020-v3). Privacy and confidentiality were ensured, as the survey was anonymous. No incentives or compensation were offered to participants. The importance of conducting the research from a nonstigmatizing perspective against the SMM and chemsex communities was considered throughout the whole process. Approximately half (3162/5711) of the participants were younger than 40 years. The vast majority of SMM in the sample were born in Spain (4717/5699), were not living with HIV (4041/5711), and had never used steroids (5303/5508). In addition, 43.3% (2369/5470) of participants lived in big cities, one-third (1713/5470) lived in medium-size cities, and one-quarter (1388/5470) lived in rural areas. Approximately two-thirds (3542/5477) of participants had a comfortable financial situation and 54% (3102/5709) openly lived their sexuality ( The proportion of SMM engaging in chemsex sessions was 21.1% (1205/5711 participants; 95% CI 20%‐22.1%). Several sociodemographic factors were significantly associated with engaging in chemsex sessions: being a migrant ( Ref: reference category. A 3-class model was chosen considering a combination of goodness-of-fit statistical criteria ( Chemsex sessions lasting 6 hours or more. With 5 or more people in the same session. GHB: gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Lower-risk sessions (class 1) represented 57.2% of chemsex participants. Fewer participants engaged in long sessions (35.4%) or condomless anal sex in groups (23.1%) compared to the other typologies. All substance use percentages were under 3% except for GHB (4.3%) and poppers (79.5%). There was a very low conditional probability of slamming (1.3%) in this class. Medium-risk sessions (class 2) represented 19.6% of participants that engage in chemsex sessions. This group had a higher conditional probability of engaging in long sessions (63.8%) but a low probability of engaging in condomless anal sex in groups (17.1%). Use of all substances was over 20%, with higher use of mephedrone (43.7%), GHB (83.8%), and poppers (93.2%). This group had a very low probability of slamming (0.7%). Higher-risk sessions (class 3) represented 23.2% of participants that engage in chemsex sessions. This group had a very high conditional probability of engaging in long sessions (95.8%) and condomless anal sex in groups (76.6%). The conditional probability of using all of the listed substances was over 40%, with higher use of mephedrone (78.5%), GHB (80.2%), and poppers (93.9%). This group had a slamming prevalence of 39.2%. First, we compared class 2 (medium-risk group) to class 1 (lower-risk group). For class 2, older participants had a lower probability of membership than participants aged 16‐29 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.31‐0.95) compared to membership in class 1. Probability of membership in class 2 was also lower among SMM with unknown HIV status compared to those that know they do not live with HIV (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17‐0.92), and was higher among SMM that openly live their sexuality compared to those who do not (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.01‐2.42), relative to membership in class 1. The differences between the remaining sociodemographic variables were not statistically significant when comparing lower-risk and medium-risk classes (all  Next, we compared class 3 (higher-risk group) to class 1 (lower-risk group). The probability of membership in class 3 relative to membership in class 1 was lower for SMM aged over 40 years compared to those aged under 30 years (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33‐0.93). It was higher for participants living in bigger municipalities (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.51‐5.02), using steroids (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.57‐4.9), openly living their sexuality (OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.78‐4.43), and living with HIV (OR 4.99, 95% CI 3.20‐7.79). Migratory status and financial situation ( Ref: reference category. The proportion of SMM that participated in chemsex sessions during their lifetime as reported in this study falls at the lower end of the range (17%-33%) reported by the vast majority of previously published papers [ The LCA revealed that there are different typologies of chemsex participants, with distinct prevalence and behaviors that entail varying levels of risk, as qualitative evidence had previously indicated [ In our study, more than half of chemsex participants engaged in short sessions, characterized by infrequent condomless anal sex with multiple partners, low consumption of high-risk substances, and minimal slamming. Consequently, this group has a lower likelihood of engaging in problematic chemsex and experiencing associated negative consequences. The large proportion of SMM participating in chemsex sessions without using GHB, mephedrone, methamphetamine, or ketamine underscores the limitations of defining chemsex solely based on the consumption of these substances, rather than considering it as a cultural phenomenon within a community. Approximately one-fifth of SMM engaging in chemsex participated in longer sessions with high GHB consumption, but where condomless anal sex with many partners remained infrequent, and slamming was almost anecdotal. Therefore, there is a group of chemsex participants that would benefit primarily from risk reduction strategies related to GHB use (eg, drug testing, starting with low doses and waiting before increasing, not mixing with other depressant drugs, recognizing and responding to signs of overdose, considering interactions with HIV medication). Finally, about one-quarter of SMM in the chemsex community—and about 5% of all surveyed SMM—engaged in longer sessions with very high risks due to condomless anal sex with many partners, the substances used, and a high proportion of participants engaging in slamming. This is the group where health promotion and risk reduction strategies would be most effective, as problematic chemsex and negative health consequences are more likely to occur. Chemsex participation varied across sociodemographic groups of SMM in our study, which should be considered when developing public health policies. As previous studies had found, the proportion of SMM who had engaged in chemsex was higher among older men [ Some previous studies have reported an increased probability of engaging in chemsex among migrant SMM [ To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have conducted a multivariable analysis to examine the relationship between anabolic steroid use and chemsex. In our study, we identified a higher probability of engaging in chemsex among SMM who use steroids. This association has been observed previously in other drug use contexts [ The same sociodemographic factors associated with engaging in chemsex among SMM are also linked to participating in higher-risk sessions compared to lower-risk sessions, with the exception of financial situation and age. Older SMM were more likely to have engaged in chemsex but less likely to participate in higher-risk sessions. Notably, living with HIV was particularly associated with engaging in those high-risk sessions, which could be explained by prevalent behaviors in those sessions that increase the risk of HIV infection, even though the vast majority of SMM living with HIV in Spain have an undetectable and therefore untransmittable viral load [ This study is subject to certain limitations. A nonprobabilistic sampling method was used, which may have resulted in some bias, as participants were SMM present on dating apps or active on social networks and following LGBTQAI+ influencers or activist community organizations. This could limit the generalizability and external validity of the results, which may differ in other countries. However, it is worth noting that, despite the sensitivity of the topic, different recruitment settings were used to decrease bias and increase generalizability. The web-based sampling approach allowed for a much larger sample of SMM and increased geographic variability and diversity [ On the other hand, this study also possesses important strengths. First, it included one of the largest SMM samples to date. Our web-based sampling method allowed for a richer representation of the community than samplings in sexually transmitted infection clinics or those that only included SMM living with or without HIV. Additionally, we studied chemsex while considering it as a cultural phenomenon and not merely the sexualized use of certain substances. Understanding the cultural dimension of chemsex is fundamental to advancing research and policies that are useful for the SMM community. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study that explores different forms of chemsex sessions and their varying health potential risks using LCA. Chemsex is relatively common among SMM in Spain. Nevertheless, despite the tendency to view chemsex as a uniform phenomenon, there are different typologies of sessions, and the proportion of SMM engaging in high-risk sessions is low. Consequently, chemsex should become a public health priority, and health institutions should reinforce their chemsex-related health promotion programs using a nonstigmatizing approach. However, the fact that there are different forms of sessions with varying risks and prevalence has to be considered by those programs. Additionally, chemsex is highly related to sociodemographic factors. It is noteworthy that the sociodemographic factors associated with participation in chemsex may not necessarily align with those associated with engaging in higher-risk sessions. This information should be duly considered in chemsex policies and strategies. The association between chemsex and some sociodemographic factors further underscores the cultural dimension inherent in chemsex, which should be considered in both comprehensive research and health promotion programs.","['chemsex', 'sexualized drug use', 'sexual minority men', 'typologies', 'latent class analysis', 'social determinants of health', 'culture', 'party and play', 'sociodemographics', 'sexual minority', 'cross-sectional study', 'homogeneity', 'SMM', 'Spain', 'drug use', 'Poisson regression', 'migrants', 'public health', 'LGBTQ', 'teenagers', 'adults', 'HIV', 'sexual health', 'sexual risk behavior', 'gay']",2024-9-27,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11449029,"Changes in the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota in pediatric patients
with adenotonsillar hypertrophy","The present study aimed to investigate the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota
composition in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy (AH) and assess
longitudinal alterations in both microbiota after a probiotic oral spray
treatment. A cohort of 57 AH patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to
the probiotic and placebo groups for a 5-month treatment course. Pharyngeal
and nasal swabs were collected before and after treatment and analyzed by
16S rRNA-based metataxonomics and axenic cultures for pathobiont
identification. 16S rRNA sequences from pharyngeal and nasal swabs of 65
healthy children (HC) were used as microbiota reference profiles. We found
that the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota of AH children were similar. When
compared to HC, we observed an increase of the genera
 Adenotonsillar hypertrophy (AH) is considered the main cause of breathing
disorders during sleep in children. AH patients, after significant morbidity
and often multiple courses of antibiotics, often proceed to tonsillectomy
and/or adenoidectomy. Given the potential risks associated with these
procedures, there is a growing interest in the use of nonsurgical adjuvant
therapies, such as probiotics, that could potentially reduce their need for
surgical intervention. In this study, we investigated the pharyngeal and
nasal microbiota in patients with AH compared with healthy children.
Furthermore, we tested the effects of probiotic spray administration on both
disease symptoms and microbiota profiles, to evaluate the possible use of
this microbial therapy as an adjuvant for AH patients.","Adenotonsillar hypertrophy (AH) is considered the main cause of breathing disorders
during sleep in children, ranging from snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,
which, in turn, can cause cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, behavioral
disorders, and learning delays ( To address this need, we characterized the adenotonsillar microbiota in patients
affected by AH compared to healthy children (HC), to see whether, indeed, AH is
associated with alterations in the upper respiratory microbial environment.
Moreover, we evaluated the effects of an oral spray probiotic, both on the clinical
manifestations of this disease and on adenotonsillar microbial ecology. This study was made up of two parts. The first part was a cross-sectional study,
which compared the profiles of the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota in AH
children and HC. The second part was a longitudinal study, which investigated
the effects of the administration of an oral spray probiotic on AH clinical
symptoms and pharyngeal and nasal microbiota composition ( Study workflow. Children affected by grade II–IV AH with inflammation, in consultation for
tonsillectomy, were enrolled at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the
Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital, IRCCS, at Rome, Italy, between
March 2019 and February 2021. The inclusion criteria were grade II–IV AH
with inflammation with persisting symptoms for at least 1 year, ages 3–8
years, and enrolment in the surgical wait list for tonsillectomy for recurrent
inflammation ( Adenoid hypertrophy was graded according to Parikh’s classification based
on the anatomical relationships between the adenoid tissue and the surrounding
structures: vomer, soft palate, and torus tubarius. Grade 1 adenoids are
nonobstructive and do not contact any of the previously mentioned anatomic
subsites, while grade 2, 3, and 4 adenoids contact the torus tubarius, vomer,
and soft palate, respectively ( After baseline examination, the patients were randomly (1:1) treated with
probiotic oral spray (ORO) or hypertonic oral spray (PLB). The probiotic spray
consisted of a minimum of 125 × 10 Each patient underwent three clinical evaluations by an otorhinolaryngology
specialist: visit 1, a month after randomization; visit 2, after 3 months of
randomization; and, finally, visit 3, after 5 months of treatment. During each
visit, the following parameters were evaluated and recorded: complete physical
examination, body temperature, signs of chronic or acute adenotonsillar
inflammation, drug consumption, and adverse events. Two hundred twenty-eight biological samples were collected from patients at

total of 18,629 ASVs, grouped in 20 phyla and 270 bacterial families (Table
S1). First, we evaluated the influence of seasonality on the microbiota composition of
the nose and pharynx. We confirmed that seasonality did not have a significant
effect on the bacterial composition of the nasal microbiota, while it did affect
the pharyngeal one (Table S2). We then identified which microbes were affected
by the seasons in the pharynx, including  To describe the differences between the pharyngeal and nasal microbial
communities, we measured ecological parameters based on α-diversity

by differential network analysis, which evidenced a lower number of edges in the

probiotic treatment, there was a significant increase of rare bacteria (Chao-1
index) in both the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota ( Probiotic effects on pharyngeal and nasal microbiota. Alpha-diversity box
plots of pharyngeal ( Next, we investigated the effects of probiotic treatment on the ecological
composition of the bacterial populations in the pharynx and nasal passages. The
analysis of the relative abundance of pharyngeal microbiota in the ORO group
revealed an increase of  To see whether these taxonomical shifts could also translate into changes in
functional interactions between the microbiota and the host, we applied the
PICRUSt algorithm to pharyngeal and nasal microbial populations before and after
treatment. In the pharynx, we observed a marked decrease in signaling and

AH compared with healthy children. Furthermore, we tested the effects of probiotic
spray administration on disease symptoms and both microbiota profiles, to evaluate
the possible use of this microbial therapy as an adjuvant therapy for AH
patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study that used this multiple exploratory
approach, comparing two different microbial ecological niches and evaluating the
microbial changes before and after oral probiotic treatment in children. Recently, a meta-analysis reported that probiotics were more effective than the
placebo in suppressing URTI, resulting in a reduced need for antibiotics, in both
adults and children suffering from URTIs ( However, comparative evaluations of different probiotic formulations have shown that
not all have the same biological activity but that each has specific peculiarities
in terms of mechanism of action and efficacy ( Our results suggest that the probiotic spray reduced the number of URTIs during the
study period, consistent with other studies on respiratory infections in children
( Generally, under physiological conditions in the upper respiratory tract, bacterial
richness and evenness vary dramatically between niches, with the highest richness
and evenness observed in the oropharynx and oral cavity ( Mechanistically, increased tissue inflammation in AH may change the physiological
conditions of the nasal and pharyngeal ecological niches, thus favoring the
overgrowth of certain bacterial genera or species. Indeed, despite the reported
differences between the two, the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota of AH patients did
share some microbial markers. This overlap in bacterial taxa could be explained by
the proximity of the body sites and also the common source of drainage,
i.e Interestingly, among the differentially expressed taxa pre- and post-probiotic
administration, we observed a reduction of  Moreover, we found bacteria that inhabited both body sites and whose presence was not
influenced by probiotic administration, such as  However, our results revealed that the effects of probiotics were more evident on the
functional characteristics of the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota. Interestingly, in
the pharyngeal microbiota, we observed a marked reduction of the multicomponent
Na In the placebo group, we found an increase in pathways involved in stress resistance,
which prevents microorganisms from the toxic effects of Ni Finally, we evaluated whether probiotics could affect the growth of pathobionts
selected among those attributable to the pathogenesis of AH. In fact, the upper
airway microbiota is composed of opportunistic pathogens, which traverse the
commensal–pathogen continuum ( Moreover, the probiotic seemed to reduce the number of colonies of  Although our results are novel and promising, this study has some limitations. First,
the sample size was limited by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a restriction in
subject enrolment. A larger cohort could have helped to overcome possible
confounding effects, even if minimal, due to the influence of seasonality on the
upper airway microbiota. Secondly, even though the microbiota profiling of the
lymphoid tissue itself or the tonsillar crypts could be more informative, we carried
out nose and pharynx swab sampling, to provide a less invasive sampling option in
such young children and the absence of sedation. In conclusion, this study offers a
comprehensive overview of the pharyngeal and nasal microbiota associated with health
and AH, increasing the knowledge of the complex host–bacteria relationships
in these specific and important body sites. Moreover, our results show that the
probiotic had no clear adverse effects on the health of AH patients, conferred
partial protection against URTIs, and reduced the presence of the pathobiont

11447694,Challenges experienced by nurses in implementing Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services in clinics of the Limpopo province,"Effective implementation of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services (AYFS) that are accessible, acceptable and effective for diverse youth population groups is significant to enhancing youth health. Because of various factors, improving youth health is a challenge in clinics in rural areas. This study aims to explore and understand the challenges nurses experience while implementing AYFS programmes in Kganya local area clinics of the Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. The study was conducted in the clinics of Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. A qualitative, phenomenological, exploratory, descriptive design is employed in this study. Twelve nurses were selected using purposive sampling. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with an interview guide. Notably, data were analysed using Tesch’s open coding method. Two themes emerge from this study: ‘Challenges experienced related to the implementation of Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services’ and ‘Suggestions to improve Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services’. The results of this study confirm that nurses experience diverse challenges while implementing AYFS. Challenges include a lack of trained staff and material resources and the negative attitudes of adolescents, parents and community members. This study’s findings might help identify the gaps in implementing the AYFS programmes. The findings may assist policymakers and the National Department of Health (NDoH) to monitor and review the effectiveness of the AYFS programme standards.","Adolescence and young adulthood are stages of rapid physical and psychosocial change and development and require proper management. These stages are characterised by less parental control and increased influence of peers and social media. Furthermore, these stages are often associated with a rise in experimentation and exploration, a search for identity and an increase in risky behaviour, alcohol and substance abuse, possible sexual and reproductive health problems, violence and mental illness (Cooper, De Lannoy & Rule  Worldwide, 80% of 1.2 billion adolescents live in developing countries with inadequate access to health services such as sexual and reproductive health care (Beksinska et al.  Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO 2015) aimed to assist policymakers and health service planners improve the quality of health care services through the formation of global health standards. Furthermore, the WHO intended to ensure that adolescents obtain the health services needed to promote, protect and improve their health and well-being. Sweden is one of the few countries that has integrated AYFS into the public health system; this is well sustained to meet young people’s needs (Thomée et al.  In South Africa, the National Adolescent Friendly Clinic Initiative (NAFCI) programme was conceptualised and implemented by the Reproductive Health Research Unit (RHRU) between 1999 and 2005 (WHO  Through her experience as a practice nurse, the primary author learned and observed that nurses encounter various challenges when implementing AYFS programmes in clinics. These obstacles are caused by a range of factors like inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of staff and inadequate training and equipment. The primary author’s observations are supported by monthly clinic peer reviews and the ideal clinic assessment, which highlights the non-performance and difficulties faced by nurses in the Kganya local area when implementing the AYFS programme. The South African AYFS initiative is one of the few projects that has been scaled to a national level (Geary et al. 2015). The availability of AYFS in health care facilities is crucial to support the well-being and stability of adolescents and youth. Despite the various health challenges faced in South Africa, AYFS remains committed to implementing a standards-based approach to improve the quality of care provided to adolescents and youth (WHO  This study aims to understand the challenges nurses experience in implementing AYFS in clinics of the Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. This study aims: To explore and describe the challenges nurses experience when implementing AYFS in clinics of the Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. To provide recommendations for the nurses to facilitate the implementation of AYFS programme in clinics of the Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. This study employs a qualitative, phenomenological, exploratory, descriptive design to understand the challenges nurses experience when implementing the AYFS programme in clinics of the Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. In addition, the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies checklist was used to guarantee that every essential aspect of this qualitative manuscript was precisely incorporated (Tong, Sainsbury & Craig  A non-probability purposive sampling method was used in this study. At the time of the study, the population included 41 nurses working in accredited facilities to provide AYFS (Polit & Beck  This study was conducted in the clinics of the Kganya local area of the Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. The Capricorn district is one of the five districts of the Limpopo province. The Kganya local area has six fixed clinics and one mobile clinic. The area serves communities from Mankweng, Ga-Mamabolo, Ga-Molepo and Ga-Mothapo. The clinics include J Mamabolo, Sehlale, Molepo, Mamotshwa, Phuti and E Lekganyane. Data were collected through one-on-one, semi-structured, in-depth interviews between January and March 2021, in line with Kvale and Brinkman’s seven stages of qualitative interview investigations (Kvale & Brinkman  Interviews were conducted in private cubicles free from distractions and lasted between 35 and 60 min. All 16 trained AYFS nurses were recruited and expressed their willingness to participate in the study. However, the data collection process was concluded after interviewing the 12th participant, as data saturation had been reached. The interview guide was piloted on three nurses before the interviews; these nurses were excluded from the main study. With the participants’ written and verbal consent, the first author conducted the interviews and used a digital voice recorder to record them; field notes were also taken. Data were analysed using Tesch’s open-coding method of data analysis as described by Creswell and Creswell ( Every audio-recorded interview was transcribed verbatim. The principal author made sense of the data by examining each verbatim transcript several times. Her understanding of the significance of the data segments was enhanced during this process. She read and assimilated the transcripts and noted the authors’ ideas. The independent coder received the transcribed data and used the same data analysis procedure used by the researchers. The author then took the collected data and condensed it into codes by analysing the frequency of concepts used in the verbatim transcriptions. She then identified similar topics that emerged during the data reduction process and grouped them together while clustering those without a clear association separately. The author questioned herself about the interview transcriptions, using the frequency-based codes of the concepts. Questions included ‘What is this about?’ and ‘What is the underlying meaning?’ The author grasped the meaning of the data and this led to coding. Codes were assigned to the topics that the author abbreviated, and these codes were marked besides the corresponding parts of the transcription. All these codes were written in the margins of the transcripts. Themes and categories were developed by the researcher using the coded data and associated texts. The list was then reduced by grouping related topics together to give meaning to the themes and categories. The author verified that there was no repetition in the work. There was no necessity to refine the codes, topics and themes. All data of each theme were compiled into a single column. The authors carried out an initial analysis and then had a discussion with the independent coder to reconcile the themes and categories identified independently by everyone. A further meeting with an independent coder was held to establish a consensus on the themes and categories. There was no need for recoding. This study utilised Guba and Lincoln’s ( The researcher obtained ethical clearance from the University of Limpopo, Turfloop Ethics Research Committee (TREC/147/2020/PG). The Department of Health in Limpopo province also granted permission to conduct research in specific clinics. Furthermore, the operational managers of the clinic in Kganya local area of the Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa, granted permission for the study. Participants were given written and verbal explanations of the study’s purpose and objectives before data collection. Participants were informed that interviews would be audio recorded, and field notes would be taken. Participants willingly participated in this study, having signed an informed consent form. They were informed that they could withdraw from participating in the study at any point without any penalty. Interviews were conducted in a private consulting room to ensure the participants’ privacy. Anonymity and confidentiality were ensured by assigning each participant a pseudonym (Participants 1, 2, 3, etc.) to ensure that no information obtained during the study would be linked to the participants. The study was conducted during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and protocols were adhered to by both the primary author and the participants.

During interviews, participants in this study were able to describe their views on challenges they experienced during the implementation of AYFS. Eight categories emerged from the challenges nurses experience when implementing AYFS in the clinics of Kganya local area, Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. The categories are discussed in the following sections. Signs displaying the time slots for the AYFS programme were posted on notice boards in various clinics of the Kganya local area of Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. It is important to note that AYFS was dedicated to the hours between 14:00 and 17:00, Monday to Friday. Although the youth knew of the scheduled times for AYFS, the study found that they did not follow the programme’s expected schedule. The following extracts from participants confirm this: ‘The only high school we manage to serve is nearby. I render Youth Friendly Service, especially to the school children in the afternoon, but unfortunately, I have challenges with the youth from far away villages since they come late, and the Youth Friendly Service is rendered from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and this prevents us from giving them full service.’ (Participant 1) ‘Their privacy is maintained since they are assisted privately when they seek health services. Again, youth have specific time service as priority, 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. in the clinic. The challenge sometimes comes when youth decide to come during school hours for reproductive health services and HIV counselling and testing, and when we advise that they can still do that after school, they accuse nurses of a negative attitude.’ (Participant 6) Commitment is presented as one of the energising forces for motivation and behaviour. In this study, it emerged that nurses’ commitment was essential in implementing and sustaining the AYFS programme. The following statements from participants support this statement: ‘When I say new young nurses should be invested in the programme, we should also consider an employee’s interest. Otherwise, it is a problem since then no one likes the problem except that it is just a must-do.’ (Participant 6) ‘To make matters worse even my colleagues don’t give me any support instead, when they are seeing patients, and I am busy with the queue, they usually complain that I don’t assist them, but when I am off or on leaving, the youth programme activities to stop since there will be no guider. They only assist those seeking medical attention.’ (Participant 10) Participants indicate that there is a scarcity of trained nurses to implement the AYFS programme in the clinics of Kganya local area. This is evident from the following extracts: ‘I think is because of the lack of training. For example, only one nurse in this clinic is trained in Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services. We only implemented the programme according to the policies years ago. Two enrolled assistant nurses were working on the programme, but only one was trained formally, but she has since passed on, and since then, the youth friendly service programme has been on and off.’ (Participant 4) ‘Lack of training of personnel is a problem because we’re only two trained nurses and I feel that we were not well equipped with the skills and knowledge except that we just love the programme and are committed to our work and that we cannot refuse if my managers give us task but it is overwhelming.’ (Participant 7) This study reveals that a lack of resources is experienced as a major challenge in implementing AYFS. The resources range from human to organisational and materials, as confirmed by the following extracts: ‘The other challenge we face is the lack of educational materials, for example pamphlets, because when the programme was still under love life, pamphlets magazines were available and very helpful to the youth, but there is nothing except mouth-to-ear education.’ (Participant 3) ‘The last challenge I can remember is that the space specifically created for youth services is too small, and there is a shortage of personnel. In my view, if I am responsible for youth, I should specifically be concentrating on the youth. Because in some instances, you will find that I am also called or responsible for doing the other nursing activities at the time for youth service. This has a bad impact since something might happen the minute you are gone.’ (Participant 11) ‘The other challenge is that we lack enough resources for the smooth running of the programme. We don’t have a music system, or a television set which will help the youth will be able to watch educational dramas. Another important challenge we lack is a dedicated space for the youth due to poor structure. These resources I have mentioned make the environment to be conducive to the youth.’ (Participant 9) If adolescent-related health services are not youth friendly, young people will not use them. Poor relationships between youth and nurses make AYFS programmes difficult for youth to access. The following quotations show what the participants said: ‘Some youth just cannot talk with other people maybe it’s how they were raised. They just adopt how they talk with people at home and talk with nurses that way. As for nurses, the youth believe that the nurses have a negative attitude.’ (Participant 2) ‘That is true, to make matters worse other nurses also have a negative attitude towards attending youth or this programme in general. Do nurses make mistakes by judging youth when they consult with sexually transmitted infections or come for family planning services for example, you will hear a nurse asking a teenager: have you started having sex at this age. This negative attitude makes youth fear coming for a consultation, especially when the problem is sexually related.’ (Participant 4) The participants in this study shared similar views on the lack of funding for the AYFS programme as a challenge for AYFS uptake. The importance of funding is mainly for the provision of resources. The following participants’ statement confirms this assertion: ‘The other challenge I see is that funding might be a challenge from the top-level since programme like HIV is getting funding from FPD and ANOVA originally from America or USAID COMPANY. I think youth is the future of this country, the government should consider requesting funding from other private organisations.’ (Participant 2) ‘ANOVA since it is a supporting partner should spread their wings and support other programmes such as AYFS and not only focus on HIV and AIDS because even youth are suffering from HIV and AIDS.’ (Participant 7) The findings of this study reveal that monitoring and evaluation could improve the quality of health provision of the AYFS. This is reflected in the following extracts: ‘The only people who ask if the programme is functional are the sub-district local area managers during ideal clinic assessment, and I also suspect that it is not because they care, but it is the ideal clinic checklist that is requesting the information.’ (Participant 8) ‘Nobody is reviewing or monitoring and evaluating the programme in question. In some instances, youth programme managers even teach the facility to manage what the programme is all about.’ (Participant 6) ‘The only guidance I have is the policy guideline of 2007 for Adolescent Youth-Friendly Service for South Africa. The worst part is that there is no monitoring and evaluation since I manage the programme since 2016.’ (Participant 7) The study findings indicate negative attitudes from different groups: the community, professionals and youth. Here are some of the extracts: ‘Sometimes the youth themselves just have a negative attitude towards the health service rendered in the clinic. They have a negative attitude toward just coming to do activities that do not reward them, unlike when they play snooker or cards, they sometimes have hopes of making money. Sometimes youth just succumb to peer pressure if their peers say the programme or youth-friendly activities are boring, they just follow without their mind.’ (Participant 7) ‘The community at large also has a negative attitude towards this programme since they feel it disturbs their children is education since the schedule for activities is between 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. which was considering that the school will be out by then. But now every parent is focused on their children’s education as it predicts the future, not some activities which they view as a form of the game which they don’t value that child’s education.’ (Participant 5) The results of this study indicate that despite the challenges nurses experience in implementing AYFS, most of these challenges could be overcome. Below are six categories that offer insight into how the implementation of AYFS programmes in clinics could be enhanced. Participants in this study report that an AYFS focal nurse could be appointed to ensure that the implementation of the programme is successful and that continuous training of nurses should be implemented. The following extracts support this: ‘We need a trained or appointed focal person. It is challenging because the government expects us to do the job but does not train us. We are just given policies to follow but don’t know the practical part of it.’ (Participant 3) ‘It’s important to appoint and train young nurses for the AYFS programme. Additionally, management should support these nurses by engaging with them at the grassroots level. At least two more staff members per facility should be trained to support the focal person.’ (Participant 11) The findings of this study suggest that more nurses should receive training to improve their skills in implementing the AYFS programme: ‘At least two more staff members per facility should be trained to give support to the focal person. Included in the two people, it must be the operational managers. I don’t see the reason why the manager can manage people or supervise what she doesn’t know.’ (Participant 4) ‘The training should be done, and each facility should have at least two or more people trained on the programme to assist each other. This should be done because the trained people’s age be taken into consideration. There should also be an initiative for Adolescent Youth Friendly Programme.’ (Participant 6) ‘I recommend that at least managers be trained on the adolescent youth programme so they can be able to support us. At least two people per facility should be trained on AYFS and should be less than 35 years of age so he can cope with the demand of the youth activities.’ (Participant 11) Based on the study findings, the participants felt that the AYFS did not work because the building structure was too small to have a designated room for rendering health services to adolescents and youth. The below extracts from participants confirm this: ‘Every clinic should also have a designated room which is specifically for youth activities.’ (Participant 3) ‘The Department of Health should just go away with the small houses they call clinics.’ (Participant 7) ‘The Department should include the AYFS programme in its budget so that it can be supplied with the necessary resources. The clinic’s structures should be improved, or containers are purchased so that the youth can perform or seek health service privately without mixing with other people.’ (Participant 9) Participants in this study recommend an adequate supply of material resources like educational posters and equipment for effective implementation of the programme as seen in the following extracts: ‘Department of Health should supply us with enough equipment such as music systems and posters.’ (Participant 2) ‘I recommend that every clinic be supplied with IEC [ ‘I think, like the manager of the clinic, she needs to shout in case of shortages of learning materials or other resources since she is well connected to the people up there …’ (Participant 10) The participants suggest starting awareness campaigns and health education efforts to inform the community about the AYFS programme and its importance in providing health care services to adolescents and youth by either having promotion material and pamphlets or awareness campaigns with health education sessions: ‘I recommend that every clinic be supplied with IEC [ ‘The community should be given health talk about the importance of Adolescent Youth Friendly Services. The clinic structure should also be improved, or a specific area be created for the youth.’ (Participant 5) ‘The community should just take part in building the youth and nurses can promote this by educating adults by setting good parental example.’ (Participant 7) The study participants emphasise the importance of funding for AYFS and recommend seeking support from non-profit organisations. Here is what two of the participants shared: ‘I think clinics should be supported by these NGOs so that implementation of Youth Friendly Services Programmes is fast-tracked.’ (Participant 3) ‘I suggest that the same effort given to other programmes such as ante-natal is given to youth-friendly services. Also, NGO involvement should be seen through financial support.’ (Participant 10) The AYFS is an integral programme crafted to draw in and cater for the health requirements of adolescents conveniently and promptly. Furthermore, it is instrumental in retaining young customers for continued sexual and reproductive health services (Vukapi  The first theme that emerged relates to the challenges experienced during the implementation of AYFS. According to the participants in this study, young people have difficulty adhering to the AYFS time schedules in the clinics of Kganya local area. The distance to the clinics also emerged as a challenge. Ninsiima, Chiumia and Ndejjo ( In addition, the lack of commitment of nurses to offer AYFS emerged as a challenge. In line with the current study findings, the study of Awang et al. ( A lack of infrastructure and material resources emerged as another challenge to proper AYFS implementation. In South Africa, the Ideal Clinic initiative was implemented to ensure that clinics had high-quality infrastructure and resources (NDoH  A lack of financial support is another challenge to successfully implementing the AYFS programme. According to the participants in this study, ANOVA and other private organisations should spread their financial wings and support the implementation of the AYFS programme. A study conducted in the Northeastern Peninsular of Malaysia supports the findings of this research, emphasising the importance of financial assistance to ensure the successful implementation of adolescent-friendly health services (Awang et al.  In addition to the challenges experienced by nurses in implementing the AYFS programme in the clinics of Kganya local area, a lack of monitoring and evaluation emerged as a negative factor. According to the participants, operational managers in clinics do not review or monitor how functional the AYFS is. For example, participants report that when the AYFS focal nurses are off duty, no one is delegated to substitute for them. Also, participants report that the functionality of the AYFS programme is only evaluated during Ideal Clinic Assessments by the local area and sub-district managers of Kganya. This is because a fully operational AYFS programme in each clinic is a crucial prerequisite for achieving the status of an Ideal Clinic, as highlighted in Element 44 of the Ideal Clinic Checklist (Ideal Clinic Manual 2020). As other studies have also pointed out, a lack of manager support and inadequate programme evaluation and monitoring hinders the effective implementation of the AYFS programme (Koon, Norris & Goudge  The AYFS programme has been vigorously promoted by the NDoH and partners in South Africa to guarantee that the health and well-being of young people aged between 10 and 24 years receive uniform health care standards. Notably, the AYFS programme, as outlined in the 2017 National Adolescent & Youth Health Policy, is a comprehensive and integrated approach aimed at achieving multiple objectives. These objectives include providing sexual, reproductive and ante-natal health services, preventing HIV and AIDS and TB, introducing innovative youth-oriented programmes and technologies and preventing violence and substance abuse (Pillay, Manderson & Mkhwanazi  On the other hand, the community also has a negative view of the programme, as they believe it disrupts their children’s education. The findings of this study are supported by a systematic review examining factors affecting adolescent and youth access to, and use of, sexual and reproductive health services in sub-Saharan Africa. The review found that barriers include individual barriers, structural barriers, cultural barriers and socio-economic barriers (Ninsiima et al.  Nurses participating in this study suggest measures and practices that may be used to improve the implementation of the AYFS in the clinics of Kganya local area, Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. They suggest that a trained focal nurse for AYFS should be appointed. The findings of this study match those of the study conducted by Vukapi ( In addition to the above suggestion, every clinic should also have a designated room, which is specifically for offering AYFS. Literature corroborates the findings of this study; inadequate or substandard infrastructure in the Limpopo province remains a challenge. For example, in Limpopo, a study by Netshisaulu, Malelelo-Ndou and Ramathuba ( Moreover, participants in this study suggest the provision of an adequate supply of material resources, including information, education and communication materials and music systems, for the smooth implementation and running of the AYFS programme in the Kganya local area clinics. This study’s findings are corroborated by a study conducted in Uganda, which suggests that the Ministry of Health provides adequate equipment and supplies at health facilities to meet the health needs of adolescents and youth (Bukenya et al.  The study was conducted in the clinics of Kganya local area, Capricorn district, Limpopo province, South Africa. However, the findings of this study cannot be generalised to other local areas or districts in this province. Nonetheless, describing the setting and findings in detail may allow other researchers to apply the findings to other settings. The results of this study confirm that nurses experience many challenges while implementing AYFS. Some of the noted challenges include a lack of trained staff, unavailability of materials and resources and small spaces in the clinics to provide AYFS in private. Nurses are also concerned about the negative attitudes of adolescents and youth, their parents and the community towards the AYFS programme. The study recommends that at least two nurses per facility be trained to support the focal person in implementing the AYFS. The study further recommends establishing a well-equipped infrastructure dedicated to AYFS. Additional research is recommended to identify activities that would be useful to AYFS programmes and to develop strategies to improve the implementation of AYFS.","['adolescent', 'Youth Friendly Services', 'challenges', 'nurses', 'implementation']",2024-9-26,Health SA Gesondheid,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11447604,Condomless anal intercourse among HIV-positive and HIV-negative men who have sex with men in Zimbabwe,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where condomless anal intercourse (CAI) is a major driver of HIV transmission among this hidden subpopulation. To determine CAI drivers and prevalence among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM. Data from 1538 MSM who participated in a biobehavioural survey in Zimbabwe were used. Secondary statistical data analysis methods were used to determine prevalences and drivers of CAI. A high prevalence of CAI, of at least 30%, among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM was found. Factors that led to a statistically significant higher CAI among HIV-positives compared to HIV-negatives included drunkenness (35% vs. 25%,  Our findings indicate that economic, socio-behavioural and perceptual dimensions increase men’s likelihood to engage in risky sexual behaviour, suggesting the need for HIV prevention efforts that provide tailored education regarding HIV risk among MSM in SSA. This is the first large biobehavioural survey that generated valuable information useful for analysing condomless anal sex among MSM in Zimbabwe.","The global HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) continues to be a significant public health concern worldwide, given the disproportionate burden of infection this group faces. The primary drivers of CAI can be grouped into socio-behavioural, accessibility, and perceptual dimensions. Socio-behavioural drivers of CAI were perhaps the most multifaceted. Alcohol use, for example, which can impair judgement and decision-making, emerged as a significant factor. The influence of peer pressure or social norms, often leading to unpreparedness or embarrassment regarding procurement of condoms, is another crucial socio-behavioural factor. Furthermore, perceptions related to trust, where regular or attractive partners were less likely to use condoms, indicate that relationship dynamics also play a role in determining condom use. MSM might decide not to use condoms when having sex with a regular sexual partner due to the mutual trust that friends would not put them at risk. If the epidemic within the MSM population is not addressed, efforts to control HIV could be jeopardised, since the epidemic can spread to the entire population through the heterosexual practices of these men. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the prevalence of CAI and its associated risk factors in diverse samples of MSM in a SSA context. As CAI is an essential modifiable proximal determinant of HIV transmission, a better understanding of factors associated with CAI can inform interventions to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission among this hidden high-risk subpopulation. Between March 2019 and July 2019, ICAP at Columbia University, in collaboration with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Zimbabwe, conducted a cross-sectional BBS with MSM and transgender women/gender queer (TGW/GQ) individuals in Harare and Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The survey was conducted using the World Health Organization’s BBS Guidelines for Populations at Risk for HIV, The study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe, Columbia University Institutional Review board and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Associate Director of Science. MRCZ/A/2156. Potential participants were invited to attend an initial visit at the survey offices, during which survey staff verified coupons and screened potential participants for eligibility. If eligible and interested, survey staff obtained written informed consent from each participant in either English, Shona, or Ndebele based on participant preference. A total of 1538 MSM were enrolled in the survey, 1511 of whom were tested for HIV and analyses were limited to this population.  Baseline characteristics of men who have sex with men by HIV status. Characteristics of anal sexual history. s.d., standard deviation. The prevalence of condom use or non-use with various anal sexual partners is shown in  Condom use with various sexual partners in the last 6 months. PrEP, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (for HIV); s.d., standard deviation. Reasons for condomless anal sex. Other reasons for CAI collected qualitatively include knowledge of partner status, unpreparedness, condom unavailability, being excited or carried away, disliking condoms, being in prison, having the perception that anal sex is safe, having an attractive partner, being embarrassed to get a condom, and condoms causing a rash. We found a high prevalence of CAI of at least 30% among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM. We also note that self-reported sexual behaviour may be subject to error and bias, thus underreporting of CAI is possible and may have led to underestimation of prevalence. HIV prevalence was high at 22.5%. In the context of the high HIV prevalence of 11.6% High levels of CAI might explain the elevated HIV prevalence in this key population. These findings suggest that the high prevalence of CAI among MSM in Zimbabwe is a complex issue affected by a range of factors. Another interesting finding is the various percentages of CAI depended on sexual positioning, that is whether or not one is insertive or receptive. Risks for acquiring or transmitting HIV and STIs via condomless anal sex vary according to sexual positioning. Specifically, men who participate in receptive anal intercourse were more likely to acquire HIV and rectal STIs compared to men who only participate in insertive anal intercourse. MSM are an important key population for HIV prevention and treatment in SSA and globally. Interventions to increase condom use and other sexual risk reduction strategies among MSM will need to address the situational context in which these men engage in sex and develop strategies that are adaptable to their environments. These efforts should not only focus on enhancing condom availability and access but also on tailored education to address misconceptions about HIV transmission risks and the benefits of condom use. Furthermore, interventions that tackle socio-economic factors, such as financial incentives for safe sex, may also be beneficial in this context. Importantly, this underscores the need for interventions to be multidimensional, addressing the intertwined nature of these risk factors. In fact, tackling accessibility issues without addressing the socio-behavioural and perceptual barriers may not effectively reduce CAI rates. As such, an integrated and holistic approach is necessary to mitigate the high levels of CAI and the subsequent elevated HIV prevalence in the MSM population in Zimbabwe. Outreach programmes, for example, have frequently been identified as a powerful strategy to engage these populations with vital health services. Overall, our findings indicate that there is potential for further HIV transmission among MSM in Zimbabwe, and an urgent need for increased HIV prevention efforts among this group in relation to optimising condom use. The main limitation is that our study was cross-sectional and based on behaviours reported in a face-to-face interview, and may be prone to social desirability responses. However, to our knowledge, this is the first large BBS that generated valuable information useful for analysing condomless anal sex among MSM in Zimbabwe.","['HIV', 'MSM', 'condomless anal intercourse', 'sexual behaviour', 'condom use', 'biobehavioural survey']",2024-9-30,Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11447591,"Community members’ perceptions of community health workers in Melusi, Tshwane, South Africa","Community health workers (CHWs) play an important role in health promotion through health campaigns and home visits, and provide linkage to care and support patient management. In the informal settlements, CHWs identify health challenges and help residents to access healthcare facilities. This study aimed to explore the perception held by the community members regarding CHWs’ contribution to health promotion in Melusi informal settlements within the Tshwane district. The study was conducted in Melusi informal settlement situated in Pretoria west in South Africa. Descriptive exploratory qualitative research methods were used, with open and closed-ended questions during individual interview sessions. Participants were purposefully selected in collaborating with the community leaders and using CHWs’ data to identify individuals with direct interaction with CHWs. Participants praised CHWs’ communication skills, engagement strategies, and ability to provide valuable health services. Community members expected CHWs to provide healthcare services, educational support, advocacy for health issues and guidance on well-being. Barriers such as community resistance, a lack of privacy and difficulties in reaching households were noticed. However, CHWs were commended for their impact on well-being, offering health services, emergency support, food assistance and improved healthcare accessibility. The study indicates that community members have positive perceptions of CHWs. This highlights the significant role of CHWs in promoting health and well-being within the community. This study provides insights into community perceptions of CHWs in informal settlements, emphasising their impact on community well-being. It provides a basis for their effectiveness and support in delivering health services in the informal settlement.","The City of Tshwane has a number of informal settlements where communities are faced with healthcare challenges. In these settlements, residents usually experience health-related issues, limited access to formal healthcare and a lack of service delivery. The role of community health workers (CHWs) is vital in health promotion given the need for community-driven healthcare solutions. The CHWs are an integral part of the Community Orientated Primary Care (COPC) approach. The CHWs are trained and equipped with various skills and taught how to implement the training practically. They employ various methods, such as health promotion, counselling and education to individuals and households within the community. Low- and middle-income countries face several challenges in providing basic healthcare to their populations, primarily because of financial, infrastructural and human resource constraints. Community perceptions play an important role in understanding the effectiveness and acceptance of CHWs and their role in health promotion within the community. This study explored the perceptions held by the community members residing in the Melusi informal settlement in the City of Tshwane district. A descriptive exploratory qualitative study design was used to uncover the deeper meanings and essence of residents’ perceptions regarding CHW’s roles in health promotion within informal settlements, providing valuable insights for improving community-oriented healthcare interventions. The study used both open and closed-ended questions when conducting in-depth interviews. This study examined the lived experiences and perceptions of residents residing in Melusi informal settlements regarding the role of CHWs in health promotion. The study took place in Melusi informal settlement in Pretoria West within the City of Tshwane District, South Africa. Melusi is a growing informal settlement located within Greater Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in the Gauteng province. The primary healthcare services for this community are rendered at Daspoort Poli-Clinic and Hercules Clinic while Pretoria West Hospital and Kalafong provides the secondary healthcare services. The Melusi community is served by 22 CHWs who conduct household visits and provide assistance at the local clinic. Each CHW is assigned to approximately 250 households, where they engage in a wide range of health promotion activities and preventive measures. Their responsibilities include identifying individuals with poor treatment compliance and providing education to enhance adherence to medical regimens. Beyond this, CHWs play a crucial role in offering basic health education, promoting healthy lifestyles and advocating for public health initiatives within the community. They assist in the management of chronic diseases by monitoring patients’ health status and ensuring continuity of care. The CHWs also provide psychosocial support to patients and their families, helping them navigate the healthcare system and access necessary services. They are instrumental in mobilising community resources and fostering community participation in health-related activities. Their efforts include organising health campaigns, conducting workshops and disseminating information on disease prevention and health maintenance. The community operates a satellite clinic led by a clinical associate and a nurse, offering acute management and screening for both non-communicable and communicable diseases. This clinic functions twice a week, with two CHWs rotating to assist in various tasks, such as taking vital signs, weighing infants, conducting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests and linking patients to the nearest primary healthcare facility for chronic disease services. The study participants were residents of the Melusi informal settlement. These individuals represented the target group whose perceptions regarding the role of CHWs in health promotion were investigated. The recruitment process for this study followed a carefully planned approach to identify and select participants who align with the inclusion criteria. The criteria for inclusion encompassed individuals aged 18 years and above residing in Melusi, who had direct exposure to CHWs and health promotion activities. Candidates were excluded if they lacked direct interaction with CHWs or if they were visiting but not residing within the Melusi area. The sample size for this study was determined through a process guided by the study’s qualitative design, specifically aiming to achieve data saturation where no new information or themes emerge from additional data collection. Following guidelines in the qualitative research literature by Guest et al. and Saunders et al., which suggest that a minimum of 12 to 20 participants is often sufficient to achieve data saturation, we focussed on including a diverse group of participants from the Melusi informal settlement. Potential participants were identified through purposeful sampling, involving collaborating with community leaders, local organisations and data collected by CHWs using the COPC approach. Households listed on the CHWs’ records as receiving care were visited. During these visits, the head of each household was informed about the study and invited to nominate an adult participant who had experience with CHWs. This approach ensured that participants selected for the study were knowledgeable about the role of CHWs and had relevant experiences to contribute. After recruitment, the researcher initiated contact with the participants and then clarified the study’s objectives. A clear overview of the research aims and the importance of their perspectives was provided during the initial communication. Individuals expressing interest in participating were provided with a detailed informed consent form. Participants had the opportunity to ask questions and only proceed if they voluntarily provided written consent. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection, aiming to get detailed information on the community’s perception of CHWs’ role in health promotion. The interview guide was developed by the researcher aligning with the study’s aim and focussing on how community members perceive CHWs’ impact on the health outcome in the informal settlements in the Tshwane district (Supplementary File 1). The researcher used the interview guide during the data collection to ensure consistency throughout the data collection process. Interviews were conducted either at the participant’s household or at the Melusi Clinic for those unable to host at home. The interviews took place in person and were conducted in the participants’ home language to facilitate open and meaningful communication. Participants were encouraged to freely express their views and opinions in their preferred language. The process began with providing participants comprehensive information about the study, allowing them to ask questions to ensure clarity. Once participants fully understood the study, they were presented with a consent form to sign if they chose to participate. The primary question posed to participants was, ‘Do you believe that CHWs play a significant role in addressing these health challenges? Why or why not?’ Probing questions were used to delve deeper into responses (Supplementary File 1). Participants were asked a combination of open-ended and close-ended questions to explore their experiences thoroughly. All information collected during the interviews was recorded and field notes were documented both during and after each interview to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data. The transcription process followed guidelines for qualitative research methodologies by Guest et al., ensuring accuracy, context preservation and consistency throughout. To analyse the data, the first author, RKM, used ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany (ATLAS.ti 24) for coding to identify recurring phrases and ideas. Direct quotes were incorporated to accurately reflect the participants’ statements. The process began with data familiarisation, followed by defining the unit of analysis and identifying relevant segments. To ensure the quality and trustworthiness of our study, we adhered to established qualitative research criteria, including credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability and authenticity. Ethical clearance to conduct this study was obtained from the University of Pretoria, Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (No. 664/2023). The COPC Research Unit and the Melusi community leaders granted permission for the study to be conducted in Melusi community. Individuals who agreed to participate in the study were required to sign an informed consent form. The study comprised of 20 participants, with 3 males and 17 females as detailed in  Characteristics of study participants. Numerous themes emerged concerning the community’s perception of CHWs and their role in health promotion within Melusi’s informal settlement. These themes include community’s expectations from CHWs, the role of CHWs in addressing health challenges and barriers and recommendations for improvement ( Community perceptions and recommendations: Themes and sub-themes from a study on community health workers in Melusi. CHWs, Community health workers; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TB, tuberculosis; STI, sexually transmitted infection. Participants commended CHWs for their effective communication skills and capacity to deliver invaluable health services: ‘They know how to speak to people and they know how to explain themselves. They are good when it comes to come to getting attention from a person. They service is just good.’ (P20_F_31) ‘The care workers once visited me, they spoke to me in a nice manner and with smiles.’ (P10_F_29) ‘Yes, the interaction was amazing and they were all so informative about the questions I had for them.’ (P12_F_29) One participant remarked on the CHWs’ courteous demeanour and thoroughness during household visits, while another acknowledged the timely and helpful support provided during a challenging situation involving a sick family member: ‘They are good people, they spoke nicely with us and they counted us to know how many we are in the house.’ (P17_F_33) ‘The visit was right, because I had a sick family member and they assisted me with her.’ (P4_F_54) Participants admired CHWs’ determination in their door-to-door efforts: ‘They persevere and reach people with their door-to-door initiative even when it is difficult.’ (P5_F_39) Expectations were voiced regarding CHWs providing access to health services, which included offering information about nearby clinics, conducting HIV and pregnancy tests, screening for TB and diabetes during household visits, and facilitating connections between community members and social workers. When asked about the health-related services or support they expect from CHWs, the participants responded: ‘HIV testing and testing for diabetes and also TB (tuberculosis). Most people around are coughing a lot.’ (P19_F_33) ‘They should help the sick, they should inform us about the clinics near us. They should also give us information on where we can get help from social workers.’ (P11_F_29) Participants expressed expectations for CHWs to advocate for health issues and provide guidance on maintaining well-being: ‘They must help with sick family members, ensure they eat well, and adhere to their treatment.’ (P3_F_28) There was an expectation for CHWs to assist with children not attending school, providing educational support and guidance: ‘I expect them to assist with children who are not attending school. Those children need education.’ (P17_F_33) One participant anticipates collaboration between CHWs and nurses, particularly in instances where the clinic is inaccessible, to provide assistance to the community across various needs: ‘They should do their community rounds with nurses, due to the fact that sometimes the clinic isn’t available. They also assist the community with any other help they might need from them.’ (P14_F_30) In this theme, participants shared their observations of how CHWs address health challenges. Perceptions from participants suggest that CHWs contribute by providing guidance and referrals for community members to start treatment: ‘They also assisted a lot of people to start treatment.’ (P11_F_29) ‘Okay, my mother was unwell and sometimes was not able to go to the clinic, so one care worker assisted with referring her to the clinic, and till today she doesn’t suffer whenever she goes to the clinic.’ (P12_F_29) ‘They came to me and asked for my information and status, and I disclosed. They asked me if I am on treatment or not. When I said I was not on treatment they encouraged me to go to the clinic a check if I am not yet on a stage where I should be starting treatment, likely I got there right on time and I was put on treatment. Ever since I have started everything is going well I am healthy.’ (P6_F_54) They support in treatment adherence, ensuring that household members who are unable to reach health facilities receive their medication during household visits: ‘They also bring some patients pills when they cannot go collect for themselves.’ (P14_F_30) Participants highlighted instances where CHWs played a role in promoting acceptance of health conditions, especially in cases related to HIV: ‘There was a sick lady who was sick but did not go to the clinic to seek help and she was not on any treatment. She was coughing, those people came and talked to her and encouraged her to go to the clinic. She is now doing very well, you will not even tell it’s her.’ (P5_F_39) Participants underscored the comprehensive role of CHWs, including addressing instances of abuse within the community: ‘They helped someone to escape abuse, they referred the person to a social worker so that that person can get the help they needed.’ (P11_F_29) Participants also underscored the significance of CHWs in conducting health assessments directly from homes: ‘[ ‘They help with doing health checks and testing from the homes since most community members are afraid of going to the clinic.’ (P3_F_28) The CHWs were commended for their holistic approach to community well-being. Beyond medical services, they extend support in obtaining social benefits, such as providing food parcels: ‘They helped us with getting food parcels and vouchers which was a very great initiative and we are grateful.’ (P1_M_32) ‘They assist with food parcels and mostly they have and know relevant solutions and information to any problems we might have in the community.’ (P13_F_67) One participant recounted an impactful intervention by CHWs, where they provided guidance and support to a vulnerable child in the community: ‘They once helped this other child who did not have a birth certificate, not in school, and abusing alcohol. This child was so wrong that she would swear at her parents always at the tavern drinking and even changing boyfriends. They came and encouraged her that education is the key and tavern will not pay her, they also gave her an advice that having different partners is not good she will end up being sick. They guided her to go to school so she can succeed in life.’ (P10_F_29) Another participant highlighted CHWs’ educational outreach efforts regarding alcohol abuse and school attendance during household visits: ‘[ Participants recounted situations where CHWs encountered resistance, hostility or rudeness from community members, including instances where some individuals refused to open their gates or doors, while others even chased them away: ‘Community members do not want them, they are not welcoming them into their home others even close their gates.’ (P13_F_67) Participants continued to highlight the difficult circumstances faced by CHWs, observing instances where they were subjected to verbal abuse and insults, and encountered young children in vulnerable situations because of the absence of parental care: ‘Most households are not welcoming and do not treat them well. Some chase them away, others shout at them and swear at them.’ (P11_F_29) ‘People swear at them, they insult them and, in some cases, they find young children with parents who have long passed away, this comes as a barrier because the children are too young to take care of themselves.’ (P16_F_42) Participants expressed concerns about the confidentiality of their health information when interacting with CHWs, with one noting uncertainty about specific issues but highlighting apprehensions regarding the disclosure of illnesses to others: ‘I do not know what specific problems they are facing. But I think some people don’t like them because some say they disclose their illnesses to other people.’ (P4_F_54) Another participant emphasised the importance of maintaining confidentiality to enable individuals to fully disclose their health concerns and receive assistance: ‘People cannot disclose to the community health workers and this hinders them to do their job in the community.’ (P6_F_54) ‘According to how I know their work and since we have different sicknesses, I would appreciate it if they can assist those who cannot help themselves and also what is spoken with every patient should be kept confidential at all times.’ (P6_F_54) Participants stressed the challenges faced by CHWs, who operate within designated working hours, in reaching households where occupants are employed during those hours: ‘In cases where there is a severely sick person in the household, they cannot come and make sure that the patient takes their medication on time since they have working hours (they do not work 24/7.’ (P1_M_32) ‘They should work full-time for elderly people and for chronic especially those living with HIV, people mostly do not accept their statuses and do not take their treatments well.’ (P7_F_33) The majority of participants identified communicable diseases, particularly HIV, TB, and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), as the most pressing health challenges faced by residents of the informal settlements in the City of Tshwane: ‘Mostly its HIV, they are struggling with HIV.’ (P8_F_40) ‘The first and high illness is HIV/AIDS followed by STIs, TB and flu is also common.’ (P20_F_31) Diabetes and hypertension were the two non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that participants pointed out among the most pressing health challenges faced by residents, followed by depression: ‘High Blood Pressure and sugar diabetes. Is depression a health problem?’ (P7_F_33) ‘We can include depression, most ladies who are staying with their boyfriends suffer from depression. It is a big challenge.’ (P7_F_33) To enhance the recognition and acceptance of CHWs within the community, a participant recommended organising health education workshops and community meetings to raise awareness about the role of CHWs: ‘If only we can have health education workshops to educate the community about health workers and their roles in the community.’ (P3_F_28) In addition, it was recommended that CHWs should establish focus groups to educate the community about health-related issues and life skills: ‘They can also create focus groups where they can educate us about health-related issues and life.’ (P10_F_29) Emphasising confidentiality, a participant proposed a community meeting to reassure residents about the privacy of discussions with CHWs: ‘I think there should be a meeting with the community, to reassure them that all things discussed with community health workers will remain highly confidential.’ (P4_F_54) One participant recommended the hiring of more CHWs, accentuating their value and the community’s need for their assistance: ‘I would recommend that they hire more community health workers, they are very helpful and we need them.’ (P5_F_39) Another participant recommended extending clinic hours, hiring more staff, and expanding facilities: ‘I can recommend that our clinic can improve and work 24hrs, also that they should hire enough health workers and if we can have nurses and a doctor and they should extend the clinic.’ (P11_F_2) This study involved 20 participants to explore community perceptions of CHWs and their role in health promotion. The participants in this study were mainly female (85%). Participants praised CHWs for their communication skills, engagement strategies and ability to provide valuable health services. Community viewed CHWs not just as sources of information but also as supportive figures during health-related challenges. Community members expressed various expectations from CHWs, including healthcare services, educational support, advocacy for health issues and guidance on well-being. Despite these positive perceptions, participants found barriers such as community resistance, lack of privacy and difficulties in reaching households, which hindered CHWs’ effectiveness. However, CHWs were commended for their impact on community well-being, offering health services, emergency support, food assistance and improved healthcare accessibility. The findings show that study participants from the Melusi informal settlement had positive perceptions of CHWs, highlighting their role as valuable resources in the community. The positive perception findings of this study align with the consistent evidence from previous research, which has continually emphasised the favourable perceptions of CHWs. The CHWs were not only seen as information sharers but also as supportive figures during health-related challenges in the community. Their role and being trusted in the community have been shown to be important in delivering health promotion and behaviour change. This serves as a reflection of the community’s desire for proactive health promotion. It highlights the urge for community members to be guided regarding healthier lifestyles by CHWs. The CHWs are often seen as a link connecting communities and formal healthcare systems, addressing gaps in access and service. The study participants highlighted that the role of CHWs is important, especially in promoting health in the informal settlement of the City of Tshwane. The community sees CHWs as health educators and are of the view that it is important for them to share health information about health issues faced by community members. This aligns with the proactive role of CHWs in health promotion. The findings in this study show that CHWs play an important role in advising on medication adherence, offering advice during household visits and providing essential health services. The CHWs are often involved in a range of activities, including disease prevention, health promotion and social support. The positive impact of CHWs on community well-being, including their role in providing essential health services, promoting acceptance of health conditions and supporting clinic visits, is well-documented in the literature. Despite community members having positive perceptions regarding CHWs, the study also identified several difficulties that prevent CHWs from rendering services. These included community resistance, a lack of privacy and confidentiality, and difficulties in reaching households. This concurs with what other studies have found, which is that CHWs encounter various challenges in their role such as resource constraints, a lack of recognition and inadequate support of the health system. The community members’ fear of breach of confidentiality highlights the need to reinforce the importance of confidentiality among CHWs and also raise awareness in the community about the ethical standards CHWs maintain when handling sensitive health information. Working on protecting community confidentiality and addressing challenges in open communication can further enhance the effectiveness of CHWs in the community as suggested by a participant in this study. Expectations for confidentiality emphasise the ethical considerations in CHWs’ interactions. Participants acknowledged CHWs’ engagement beyond healthcare. This study shows that there are constraints in CHWs’ working hours, which create a barrier to reaching certain community members. Having a different approach such as CHWs working with flexible scheduling might help address this challenge. Participants in the study from the informal settlements of the City of Tshwane mentioned a wide range of health issues. Communicable diseases such as TB, HIV, and STIs were considered to be major health risks within the community. Health interventions are required to enhance patient outcomes and prevent the disease from spreading. To increase CHWs’ efficacy in promoting health in the City of Tshwane’s informal settlements, study participants offered several suggestions. A crucial suggestion was to arrange community gatherings and workshops on health education to increase understanding of the function of CHWs and advance community health literacy. This recommendation highlights the value of community involvement and education in enhancing health outcomes and giving residents the power to take charge of their health. Participants recommended that in the community meetings, residents should be reassured on the confidentiality of their conversations held with between community member and CHWs. This recommendation emphasises the value of confidentiality and trust in healthcare interactions because it can motivate residents to ask for assistance and be transparent about their health concerns. Setting up focus groups to inform the public about health-related concerns and life skills was another suggestion. This recommendation emphasises the value of community-based learning and the part CHWs play in helping community people gain a greater understanding of health and well-being. This study emphasises how important CHWs are in promoting health in the district of the City of Tshwane informal settlements particularly Melusi. The positive perception of CHWs by community members highlights how they are valuable resources in the community. The CHWs are essential in addressing health challenges, even though CHWs face challenges such as community resistance, hostility from community members, concerns about confidentiality and difficulties reaching households during non-working hours. To improve the situation, participants recommended having health education workshops, community meetings and focus groups to raise community awareness and enhance community understanding of CHWs’ roles. They also suggested increasing the visibility of CHWs in the community and hiring more CHWs. In general, CHWs play an important role in preserving community access to health, raising health awareness and improving overall community health and well-being. Achieving data saturation in this study was crucial to comprehensively capture the study topic, suggesting minimal additional insights from further data collection. The selection of participants was a strength, enhancing representativeness and providing diverse perspectives on CHWs in the community. Direct interaction with CHWs and health promotion activities enriched understanding of community views. Detailed descriptions of the study setting and participant selection process bolstered the transferability of findings, offering a thorough account of perceptions in the Melusi informal settlement and facilitating comparisons with other communities’ views on CHWs. The study encountered logistical constraints in locating participants’ addresses, particularly in Melusi, an informal settlement where some residences lack formal addresses. These challenges hindered the ability to effectively contact and include all intended participants, potentially limiting the study’s scope and generalisability. The study may not have fully represented the whole viewpoint about informal settlements in the City of Tshwane because the focus was on participant’s perceptions. The study may not have been as applicable to other informal settlements with diverse environment or people because it focussed on a specific informal settlement in the City of Tshwane. Policy implications from the study highlight the need for enhancing CHWs’ communication skills and engagement strategies to effectively convey health information and foster positive interactions with community members. Policymakers should ensure that CHWs meet community expectations by providing essential health services, advocating for health issues and supporting comprehensive care through referrals and educational support. Addressing challenges such as limited working hours and community resistance requires policies that expand capacity and support systems of CHW, aiming to improve health outcomes in managing prevalent health challenges such as communicable diseases, NCDs and mental health issues.","['community health workers', 'health promotion', 'informal settlement', 'community perception', 'barriers', 'healthcare accessibility']",2024-9-19,African Journal of Primary Health Care & Family Medicine,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11446210,From Awareness to Action: Pioneering Solutions for Women’s UTI Challenges in the Era of Precision Medicine,"This article aims to bring clinicians’ awareness to the widespread impact of urinary tract infection (UTI) on the lives of women and to the advances that offer hope for future improvements in the diagnosis and management of UTI. Thanks to physiological, anatomical, and lifestyle factor differences, women face heightened vulnerability to UTIs compared to men. In fact, women are four times more likely than men to develop a UTI and around half of these women encounter UTI recurrence, which is a significant source of both physical and psychosocial burdens. Despite the current shortcomings in diagnosis and management, emerging diagnostic technologies promise to identify UTIs more accurately and rapidly, offering women hope for a revolution in UTI management. Meanwhile, clinicians have the opportunity to reduce the psychosocial burden by recognizing the value of patients’ lived experiences and ensuring their care plan is in alignment with their patients’ goals and expectations for medical care.","UTIs occur anywhere from the urethra to the kidneys, manifesting as cystitis or pyelonephritis based on the infection’s location. The diagnosis of a clinical UTI requires both the presence of symptoms and the confirmation of uropathogenic microorganisms in the urine. The term ASB has been used to describe the presence of bacteria in the urinary tract in the absence of any clinical urinary symptoms. Limitations in standard urine culture (SUC) have upheld the misconception that urine is sterile. SUC methodology is biased toward detecting classical gram-negative uropathogens, such as  Approximately 60% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime Due to being one of the most prevalent infections in women, UTIs are also a leading cause of prescribed antibiotics. The physical health consequences of UTI can be severe. UTI in pregnancy can result in premature rupture of membranes and low birth weight. Awareness of the detrimental impacts of UTI on women’s quality of life has been gaining increasing appreciation since the turn of the millennium. Very recently, the Recurrent UTI Impact Questionnaire (RUTIIQ), was validated and optimized for assessing the patient-reported psychosocial impact of living with recurrent UTI symptoms and pain as a unique tool to improve patient-centered care. Because point-of-care tests do not require being sent to a lab for testing, they are generally cheaper, easier, and faster. As such, the quest for new and improved point-of-care tests is continuous. However, none are currently sufficient for UTI diagnosis when used as independent tests. Standard urine culture (SUC) has been regarded as the gold standard for UTI diagnostic testing for decades. A growing number of sensitive diagnostic methods are being investigated, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), mass spectrometry, expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC), and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) to improve testing accuracy. EQUC is a culture-dependent method that employs a wide array of environmental conditions to encourage the growth of microorganisms for identification and quantification but does not provide antibiotic susceptibility data. M-PCR based tests use extracted microbial DNA to rapidly identify infectious organisms with higher sensitivity and specificity than standard cultures. The second limitation of M-PCR-based diagnostic tests reliance on nucleic acid identification rather than culture is an inability to provide antibiotic susceptibility information. One approach to counter this limitation without resorting to performing SUC with AST in parallel is to design M-PCR assays to detect antibiotic resistance (ABR) genes. However, in UTI cases, a reported 40% discordance between ABR gene detection and susceptibility phenotypes demonstrates that the detection of an ABR gene may not translate into phenotypic resistance, nor can the absence of an ABR gene absence guarantee susceptibility. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a culture-free pathogen detection based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. In comparison to M-PCR, mNGS microorganism detections are not limited by a pre-determined set of probes and primers. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass-spectrometry delivers rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms and is available to clinical laboratories on two FDA-approved systems. The main disadvantage is that the method requires a pure culture of bacteria, meaning it is most commonly used as a supplemental method for identifying bacterial colonies isolated following SUC, and therefore, MALDI-TOF exhibits many of the same time and sensitivity limitations. The immune response in the urinary tract involves pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins (ILs), as well as bacteriostatic agents, such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). The development of diagnostic tests with improved sensitivity and specificity combined with an increasing understanding of the urobiome is likely to lead to improved management of UTI and other dysbiosis-associated urologic conditions. Improved diagnostic speed and accuracy will reduce the prevalence of misdiagnoses, enabling better antibiotic stewardship and improving clinical outcomes. Medical providers and researchers alike must recognize that women bear a disproportionate physical and psychosocial burden from UTIs, particularly due to missed diagnoses and failed treatments. Hope for a better future exists in advancements in understanding UTI pathogenesis and in the growing number of sensitive diagnostic methods being investigated, but we must be diligent in continuing to investigate and improve these methods. We must also strive to reduce the described discrepancies between patient and clinician perspectives, such as through shared decision-making or other communication improvement strategies. Together, advancements in diagnostic methodology and improving communication between clinicians and patients hold the potential to offer unprecedented relief to women suffering from UTIs.","['women’s health', 'urinary tract infection', 'urine culture', 'multiplex-polymerase chain reaction', 'metagenomic next-generation sequencing', 'mass spectrometry']",2024-9-28,International Journal of Women's Health,"""sexually transmitted infection"""

Systemic symptoms of infection, such as fever and chills, were present. There was no accompanying skin rash, arthritis, dysuria, or urethral discharge. He had sought medical attention at a walk-in clinic 5 days prior where he was prescribed a 10-day course of empiric oral clindamycin 500 mg twice daily without symptomatic improvement. His medical history was significant for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sialadenitis, and poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (with a hemoglobin A On examination, he was alert and in no acute distress. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His airway was patent with no stridor, and he talked with a muffled voice. Inspection of the oral cavity showed no tonsillar exudate. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed a normal nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The base of the tongue was erythematous and bulky displacing the epiglottis posteriorly. There was no edema or eythema of the epiglottis, vocal cords, and arytenoids. The airway was not obstructed, and the vocal cords were mobile. Palpation of the anterior neck disclosed a tender swelling overlying the hyoid. Other than for bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, the remainder of the examination was within normal limits. Results of investigations showed no leukocytosis and a negative heterophile antibody test. A chest x-ray showed a normal result. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck disclosed a 3.7 × 3.4 × 2-cm loculated rim-enhancing lesion along the posterior root of the tongue extending to the tongue base with involvement of the peristaltic space with mild thickening of the epiglottis (Fig.  Axial (A) and sagittal (B) CT scan images with contrast showing a lobulated rim-enhancing lesion along the posterior midline root of the tongue extending posteriorly to the base of the tongue and preepiglottic space with stranding of the preepiglottic fat and mild epiglottic thickening.

He was discharged on oral clindamycin pending results of the abscess culture. The isolation of  Further evaluation revealed that his sexual encounters were exclusively heterosexual, with the last exposure occurring 1 month before symptomatic onset in which he engaged in active orogenital contact with an anonymous partner. There was no history of sexually transmitted infections. Screening for concomitant sexually transmitted infections showed no serologic evidence of infection due to HIV, syphilis, hepatitis A, or hepatitis B. A single 250-mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone was administered. Follow-up assessment indicated that complete clinical and radiologic resolution of the thyroglossal duct cyst abscess had occurred. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital anterior neck masses, accounting for 70% of all such congenital neck anomalies. The cyst develops when the thyroglossal duct connecting the developing thyroid gland to its final position in the neck fails to atrophy. The clinical recognition of the cyst differs between children and adults in which an asymptomatic anterior neck mass After radiologic confirmation by either high-resolution ultrasound or CT scans of the neck, Although the most likely pathogens causing thyroglossal duct cyst infections would be anticipated to arise from the endogenous residential oropharyngeal microflora, there is a paucity of literature detailing the organisms isolated from these infections that have included  Our patient is the second case of an infected thyroglossal duct cyst due to  Pharyngeal gonococcal infection and thyroglossal duct cysts share a cryptic clinical feature commonly typified by asymptomatic presentation.

11443646,"Influence of socio-contextual factors on the link between traditional and new media use, and young people’s sexual risk behaviour in Sub-Saharan Africa: a secondary data analysis","Traditional and new media use links to young people’s sexual risk behaviour. The social contexts of young people’s daily lives that influence media use and sexual risk behaviour are often investigated as independent causal mechanisms. We examined the link between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour, considering the intersecting socio-contextual factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. Age-adjusted bivariate logistic regression models tested the association between traditional media (TV, radio, and newspapers), and new media (mobile phone and online) use and sexual risk behaviour using the Demographic and Health Surveys from six Sub-Saharan African countries among unmarried sexually active youths, aged 15–24 years. Multivariate logistic regression models ascertained the media sources that had an additional influence on young people’s sexual risk behaviour, after accounting for socio-contextual factors, and knowledge about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Socio-contextual factors attenuated the association between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour in many countries. However, those who did not have access to new and traditional media were more likely to use unreliable contraceptive methods or not use contraception. Adolescents in Nigeria who did not own phones were 89% more likely to use unreliable contraceptive methods or not use any methods [(AOR = 1.89 (1.40–2.56), p < .001)], those in Angola who did not read newspapers had higher odds of not using contraception or used unreliable methods [(aOR = 1.65 (1.26–2.15), p < .001)]. Young people in Angola (aOR = 0.68 (0.56–0.83), p < .001), Cameroon [(aOR = 0.66 (0.51–0.84), p < .001)], Nigeria [(aOR = 0.72 (0.56–0.93), p = .01)], and South Africa [(aOR = 0.69 (0.49–0.98), p = .03)] who did not own phones were less likely to have 2 or more sexual partners compared to those who owned phones. Lack of internet access in Mali was associated with lower odds of having 2 or more sexual partners (aOR = 0.45 (0.29–0.70), p < .001). Traditional media use was significantly associated with transactional sex in many countries. Media use is linked to sexual risk behaviour among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Socioeconomic inequalities, levels of globalization, as well as rural–urban disparities in access to media, underscore the need to deliver tailored and targeted sexual risk reduction interventions to young people using both traditional and new media. In addition to television, radio, magazines, and newspapers, young people in Sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly using their phones and the Internet to connect with their peers. However, these media sources can lead to sexual risk behaviour because of access to inappropriate and inaccurate information. Social environmental factors in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as gender, place of residence, and socio-economic status influence young people’s access to and use of these media sources. However, many studies that consider the influence of these social factors on the use of media among young people evaluate each of them and fail to consider that these social forces jointly influence young people’s access to the internet, and ability to own phones, watch television, or read newspapers. Our study considered these combined social factors and their influence on the link between the use of media and sexual risk behaviour among young people. We found that considering these social environmental factors reduced the association between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour but those who did not have access to these media sources were more likely to use unreliable methods to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. Those who listened to the radio, or read newspapers and magazines were more likely to give or receive cash or other gifts in exchange for sex. In contrast, young people who never owned phones or lacked access to the internet were less likely to have had multiple sexual partners. Our findings stress the need to consider social contexts and media use in promoting young people’s sexual health.","Sexual risk behaviour among young people remains a major public health concern in Sub-Saharan Africa, where risky sexual behaviour and related adverse health outcomes are disproportionately higher compared to high-income countries [ New media refers to internet-based applications that permit access to videos, digital texts, images, associated web links, and user interactions [ Consequently, many programs and interventions that focus on promoting youths’ sexual and reproductive health in Sub-Saharan Africa leverage the ubiquitous use of new media, particularly mobile phones by young people to communicate factual and comprehensive sexual health information [ Besides, the new media, traditional media (such as television, radio, newspapers, and magazines) are sources of sexual and reproductive health, and HIV-related information in Sub-Saharan Africa [ Given the curiosity and exploration that occur during these developmental years, studies suggest that young people in Sub-Saharan Africa access uncensored sexually explicit materials that are easily available on the internet [ However, not all young people in Sub-Saharan Africa have access to new and traditional media sources because of the social circumstances of their daily lives [ Additionally, there is conflicting evidence about the role that social factors play in the link between media use and risky sexual behaviour among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, one study that pooled the Demographic and Health Survey datasets from 27 Sub-Saharan African countries reported that adolescent girls and young unmarried women, who listened to the radio, lived in urban areas, belonged to high social class, or were employed had higher odds of having had a sexually transmitted infection [ Specifically, we addressed the following research questions; (1) What is the association between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour, over and beyond other social factors? (2) How do young people’s HIV and other STIs knowledge modify the influence of media on their sexual risk behaviour? (3) What are the between-country and regional differences in the link between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour? Our study was a secondary analysis of the publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) datasets (2014–2018) from six Sub-Saharan African countries. Demographic and Health Surveys use nationally representative samples to monitor population health. The surveys are carried out every five years by the DHS Program, an agency of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in collaboration with participating countries. The DHS uses a cross-sectional design and two-stage sampling to select clusters and households, and an interviewer-administered questionnaire collects information from participants, aged 15–49 in selected households. The DHS has standard model questionnaires that collect health information separately from men, women, and entire households [ More details about the DHS and its administration are provided elsewhere [ We selected the sub-sample of all the unmarried sexually active young people, aged 15–24 years, in countries that met our inclusion criteria. We considered the national income classification, geographical location of the country in Sub-Saharan Africa, data availability, and consistency of the items that assessed traditional and new media use among young people. We included countries that had measures for phone ownership, access to the internet, and traditional media sources, as well as measures of sexual risk behaviour among young people. For statistical power and to allow for between-country comparisons of adolescent sexual risk behaviour, we selected countries with a population of twenty million or more. We used the World Bank’s Classification of Sub-Saharan African countries based on their Gross National Income (GNI) to categorize these countries into low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries. This will facilitate an understanding of how the link between media use and sexual and reproductive risk behaviour is similar or different across countries in the region. The countries we included in the study were Angola, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa. Engagement with multiple sexual partners, transactional sex, and contraceptive use (non-use, the use of unreliable contraceptive methods, and the use of modern methods of contraception) among young people were the outcome variables in our study. Our study sample included all unmarried sexually active young people, given their heightened risk of sexual risk behaviour. We used the variable that assessed the number of sexual partners in the 12 months before the survey to assess engagement in sexual risk behaviours. We reasoned that the variable that asked for the number of sexual partners in the last 12 months facilitates easy recall of sexual activity among sexually active young people, so we used the variable that assessed the number of sexual partners in the last 12 months. Since a higher number of sexual partners increases the risk of HIV and other STIs, the number of sexual partners in the 12 months before the surveys was re-coded from a continuous variable to an ordinal level variable (no sexual partner, one sexual partner, two or more sexual partners). Transactional sex was assessed separately for males using the variable that asked whether male youths have ever exchanged cash or other gifts for sex, with females—we used the variable that asked whether they ever had sex in return for gifts, cash, or other material gratification. The measure of contraceptive method used by the participants was an ordinal level variable (no method, the use of traditional methods, and the use of modern methods of contraception). We dichotomized contraceptive method use at the time of the survey, so that, non-use of any contraceptive method and the use of traditional methods constitute non-use or the use of unreliable methods. While the use of modern methods of contraception represented the use of reliable contraceptive methods. The DHS conceptualizes the traditional methods of contraception as the use of periodic abstinence, coitus interruptus (withdrawal), and other country-specific folkloric methods, such as the use of herbs, amulets, etc. We reasoned that the non-use of contraception, or the use of unreliable methods, for example, folkloric and other methods that have higher failure rates compared to modern methods of contraception could expose young people to unintended pregnancy, as well as sexually transmitted infections including HIV. Further, early pregnancy and unintended pregnancy may result in unsafe abortion, early childbearing, or early marriage [ We included access to the internet and ownership of mobile phones as measures of new media use. These media sources were dichotomous variables that required a yes or no response. The measures of traditional media sources were the frequency of watching television, listening to the radio, and reading magazines and newspapers. The items that measured traditional media use were ordinal level variables (not at all, at least once a week, and almost every day). These measures were dichotomized so that no access to traditional media represented non-use, and the use of these media sources at least once a week and almost every day constituted access to these traditional media sources. We then included several socio-contextual factors that are associated with media use, and risky sexual behaviour among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa [ Further, we considered that level of education may influence engagement in sexual and reproductive risk behaviour. For example, available evidence indicates that lower levels of education correlate positively with engagement in sexual risk behaviour among young people [ Socioeconomic status was a proxy variable created from the DHS wealth quintile that incorporates not only participants' income but also inequalities in household characteristics and assets. The wealth quintiles were re-coded into poor, middle class, and rich. Ethnicity was re-coded into least, moderate, and most dominant groups in countries when the ethnic identities could be categorized into distinct groups. We included religious affiliation in all countries except South Africa because the variable was not available in the datasets. Head of the household was a dichotomous variable that categorized households into male- and female-headed households. Our study was a secondary analysis of existing anonymous datasets and did not require ethical review. Complex Sample frequencies and percentages described the characteristics of the sample. Rao-Scott’s adjusted chi-square tested the significant association between technology and media use and sexual risk behaviour. Binomial and ordinal logistic regression models tested the relationship between media use and sexual risk behaviour in each country. Next, we sequentially included the social factors in logistic regression models without replacement to assess the change in the influence of each socio-contextual factor on the relationship between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour. The multivariate models examined the media sources’ relationship, controlling for all the socio-contextual factors, on each sexual risk behaviour. Last, we included young people’s knowledge about HIV risk and other STIs in the final multivariate model to evaluate the independent influence of new and traditional media use on young people’s sexual risk behaviour, controlling for personal knowledge and socio-contextual factors. Additionally, we ascertained the media sources that had significant independent links to sexual risk behaviours, over and beyond other socio-contextual factors, as well as knowledge about HIV and other STIs. We adjusted for age in the logistic regression models because sexual risk behaviour and media use vary by age [ The results in Table  Sociodemographic characteristics The frequency distribution of sexual risk behaviours among the youths  Sexual risk behaviour among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa The age-adjusted logistic regression models on the relationship between technology and media and sexual risk behaviour  Age-adjusted bivariate logistic regression media use and sexual risk behaviour *P < .05 **P < .01 ***P < .001 On the other hand, in five out of the six countries, lack of access to the internet and no ownership of mobile phones was associated with higher odds of non-use or the use of unreliable methods of contraception. Lack of access to traditional media sources was also associated with higher odds of unreliable contraception or non-use of any contraceptive method in these five countries. In Cameroon, young people who did not have access to the internet, did not watch television, and did not listen to the radio were 96% (aOR = 1.96 (1.64–2.34), p = 0.000), 81% (aOR = 1.81 (1.36–2.41), p < 0.001), and 48% (aOR = 1.48 (1.24–1.76), p < 0.001) more likely to use unreliable contraceptive methods or not use any contraception at all. While lack of access to or non-use of both traditional and new media was significantly associated with engagement in transactional sex among both young women and young men in many countries, young men in Mali (aOR = 0.48 (0.24–0.98), p = 0.04) and South Africa (aOR = 0.24 (0.07–0.84), p = 0.02) who did not read newspapers were significantly less likely to report transactional sex. There was no significant association between technology and media use and engagement in transactional sex among young people in Ethiopia. The multivariate models reveal that socio-contextual factors modified the relationship between technology and media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour. In many countries, the socio-economic class of families, young people’s place of residence, religion, educational attainment, and employment status significantly influenced the link between media use and sexual risk behaviour. However, ownership of phones had an independent influence on having multiple sexual partners in four out of the six countries, after adjusting for socio-contextual factors. This relationship persisted even after adjusting for HIV and other STIs knowledge  Relationship between media use and sexual behaviour adjusting for social factors, HIV and other STIs knowledge *P < .05 **P < .01 ***P < .001 Similarly, social factors and HIV and other STI knowledge attenuated the relationship between media and contraceptive use; and after we accounted for HIV and other STI knowledge, those who did not read newspapers in Angola were 65% (aOR = 1.65 (1.26–2.15), p < 0.001), and in Nigeria were 85% (aOR = 1.89 (1.40–2.56), p < 0.001) more likely to use unreliable methods of contraception or not to use any form of contraception. Additionally, young men in Cameroon who did not own a phone were significantly less likely to engage in transactional sex (aOR = 0.53 (0.31–0.93), p = 0.02). With regards to traditional media use, young men in Mali who did not listen to radio were significantly less likely to have given cash or other gifts in exchange for sex (aOR = 0.41(0.18–0.94), p = 0.03). In contrast, their counterparts in South Africa were over five times (aOR = 5.33 (2.11–13.48), p < 0.001), and in Ethiopia were about four times more likely to engage in transactional sex (aOR = 3.60 (1.38–9.40), p = 0.009). On the other hand, young women in Nigeria who did not listen to the radio were 44% more likely (aOR = 1.44 (1.04–1.99), p = 0.02) to have engaged in transactional sex, and those who did not read newspapers and magazines were 77% more likely (aOR = 1.77 (1.67–2.69), p = 0.007) to have received cash, gift, or other materials in exchange for sex. We examined the link between traditional and new media use and adolescent sexual risk behaviour, accounting for the socio-contextual factors that influence young people’s sexual and reproductive risk behaviour in Sub-Saharan Africa. We also considered the influence of HIV and other STIs knowledge in the association between media use and young people’s sexual risk behaviour. The findings of our study underscore the importance of simultaneously considering the social context in which young people are embedded and the synergistic influence of these social forces on sexual risk behaviour among young people. While accounting for the contextual factors and knowledge about HIV and other STIs knowledge attenuated the link between media use and some sexual risk behaviour in many Sub-Saharan African countries, both new media, and traditional media use continued to contribute to many sexual risk behaviours among young people. Despite the influence of these contextual factors on the link between media use and adolescent sexual risk behaviour, there remained remarkable between-country and regional differences in the link between media use and many sexual risk behaviours. Our study reveals that having owned a mobile phone had the strongest independent influence on having multiple sexual partners in many countries, after accounting for these contextual factors and HIV and other STIs knowledge. This finding may be expected considering the proliferation of uncensored sexually explicit materials in Sub-Saharan Africa [ Further, simultaneously accounting for contextual factors and HIV and other STIs knowledge lessened the odds of non-use or the use of unreliable contraception that are associated with lack of media use. However, the use of unreliable contraception or non-use of contraceptive methods remained prevalent in many countries because of a lack of access to both traditional and new media. Our findings about the high prevalence of unreliable contraception or non-use of contraceptive methods do not match available evidence about the impact of mass media communications on improving contraceptive use, and the progress that has been made in meeting the contraceptive needs of young people in Sub-Saharan Africa [ Those who did not read newspapers in Cameroon were less likely to use unreliable contraception or not use any contraception. Similarly, boys in South Africa who did not read newspapers were less likely to engage in transactional sex. Cameroon and South Africa are highly globalized countries, and the use of the internet and phone ownership is remarkably high among young people. Since only a few youths read newspapers, the use of new media and other traditional media sources may exert a greater influence on sexual risk behaviour in those countries. On the other hand, boys in Mali and South Africa who listened to the radio had a higher likelihood of having exchanged cash or gifts for sex. These two countries are at various stages of globalization, with South Africa being a highly globalized country. On the other hand, a greater percentage of young people in Mali who participated in the survey listened to the radio, and it has been reported in previous studies that radio is commonly used among young people in Mali [ Similarly, young women in Nigeria who did not listen to the radio nor read newspapers and magazines were more likely to exchange sex for cash, gifts, or other material gratification. This finding could be because of the higher percentage of young people in Nigeria who did not have access to traditional media sources, and less than half of young people had access to the Internet. Poverty and the desire to own a phone may motivate girls and young women to seek cash, or other material gifts in exchange for sex [ We acknowledge that our study used cross-sectional data and thus we do not claim a causal relationship between media use and youth sexual risk behaviour. We also recognize that the socio-contextual factors we included in our model may not be exhaustive, given the myriad of social factors, and socio-cultural practices in Sub-Saharan Africa that influence health behaviours among young people. For instance, peer and family relationships may influence media use and sexual risk behaviour. These areas are worth exploring in future studies. Our study involved youths, aged 15 to 24 years, not younger adolescents, because the Demographic and Health Surveys do not include those aged 10–14 years. Despite these limitations, our study provides population-based evidence about the role of several contextual factors in the link between traditional and new media use, as well as the gaps that remain in preventing sexual and reproductive risk behaviour among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings reveal the importance of considering the embeddedness of young people within a wide array of intersecting socio-contextual factors that influence media use and engagement in sexual risk behaviour. We found that simultaneously accounting for socio-contextual factors and knowledge about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections attenuated the link between traditional and new media use and adolescent sexual risk behaviour in many Sub-Saharan African countries. However, media use (and lack of access to media) continues to be linked to sexual risk behaviour among young people in the region. Lack of access to traditional and new media sources links to unreliable contraception or non-use of any contraceptive methods. Further, young people, particularly boys who listened to the radio or read newspapers and magazines had higher odds of engaging in transactional sex in many countries. On the other hand, poverty, lack of access to sexual health information, and the desire to own mobile phones continue to expose young women to sexual risk behaviour. Young people who did not have mobile phones and lacked access to the internet were less likely to have multiple sexual partners in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. While progress has been made in reducing sexual risk behaviour among young people, gaps remain between countries and regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings have implications for country-specific and tailored sexual and reproductive health intervention programs to meet the sexual and reproductive information needs of young people from diverse social backgrounds using both traditional and new media.",[],2024-9-30,Reproductive Health,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11442320,"Bacterial sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men and transgender women using oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in Latin America (ImPrEP): a secondary analysis of a prospective, open-label, multicentre study","The global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) poses a challenge in the context of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programmes. We aimed to explore factors associated with prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women on PrEP in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. ImPrEP was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study that enrolled MSM and transgender women in the context of the public health systems of Brazil (14 sites), Mexico (four sites), and Peru (ten sites) between February, 2018, and June, 2021. Eligibility criteria followed regional PrEP guidelines at the study start, including participants aged 18 years and older, not living with HIV, and reporting at least one of the following in the previous 6 months: condomless anal sex (CAS), anal sex with partner(s) living with HIV, any bacterial STI, or transactional sex. Eligible participants were screened and enrolled on the same day to receive daily oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg). We assessed three outcomes: prevalent bacterial STIs, incident bacterial STIs, and recurrent bacterial STIs. Testing occurred at baseline and quarterly for syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, and anorectal gonorrhoea. Behavioural data were collected at baseline and quarterly. The study was registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, U1111-1217-6021. Among all 9509 participants included in the ImPrEP study (3928 [41·3%] in Brazil, 3288 [34·6%] in Mexico, and 2293 [24·1%] in Peru), 8525 (89·7%) had available STI results at baseline and were included in the prevalent STI analysis, and 7558 (79·5%) had available STI results during follow-up and were included in the incident and recurrent STI analyses. 2184 (25·6%) of 8525 participants had any bacterial STI at baseline. STI incidence during follow-up was 31·7 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 30·7–32·7), with the highest rate for anorectal chlamydia (11·6 cases per 100 person-years, 95% CI 11·0–12·2), followed by syphilis (10·5 cases per 100 person-years, 9·9–11·1) and anorectal gonorrhoea (9·7 cases per 100 person-years, 9·2–10·3). Although only 2391 (31·6%) of 7558 participants had at least one STI during follow-up, 915 (12·1%) participants had recurrent diagnoses, representing 2328 (61·2%) of 3804 incident STI diagnoses. Characteristics associated with prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs included younger age, multiple sex partners, receptive CAS, substance use, and previous STI diagnoses at baseline (incident or recurrent only). Our findings underscore the nuanced dynamics of STI transmission among MSM and transgender women across Latin America, highlighting an urgent need for tailored interventions to mitigate STI burden effectively, especially among the most susceptible individuals.

A meta-analysis of PrEP trials that mainly enrolled MSM from high-income locations after 2015 reported a pooled prevalence of any bacterial STI (syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chlamydia) of 23·9% (95% CI 18·6–29·6), with an incidence of 72·2 (95% CI 60·5–86·2) cases per 100 person years. 
 
 We searched PubMed between database inception and April 30, 2024, using the keywords “PrEP” or “pre-exposure prophylaxis”, combined with “sexually transmitted infections” (including “syphilis”, “gonorrhea”, and “chlamydia”), along with geographical qualifiers (“Latin America”, “Brazil”, “Mexico”, and “Peru”). There were no restrictions on publication date or language, resulting in the identification of 38 relevant manuscripts. Our review focused on literature concerning the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as transgender women, in Latin America. Despite the availability of PrEP through the public health systems of Brazil (since December, 2017), Mexico (since mid-2021), and Peru (since August, 2023), its scale-up remains restricted in the region. We found reports on STI incidence among PrEP users from implementation studies in Brazil and clinical trials such as iPrEX and HPTN083. However, evidence regarding incident STIs in Latin America remains scarce, with most published data primarily focusing on prevalence rates. Notably, none of these studies delved into factors associated with incident and recurrent STIs among PrEP users. Existing data indicate a substantial burden of STIs among MSM and PrEP users in Latin America, particularly syphilis. 
 The Implementation PrEP (ImPrEP) study was the largest PrEP implementation study in Latin America, evaluating the feasibility of same-day oral PrEP in the context of the public health systems of Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. The ImPrEP study reported data on prevalent and incident STIs for 8525 participants, drawing attention to the high prevalence and incidence of bacterial STIs among study participants, including syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, and anorectal gonorrhoea. Age younger than 30 years, self-identification as a non-White race, low educational background, high number of sexual partners, and receptive condomless anal sex (CAS) were associated with baseline prevalence of any bacterial STI. During study follow-up, younger age, non-White race, previous HIV post-exposure prophylaxis use, high number of sexual partners, receptive CAS, use of poppers, and STI diagnosis at enrolment were associated with incident and recurrent bacterial STIs. Regional differences can also be involved in STI transmission dynamics among PrEP users. We found STI incident diagnoses in about 30% of participants and recurrent STI diagnoses in 12% of participants. Participants diagnosed with any STI showed high adherence to PrEP, and reported multiple vulnerabilities related to sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics before starting PrEP. 
 Our findings underscore the substantial burden of STIs in Latin America, reinforcing the role of PrEP services as crucial venues for both diagnosis and timely treatment of these conditions. Furthermore, our findings emphasise the importance of adopting a combined prevention approach. Despite the observed high incidence of STIs, our data suggest that individuals diagnosed with an STI had various vulnerabilities before starting PrEP. Engagement in combination prevention services facilitated regular sexual health assessments, increased testing, awareness, and access to appropriate treatment. Consequently, the expansion of PrEP programmes might be a crucial strategy in curbing both HIV and STI transmission. Moreover, the identification of factors associated with incident and recurrent STIs among PrEP users holds promise for enhancing our understanding of transmission dynamics, which is particularly pertinent given the emergence of new biomedical prevention strategies for bacterial STIs. Few longitudinal studies have analysed incident STIs among PrEP users in Latin America. ImPrEP was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study that enrolled MSM and transgender women in the context of the public health systems in Brazil (14 sites), Mexico (four sites), and Peru (ten sites) between February, 2018, and June, 2021. The study was approved by institutional review boards at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, INI-Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; CAAE:79259517.5.1001.5262), National Institute of Public Health (Mexico City, Mexico; CI-1515), and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (Lima, Peru; 100740). Ethical approval was also obtained from the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee and local institutional review boards at each Brazilian site. All study participants provided written informed consent before enrolment in Portuguese (Brazil) or Spanish (Mexico and Peru). The study was registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, U1111-1217-6021. Eligible participants were screened and enrolled on the same day to receive daily oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg). Follow-up visits were scheduled at week 4 and quarterly (every 3 months) thereafter during the period of study, and at each visit participants were prescribed PrEP, behavioural information was collected, and further examinations were scheduled accordingly. For behavioural information, we used a recall period of 3 months for both the baseline and follow-up visits, except for CAS (recall period of 6 months at the baseline visit, and 3 months for all follow-up visits). Syphilis testing comprised a rapid  Gender was dichotomised into cisgender men and transgender women. We described age at baseline both as numerical (median [IQR]) and categorical ranges (18–24 years, 25–30 years, >30 years). Self-reported race was categorised as non-White (Asian, Black, Indigenous, or mixed-race [Pardo or Mestizo]) versus White. Schooling was stratified into primary, secondary, or post-secondary education. Post-exposure prophylaxis use 12 months before baseline was dichotomised (yes  All STI tests were done at baseline (visit 0) and every 3 months (from visit 2 onwards). Anorectal chlamydia and gonorrhoea was tested annually (visits 0, 6, and 10) until June, 2020, and at every follow-up visit (visit 2, every 3 months) thereafter. Interim visits were done if a participant presented with any adverse events, including STI-related symptoms, and treatment was provided as per the local standard of care. Additional samples for chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing could be collected based on clinical judgement and local availability, but only anorectal samples provided by the study were analysed, with results recorded at the most recent visit. This decision was based on the restricted access to molecular diagnosis in the study countries and the high rates of asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhoea at extragenital sites among MSM and transgender women, particularly anorectal. We assessed three outcomes in this analysis: prevalent bacterial STIs, incident bacterial STIs, and recurrent bacterial STIs. Prevalent bacterial STI was defined as the presence of active syphilis (titres ≥1:8 and a positive microhaemagglutination assay for  Assessment of safety and adverse events during the ImPrEP study has been described elsewhere. Baseline sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of all participants included in the analyses were described. We included all ImPrEP participants who took any bacterial STI test (syphilis or anorectal chlamydia or gonorrhoea) at enrolment in prevalence analysis, whereas only those who attended at least one follow-up visit and had been tested at least once after baseline were considered for incidence or recurrence analysis. We calculated incidence rates with 95% CIs for any bacterial STI and each STI separately, and person-years under follow-up considering time between baseline and the last visit. Bacterial STIs diagnosed at baseline were not included in the numerator of STI incidence rates. We calculated the proportion of any incident bacterial STI (syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, or anorectal gonorrhoea) per participant, and the number of times when any incident bacterial STI was diagnosed after baseline per participant. We calculated the overall STI and STI-specific incidence rates using a Poisson model with the number of person-years of follow-up as the offset. To identify factors associated with prevalent STIs, we used a log-binomial model, interpreting the results as prevalence ratios. For factors related to incident and recurrent STIs, we used a Cox regression model with time-dependent variables, where each participant was followed up from enrolment until event occurrence or censoring. As the hazards in the Cox models with time-dependent variables were no longer proportional, we investigated whether using averaged hazard ratios (HRs) was reasonable for interpreting coefficients related to the explanatory variables over the follow-up period by using the graphical diagnosis of scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Multicollinearity was evaluated using the variance inflation factor, with a threshold of 2·5. The analyses were done in two stages. Initially, we evaluated each risk factor while controlling solely for country. Factors statistically significant at the 10% level were then included in the final models, where the interpretation was made in terms of the association measures and their respective 95% CIs. Given the limited advantages of imputing outcome variable values, we did not impute missing values of the STI variable at baseline for the prevalent STI analysis. Since baseline STI was an explanatory variable in the incident and recurrent STI analyses, missing values were addressed through multiple imputation. This process used variables measured at baseline and behavioural time-dependent variables measured at each quarterly visit, generating 20 imputed datasets via the predictive mean matching method, considering the longitudinal data structure, with the 2lonly.norm command available in the Mice package of the R software. Statistical analyses were done with R (version 4.2.2). The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Among all 9509 participants included in the ImPrEP study, 8525 (89·7%) had available STI results at baseline and were included in the prevalent STI analysis (3640 [92·7%] in Brazil, 2671 [81·2%] in Mexico, and 2214 [96·6%] in Peru).

For the incident and recurrent analyses, we included 7558 (79·5%) of 9509 ImPrEP participants who had at least one STI test during follow-up visits (Brazil: 3447 [45·6%] participants; Mexico: 2486 [32·9%] participants; Peru: 1625 [21·5%] participants). 1796 (23·8%) of 7558 participants were lost to follow-up, including 69 individuals who acquired HIV before any STI was detected. Overall, 7211 (95·4%) of 7558 participants were cisgender MSM and 347 (4·6%) were travesti or transgender women, and 4230 (56·0%) were aged 30 years or younger. Those not included in the incident and recurrent STI analyses were more frequently from Mexico and Peru compared with Brazil, transgender women versus cisgender men, aged 18–24 years versus older than 24 years, and non-White versus White, and more likely to have secondary education or lower versus post-secondary education ( Participants were followed up for a total of 11 959·9 person-years after enrolment. Overall, the follow-up period ranged from 0·2 to 3·3 years, with a median follow-up of 1·6 years (IQR 0·8–2·3).

Incident bacterial STIs were higher among participants from Mexico, those aged 18–24 years, those who self-identified as non-White, those who reported previous post-exposure prophylaxis use at baseline, those who reported multiple sex partners since the last visit, those who reported receptive CAS, those who reported use of poppers, and those with previous STI diagnosis at baseline ( Recurrent bacterial STIs were higher among those aged 18–24 years, those who reported multiple sex partners since the last visit, those who reported use of poppers, and those with previous STI diagnosis at baseline ( The characteristics of participants included in incident and recurrent STI analyses were similar across countries, with some differential losses among participants with increased vulnerability to HIV or other STIs ( In this large cohort of MSM and transgender women using oral PrEP in Latin America, we found a high burden of STIs, especially among those aged 18–30 years, those with secondary education or lower, and those self-identifying as non-White. Substance use, previous post-exposure prophylaxis prescription, transactional sex, and self-reported behavioural characteristics, including high frequency of CAS and a higher number of sex partners, were associated with increased probabilities of being diagnosed with any bacterial STI at baseline, before PrEP initiation, and during follow-up, after PrEP initiation. International cohorts also reported similar factors associated with incident and recurrent bacterial STI diagnoses after PrEP initiation, including younger age, higher number of sexual partners, CAS, and substance use. Our data indicate a high concentration of bacterial STI diagnoses among a small proportion of individuals, as more than 70% of participants had no bacterial STI diagnosis during follow-up. 12% of participants accounted for 61% of all incident bacterial STIs diagnosed during the study follow-up, and recurrent STI diagnoses were more frequent among those of younger age (18–24 years), with a higher number of sex partners, and reporting poppers use. Moreover, being diagnosed with any bacterial STI at baseline posed an increased risk of incident and recurrent STIs during study follow-up. These findings might help to identify individuals in Latin America who could benefit most from biomedical technologies aiming to prevent bacterial STIs, such as the use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis. The high rates of incident and recurrent bacterial STIs are in line with the regional landscape, since Latin America faces epidemics of HIV and STIs, especially syphilis, which disproportionally burden MSM and transgender women. Additionally, the HPTN083 study, which evaluated long-acting injectable PrEP with cabotegravir among 4566 MSM and transgender women, of whom 1964 (43%) were from Latin America, also found high STI incidence (50·7 cases per 100 person-years), which was highest in Africa (75 cases per 100 person-years) and Latin America (63·9 cases per 100 person-years). Syphilis and rectal chlamydia had equal incidence rates (16·7 cases per 100 person-years), followed by rectal gonorrhoea (11 cases per 100 person-years), with few cases of urogenital chlamydia (4·5 cases per 100 person-years) or gonorrhoea (2·4 cases per 100 person-years). Similar with our data, about 60% of participants had no STI diagnosis during the study, and almost 80% of all STI diagnoses were found in only 25% of participants. Our study has several limitations. We did not collect multisite swab samples for chlamydia or gonorrhoea and tested for these infections less frequently compared with syphilis, which might have led to underestimation of chlamydia and gonorrhoea rates. We did not systematically conduct tests of cure nor systematically collect information on STI treatment. We used laboratory cure criteria as a proxy for STI resolution by comparing previous and incident bacterial STI, potentially underestimating new diagnoses. Higher proportions of participants reporting STI-related vulnerabilities (eg, younger age, non-White race, and lower education) were not included in incidence analysis, which could have underestimated incidence rates in the ImPrEP study. The HR for assessing the association between risk factors and STI incidence could be affected by selection bias due to unequal weighting of early and late HRs. Although almost a quarter of participants were lost to follow-up, this bias is mitigated by the relatively short median follow-up period of 1·6 years and similar follow-up times regardless of STI diagnosis. Self-reported data on sexual behaviour and substance use might be subject to recall bias, and our analyses could be affected by unmeasured confounders. Previous data suggest that participants from Mexico and Peru, transgender women, those identifying as non-White, those with lower education, those with fewer sex partners, those with no history of transactional sex, and those younger than 30 years have increased odds of early loss to follow-up. Our cohort is highly representative of MSM and transgender women using oral PrEP in Latin America and brings important data on prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs and their associated risk factors. Overtly, data from ImPrEP contribute to further describing the landscape of bacterial STIs among MSM and transgender women in Latin America, providing data on molecular diagnosis of STIs among these key populations in the region. In conclusion, our results add to a growing body of evidence that monitors data on STIs in Latin America, outlining the importance of age, sexual behaviour, and substance use in further understanding the dynamics of STI transmission in the region. Our findings suggest an already high vulnerability to STIs at PrEP initiation, and incidence of recurrent STIs among a specifc group of individuals as the main drivers of the high burden of bacterial STIs among people on PrEP. Therefore, the intertwining of person-centred approaches to adequately identify those more vulnerable to bacterial STIs, comprehensive sexual health assessments in PrEP programmes, and intersectional actions to tackle insufficient sex education and the burden of mental health conditions and substance use are crucial to curb the HIV and STI syndemic in Latin America.

Of 40 Klick patients audited, 4 of 5 BHIVA standards were met: 100% had documented co-medications, smoking history, blood pressure, and viral load data, and 89% received a cardiovascular risk calculation (Targets 97%-90%-90%-90%-90%). Compared to national BHIVA audit findings, Klick performed better across 22 of 24 comparable measures. Nurses safely managed a cohort comprising some complexity (eg, co-morbidities, polypharmacy); no cases were escalated off the pathway, and all were virologically suppressed. Using a digitally supported model, nurses effectively provided safe care to HIV-positive patients with predominantly stable health, enabling consultants to focus on more complex caseloads. Care was comprehensive and person-centered and obtained better outcomes compared to previous national audits.","HIV is now a manageable long-term condition for many individuals due to the availability of effective treatment. Two national audits of HIV outpatient care (2015 and 2018) conducted against the British HIV Association (BHIVA) annual monitoring guidance provide a measure of whether national services deliver effective, comprehensive, and holistic HIV care. Our HIV outpatient service at Chelsea and Westminster Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CWFT), London faced local challenges providing further rationale for implementing change and adapting our outpatient model. From an operational and staffing perspective most patients were seen face-to-face, by a consultant physician, with short appointments (20 minutes). Patients scheduled appointments via a call center or while attending clinic, and consultant waiting times were lengthy (up to 6 months). Specialist/senior nurses (Band 7 or 8, Agenda for Change) can conduct routine and complex HIV consultations; however, a minority of consultations in our service were seen by this level of nursing. Harnessing developments in digital technology and alternative models of care have the potential to address the national and local challenges stated above. A nurse-led, digitally supported model of care, called Klick, was therefore developed and implemented at CWFT Kobler and Dean Street HIV outpatient clinics. Klick was co-designed by patients and clinicians to support PLWH to manage their healthcare, navigate access to the clinic, and communicate with their multidisciplinary team, while also ensuring the service provides comprehensive and holistic care, in keeping with BHIVA guidelines. The model incorporated a structured training framework, to enable Band 6 nurses to remotely deliver care, which included an “annual review,” for patients with stable health. The technology underpinning Klick included a patient app and clinician-facing portal, HealthMachine™ (Avegen). The aim of this report is to evaluate the nurse-led, digitally supported pathway of care by reviewing the clinical care outcomes, nursing staff perspectives, and operational service changes after Klick's implementation. Klick was conceptually created in 2017 during a HIV innovation sprint, funded by ViiV Healthcare. A short proof-of-concept pilot was conducted in 2018 at Kobler clinic, involving 92 patients, and demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, good care outcomes, and service efficiencies. A mixed-methods, qualitative, and quantitative analysis was conducted to evaluate Klick after its full implementation. This involved an audit of care among PLWH who had experienced nurse-led consultations via Klick (2022) with comparison to the national audit, one-to-one interviews with the Klick nursing team to gain acceptability insights (2023), and a descriptive comparison of pre- and postimplementation service operational metrics. The ASSESS tool ( The Klick app allows PLWH to:
 Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments (blood tests, nurse HIV review consultations, and ART injectable treatment/consultations). Scheduling was supported by appointment reminders or notifications to prompt the booking of a future appointment. By accessing nurse-review appointments, patients receive a comprehensive virtual annual review. These are available to PLWH self-selecting as having stable health. Those who are acutely unwell, have complex health needs, or are virologically detectable are encouraged to book a senior doctor appointment via the call center. Complete and submit previsit questionnaires (PVQ) ≤ 10 days before an upcoming nurse-review appointment. PLWH use the PVQ to influence discussion points during the consultation, state their preferred mode of consultation (in-person or telephone), and provide the information required for annual review (eg, smoking status). View results for all routine blood tests and accompanying clinical advice. Receive verifiable care notifications from the clinic. Request emergency oral medication prescription. Review the PVQ while preparing for clinic—to triage, anticipate, or address care needs. Document the consultation on a medical proforma that aligns with BHIVA HIV monitoring guidelines ( Dispatch general practitioner (GP) letters, automatically generated from the medical proforma. Export documentation to CWFT's electronic patient record system (EPR). Review and release routine test results using a red-amber-green rating to the app, with canned text contextualizing results and providing additional advice/recommendations ( Send push notifications to the app either individually (personalized care message) or en masse (circulating service updates). Example of the medical proforma output following a nurse-led consultation. Example of laboratory results view in the patient portal application. Each Klick nurse is allocated a consultant supervisor, with whom they discuss their clinic list at pre and postclinic meetings to agree on a management plan and obtain prescriptions. Nurses conduct their clinics alongside a consultant-led team. If required (eg, patient is acutely unwell) cases can be discussed with, or escalated to be seen by, the consultant in charge on the day. Nurses aim to obtain accredited (National HIV Nursing Association) NHIVNA/STI Foundation competencies and certifications during their clinical practice, supported by the virtual learning environment provided within the national program. Onboarding to register and use the Klick app is voluntary so patients have the option to use the Klick pathway or access the outpatient service via the historic (mainstream) processes outlined above. Thus, they can use either pathway exclusively or a blend of both pathways according to their preference and self-perceived needs. Using the clinician portal and CWFT EPR, the records of 40 Kobler patients who received care via Klick nurse-review clinics between 25 July 2022 and 8 August 2022 were reviewed, by a consultant physician. Audit standards included documentation within the previous 15 months of routine blood tests, vital signs, co-morbidities, co-medications, adherence to ART, sexual and reproductive health history, mental health and cognitive status, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and bone fracture risk profiles, vaccine uptake, and last HIV viral load measurements performed within 9 months. Results were compared with BHIVA HIV monitoring targets and the 2018 BHIVA national audit outcomes that involved 40 PLWH aged ≥50 years. BHIVA's key auditable targets were: 97% on ART should have all current co-medications recorded ≤15 months, 90% PLWH have HIV viral load measured ≤9 months, 90% individuals aged ≥40 years have a 10-year CVD risk calculated ≤3 years, 90% PLWH have a smoking history documented ≤2 years, and 90% have had their blood pressure recorded ≤15 months. Semistructured, in-depth video interviews were conducted with Klick nurses from both clinics to provide qualitative insights about the acceptability but also the effectiveness and impact of Klick. Interviews were 45 minutes duration, held between October 2022 and June 2023 and conducted by 2 consultants from an independent innovations consultancy (TCC Health). Analysis followed thematic synthesis. Using a theoretical framework of acceptability, themes comprised: affective attitude, ethicality, opportunity costs, perceived effectiveness, and self-efficacy. Appointment attendance rates (during the auditable period) were calculated at Kobler clinic: Klick-booked junior nurse-review appointments were compared to doctor/senior nurse appointments booked using the mainstream/historic processes. The waiting times for the first available consultant appointments booked via mainstream processes were collected also. Ethics approval was deemed not to be required by the CWFT research department because the audit, interviews, and service metrics captured were conducted only for service evaluation and not for research purposes. Informed consent was obtained verbally for interview participation to evaluate the Klick service. The consent was provided in the presence of an independent witness. Between August 2020 and April 2024, 5859 patients had registered to use Klick and 2509 (43%) actively used the app in April 2024, representing >57% of the combined Kobler and Dean Street clinic cohorts. At the time of the audit period August 2022, 1629 Kobler clinic patients had registered for Klick, and 571 had used the app during that month. Of 40 audited patients, the median age was 52 years (range, 29-85), 10% (4 of 40) were female, all were virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <20 copies/mL), and the median CD4+ count was 740 cells/mm All patients (40 of 40) had documented co-medications, smoking history, blood pressure, and viral load data recorded, meeting the BHIVA monitoring targets (97%, 90%, 90%, and 90%, respectively;  Klick clinical audit results for (A) the 5 key BHIVA HIV monitoring targets and (B) all metrics assessed.

Co-morbidities, metabolic parameters, hepatitis status, ART adherence, CD4+ count, vaccine status, sexual and reproductive health, substance and alcohol misuse, bone health, cognition, and mental health measures captured are shown in  Compared to the 2018 UK national audit results ( Results from the Klick audit compared with a national audit conducted in 2018. BMI, body mass index; GP, general practitioner; STI, sexually transmitted infection; VL, viral load.  Eighty-five percent (34 of 40) of PLWH had ≥1 co-morbidities and 71% had ≥2 (24 of 34). These included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, CVD, anxiety/depression, osteoporosis, and obesity. Moreover, 68% (27 of 40) of patients reported polypharmacy (≥2 non-ART medications). No patients were virologically detectable or required escalation to see a consultant. Eight (20%) patients had treatment-switch discussions, with 6 (15%) switching and 2 (5%) declining to switch. Furthermore, 15 of 40 drug–drug interactions (DDIs) were suspected: 11 had been previously documented and actioned; 2 new DDIs were identified and actioned appropriately by the nurse; 2 DDIs were noted by the auditor but were not documented—these were minor and needed no action. All Klick nurses were invited to interview. Seven verbally consented and were interviewed: 4 of 5 from Kobler clinic and 3 of 3 from Dean Street. Nurses expressed positivity to Klick-enabled care across the 5 domains of acceptability suggesting that Klick is a well-adopted solution.  Domain Descriptions for Acceptability and Nurse Quotes. BHIVA, British HIV Association; GP, general practitioner. Nurses were largely positive about all Klick pathway features and found them effective. They reported most patients complete the PVQ and responses were useful for clinic preparation. The digital communication tools helped reduce outgoing calls or letter dictation. Nurses expressed high satisfaction with the results feature and reported the functionality to be user-friendly. To optimize efficiencies and patient experience nurses suggested integrating the medical proforma and PVQ, adapting both documents to increase personalization, improved automation of results, and provision of more appointment types to respond to the diversity of patient needs. Nurses reported that most patients find Klick beneficial but some may use Klick as a de facto way of engaging with the service, rather than for accessing the specific/intended services offered by Klick. They felt that the Klick service was appropriate for all patient types and identified a need for intervention/activities to encourage uptake in patient populations who may typically avoid digitally enabled services and/or interact with the clinical team with lower frequency than the population as a whole. Nurses felt the onboarding process was structured. They reported managing some complex patients but feeling confident and supported to do so. Nurse-reported findings between Kobler clinic and Dean Street clinics were broadly similar with some variation attributable to underlining service characteristics, that is, more junior nurse-led clinics at Kobler, whereas Dean Street focused on efficiency of appointment utilization. Eight nurses have received Klick training at the Kobler clinic to date, and during August 2022, 5 Band 6 nurses were conducting 7 to 8 clinics/week. The mean waiting time to see a Kobler consultant was 18 weeks pre-Klick in 2019 to 8 weeks post-Klick in August 2022 and these appointments had also extended from 20 to 30 minutes/patient, respectively. During the audited period, 10% (8 of 83) of Klick patients did not attend or respond to telephone contact (DNA) at their scheduled nurse-review appointed time. This compares with 17% (153 of 904) who had booked their appointment with a doctor/senior nurse via mainstream methods, equating to a 41% reduction in DNA rates among the Klick pathway ( Klick Registrations and App Usage by Kobler Patients and a Comparison of Attendance Rates Among Patients With Scheduled Klick Appointments Versus Mainstream Appointments. UK HIV services face several challenges. The growing and aging HIV-positive population incurs increased care costs due to co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and higher proportions taking ART. Effective and novel strategies are required to ensure that cost-efficient HIV care provided by a suitably skilled workforce can be sustained in this climate. Utilizing nursing professionals or other multidisciplinary team members represents one potential solution. Both BHIVA standards of care and the Select Commons Committee report on HIV/AIDS in the UK have endorsed and recommended the adoption of more nurse-led clinics. The Klick outpatient model aimed to amplify the role and contribution made by the HIV nursing team. This report showed they provided comprehensive clinical care during their consultations, achieving 4 of 5 BHIVA targets and demonstrated excellent performance compared to the standard-of-care provided by doctors and nurses in outpatient HIV services nationally. The Klick nurses managed primarily medically stable patients but also some with complex needs under the supervision of a consultant: Klick patients self-certified as “medically stable” but most had polypharmacy, several required ART switches, and 85% had ≥1 co-morbidity, a higher proportion than reported in the national audit (29%), all of which demonstrate a level of complexity. Piercy et al assessed the specific contributions of HIV care delivered by specialist nurses and our findings provide evidence that more junior nurses provided similar contributions. The digital components of Klick were perceived by nurses to be effective and impactful to patients and staff. The PVQ was used to capture annual review monitoring requirements and anticipate and/or triage care needs, minimizing the number of on-the-day escalations to the consultant. The medical proforma likely contributed to the further completeness of audit data collected and intervention offer rates. Prepopulated proforma, canned text for results provision, and autogeneration of GP letters helped minimize the clinic-associated administration burden. The evaluation findings suggest the Band 6 nurses were able to participate in a supported, training and development pathway that led to them developing the requisite clinical skills to manage their own cohort of medically stable patients and structure how aspects of care were delivered in the clinic. This resulted in job satisfaction and a degree of professional autonomy, and they were able to work toward and complete national qualifications during their weekly clinics. They found utility in the training features incorporated within the clinician portal, reported confidence in managing their own patient cohort, and felt well supported by the consultant-led team when seeing patients with more complex needs. The team were invested to further optimize the pathway, proposing opportunities to enhance the service for patients and staff. These are all factors that help bolster morale, improve staff retention and promotion prospects, and strengthen relationships with patients and clinical colleagues, all features that have been difficult to quantify for this report. Although cost-benefit was not a primary objective in the design of Klick, the model likely contributed to alleviating resource and capacity pressures, by delivering additional Kobler clinics and securely providing results for all blood appointments booked online. A reduction in waiting times and extension of appointment length was observed for consultant clinics in 2022, despite no growth in Kobler consultant establishment since 2020 and an increase in the cohort size of both clinics. This suggests consultants can spend longer seeing patients with more complex/urgent healthcare needs in a timelier manner. Patient engagement rates were 41% higher for Klick-booked appointments compared to mainstream booking processes, which is likely a result of allowing patients to directly book/reschedule their appointments online. Klick technology proved advantageous during the COVID-19 pandemic because Klick staff could rapidly adapt to conducting consultations and communicating with patients remotely. The evaluation had a number of limitations. The experience and engagement of PLWH have not been reported because this has been submitted for publication separately. The clinical audit involved small numbers and was not conducted at Dean Street because the site only launched with Klick less than 12 months before the audit, and staff did not initially use the Klick medical proforma. We plan to re-audit Klick-registered versus Klick-unregistered PLWH at both sites in due course. Pre-Klick service metric data was available only for Kobler clinic because of the research carried out during the sprint design and pilot evaluation, therefore Dean Street service metrics have not been presented. Other factors that could potentially have contributed to the changes in operational metrics observed at Kobler clinic have not been reported (eg, clinics provided by other multidisciplinary team members, service adaptations during the pandemic, recommended frequency intervals of appointments/year). This report showed that by adopting a nurse-led, digitally assisted model of care the service has demonstrated improvements in the delivery of comprehensive, holistic patient-centered care and supported the mobilization and upskilling of a junior nursing workforce to manage PLWH with stable health. Service pressures have eased since launch with consultants being able to prioritize care for patients with more complex healthcare needs. The Klick model has been rolled out at 2 further CWFT HIV outpatient sites (October 2023 and March 2024). Using similar models of care in other large HIV outpatient settings has the potential to support the UK's commitment to eliminating HIV as a public health problem and enhance the experience of both PLWH and the outpatient multidisciplinary team that serves them.","['HIV', 'mobile app', 'nurse-led', 'care model', 'outpatients']",2024-9-19,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11440292,"Mpox and Vaccine Knowledge, Beliefs, and Sources of Trusted Information Among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men in the U.S.","Racial/ethnic and regional disparities in mpox awareness highlight the needs for tailored public health interventions and communication campaigns. Several misconceptions and knowledge gaps exist related to mpox transmission and vaccination recommendations. Twelve of 13 individuals who did not trust conventional sources of health information did not get vaccinated for mpox. Existing health services and networks may improve mpox awareness and vaccination uptake. This research aims to characterize disparities in mpox- and vaccine-related knowledge in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in the U.S. The authors conducted a study using the American Men's Internet Survey, which includes 823 cisgender (defined as their gender identity matching their sex assigned at birth) males aged ≥15 years from August 5 to 15, 2022. The authors evaluated sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with mpox knowledge, including race/ethnicity, region, age group, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis use using chi-square tests. The authors identified knowledge gaps, with many participants unsure about whether individuals need 2 doses of the vaccine (34.4%) and whether the vaccine confers immediate protection (27.2%). The authors observed racial and regional disparities ( Findings suggest the potential to leverage existing networks (i.e., sexually transmitted infection or general health care services with pre-exposure prophylaxis use) for future targeted health service programming or education campaigns for mpox vaccination among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.","Human mpox virus is an orthopoxvirus that was first identified in humans in the 1970s during smallpox eradication campaigns in Africa. Mpox was previously primarily zoonotic in transmission, The first case of mpox in the 2022–2023 U.S. outbreak was reported on May 17, 2022. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) were disproportionately affected in the 2022 mpox pandemic. The U.S. federal government launched a comprehensive response and research plan to the outbreak, The U.S. Monkeypox Research Priorities were released in July 2022 and identified outstanding research questions, objectives, and investigations that, if addressed, would provide critical, real-time data to inform U.S. outbreak response operations, communications, and implementation. In the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak, people most affected by mpox may not have had complete information about the disease or may have been exposed to misinformation. The American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS) mpox substudy was a 1-time, self-administered online survey conducted from August 5 to 15, 2022 to assess the knowledge, behaviors, and experiences related to mpox and vaccination perceptions and behaviors among GBMSM in the U.S. and was developed because of the global mpox outbreak. This survey was developed by Emory University in collaboration with the CDC and Johns Hopkins University as an associated substudy of the AMIS-2021 survey. The mpox substudy included men aged ≥15 years living in the U.S. who had previously participated in the AMIS-2021 survey. The AMIS mpox substudy sampling frame included all individuals who completed AMIS-2021, had anal or oral sex with a man in the past 12 months, and consented to be recontacted about future research studies (N=2,999). Survey eligibility criteria were verified for all respondents to the AMIS mpox substudy. Methods for the annual AMIS survey have been previously described. All potential individuals for the substudy received an email invitation to complete the survey on August 4, 2022 and, if they did not complete the survey, were sent a reminder on August 11, 2022. All participants provided electronic informed consent after eligibility screening and could stop their participation in the survey at any time. Participants were not compensated. Participants could complete the mpox substudy using a secured uniform resource locator on any device. The survey was available in English, and the median completion time for the survey was 17.3 minutes. The survey contained several modules, including demographics, mpox vaccine history, sexual behavior, substance use, HIV testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and diagnoses, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), recent symptoms, mpox testing, mpox diagnosis, and experiences of stigma. All mpox-related questions were developed owing to the mpox pandemic and were not included in prior AMIS surveys. To measure awareness of mpox, the authors used a single item 4-point Likert scale that asked how much participants had seen, read, or heard about mpox. The authors then used 9 items to measure mpox-related beliefs or knowledge. Each item contained a statement about mpox, with Likert-like responses ( The authors also included a single question to assess trusted sources of information about mpox: What sources would you trust for accurate information about monkeypox? Response options included health care providers, state or local public health officials, health information websites, the CDC, WHO, social media, dating apps, news media, or none of these. Participants could select multiple responses. The data reported in this subsurvey were analyzed using Stata, Version 16.1. The authors summarized unstratified measures of the mpox-related vaccine and transmission beliefs and knowledge items. The authors then summarized the distribution of trusted sources of health information and evaluated the most common responses by racial/ethnic groups. This study was reviewed and approved by the Emory University IRB. This activity was also reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. AMIS data are shared with the CDC and Johns Hopkins University through contractual data sharing agreements. The data in this substudy are not publicly available to protect individual confidentiality. The response rate among AMIS-2021 cycle participants who provided email addresses for future study contacts was 27.5% (824 of 2,999). After enrollment for the survey was completed, data were reviewed and assessed to ensure data reliability. The authors further removed 1 individual from analysis who reported never hearing about mpox to result in a total analytical sample of 823 individuals. Overall, 44.0% (362 of 823) of participants reported high awareness (they had seen, heard, or read a lot) about mpox, and 16.1% ( Level of Mpox Awareness Among U.S. Men Who Have Sex With Men, August 2022 — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis; STI, sexually transmitted infection. More than 25% of individuals indicated that they did not know or were unsure about many of the statements related to mpox ( Knowledge About Mpox and Vaccination by Percentage Agreement Among U.S. Men Who Have Sex With Men, August 2022 The most endorsed sources of trusted information included individual's doctors or health care providers (89.8%,  Sources of Trusted Health Information About Mpox Among U.S. Men Who Have Sex With Men by Race/Ethnicity, August 2022 Participant may select multiple sources or that they did not trust any of them. The key objective in these analyses was to identify awareness or knowledge gaps about mpox vaccination among a nationwide sample of U.S. GBMSM to inform ongoing programmatic efforts and research priorities at that time. Prior research suggested that the lowest rates of mpox vaccination were in rural areas, particularly in the South and Midwest, particularly among Black GBMSM than among other race groups. The authors’ finding of greater mpox awareness among GBMSM who reported HIV PrEP use could be attributed to mpox testing and vaccine clinics also providing other sexual health services. This may speak to the utility of this approach and builds on previous studies showing that men who use HIV PrEP may be more likely to have testing and treatment for STIs. Gaps in awareness and knowledge about mpox and vaccination are likely to make future epidemic control more challenging. Given the disparities in uptake of mpox-related interventions, it is also critical for public health programs to adapt and translate emerging science into actionable messaging, interventions, and programs. An earlier report from authors’ study noted changes in behavior after identification of mpox, with approximately 50% of GBMSM reporting reductions in their number of sexual partners and/or hookups owing to community mpox infections. The authors found knowledge gaps regarding transmission risk such as use of condoms or clothes to prevent transmission or risk of transmission through saliva or semen. In addition, the authors found knowledge gaps about effectiveness of vaccination, such as when protection is conferred or the number of doses necessary for protection. These findings suggest a critical need to focus further research and community education efforts, particularly among populations with the lowest levels of awareness or knowledge related to mpox early in the public health response in future outbreak settings. Ultimately, beliefs and perceived knowledge about transmission may inform individual's decisions to engage in behaviors. Specifically, incorrectly thinking that prevention strategies could work (when they do not), such as using condoms to prevent transmission, produces a different challenge compared with believing that vaccines do not work (when they can). This information, coupled with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices review of mpox vaccine efficacy and recommendation to add the JYNNEOS vaccine schedule for individuals susceptible to mpox acquisition, Regarding trusted information sources, there were few participants who indicated no sources of trusted information. Given widespread trust in providers and public health officials/agencies, collaboration is critical, especially with local health departments and providers serving GBMSM (and other) individuals. Community engagement and partnerships can enhance the messages and channels for distribution. In summary, the federal mpox research and response plan explicitly worked to avoid stigmatizing language and take a harm-reduction approach to prevention strategies in vaccination, In addition to the promotion of nonstigmatizing sex-positive language regarding behavioral interventions, programs can address inequities across racial/ethnic groups and regionally in access to messaging, testing, prevention services, and treatment. Importantly, working toward equity in vaccine coverage is central to the mitigation of mpox-related health effects. Because there are global decreases in mpox incidence yet continued transmission This study sample is a convenience sample and is subject to self-selection bias, which has resulted in an GBMSM sample that skews older and more non-Hispanic White than the general U.S. male population, which limits overall generalizability to the entire GBMSM population in the U.S. The authors recognize that the response rate for the survey was 27.5%, which is relatively low. The nonresponse could bias the results because individuals who responded to the substudy may have been more connected or aware of mpox than the general population. Given this sample, participants may have been more likely to be more aware of mpox and more likely to trust traditional sources of health information such as care providers, public health officials, and government/multilateral agencies. In addition, because the data were self-reported, there could have been misinterpretation of some of the questions or more positive responses owing to social desirability. The timing of data collection from early to mid-August 2022 reflects a particular point in time, and results may not be applicable to current ongoing mpox prevention efforts. Mpox quickly became a public health concern in 2022 among many individuals throughout the US, particularly GBMSM. After developing a rapid-response survey to study mpox through AMIS from August 5 to 15, 2022, the authors identified several knowledge gaps in GBMSM, ranging from the number of necessary doses of the mpox vaccine and how quickly it confers resistance to infection. The authors observed racial and regional disparities, with a greater proportion of non-Hispanic Black men and men living in the South reporting little to no mpox awareness than other groups. In addition, the authors found that among HIV-negative participants, people who used PrEP within the past year were more likely to exhibit high awareness about mpox than people who did not use PrEP. In addition, the authors found that individuals who did not trust the listed sources of health information were unlikely to become vaccinated for mpox, posing potential barriers to reach full community vaccine coverage. Regardless, the authors conclude that integrating mpox services into existing social services and health delivery networks (i.e., STI care or general health care services) is essential for future mpox health education, combatting misinformation, and improving service delivery and vaccine efforts.","['Mpox', 'GBMSM', 'vaccine', 'knowledge', 'disparities', 'misconceptions']",2024-8-22,AJPM Focus,"""sexually transmitted infection"""
11469534,Sore Throat to Still’s: Group A Streptococcus Causing Adult-Onset Still’s Disease,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare hyper-inflammatory disease with poorly understood etiology, often presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, inflammatory polyarthralgia, transient salmon-pink maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. We are presenting an unusual case of AOSD triggered by Group A streptococci (GAS) throat infection. We report the case of a 37-year-old male with no significant medical history admitted to medicine service after three emergency room (ER) visits. Our patient had a confirmed GAS throat infection and initially met the Jones criteria. However, further testing revealed significantly high inflammatory markers, clinically evident symmetrical synovitis in wrists and left knee, and widespread lymphadenopathy with worsening maculopapular rash. Given this, he met the Yamaguchi criteria, resulting in a diagnosis of AOSD. Group A Streptococcus infections are usually linked to acute rheumatic fever (ARF), but in our case, we believe GAS infection triggered the cascade of inflammatory responses resulting in AOSD. The patient received treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and high-dose steroids with a resolution of arthralgia, down-trending ferritin, and clinical improvement in a skin rash. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first case of GAS-triggered AOSD, highlighting the need to uncover atypical causes for AOSD and warranting the need to investigate triggers for AOSD.","Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an uncommon systemic autoimmune disorder with poorly understood etiology and often is a diagnosis of exclusion that contributes to delay in diagnosis, so it is crucial to have a clear diagnostic flow [ A 37-year-old Ecuadorian male with no known medical history was initially evaluated in the ER on day three after his symptoms started for a pruritic rash on his upper back and left lower abdomen. During the first ER visit, there were concerns about shingles or insect bites; the patient was discharged from the ED after a dose of diphenhydramine with hydrocortisone 1% topical cream because of a localized allergic reaction. The patient had an insidious onset of arthralgias one to two weeks after the initial ER visit with subjective fevers and persistent rash; all the symptoms were getting worse. The patient later returned to the ER on day 62 with complaints of flu-like symptoms, intense joint pains, intermittent subjective fever, and chills with a persistent rash on the chest. The patient was found to have a febrile temperature of 38.7°C in triage with tachycardia of 107 beats per minute (bpm). His lab reports were significant for a positive throat swab for GAS, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,000 cells/μL, AST of 43 IU/L, and ALT of 87 IU/L. His chest X-ray was negative for acute pathology. The patient was treated with clindamycin 900 mg IV and discharged from the ER with a diagnosis of GAS throat infection and was prescribed a short course of oral clindamycin. The patient returned to the ER a few days later, on day 69, with persistent but worsening sore throat, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and intermittent fever. He was febrile in the ER with a temperature of 38.8 °C and tachycardia of 112 bpm. The patient denied any recent travels or hiking. His labs were significant for elevated WBC of 19,900 cells/μL, AST of 58 IU/L, ALT of 149 IU/L, nonreactive HIV antigen-antibody, lactic acidosis of 4.5 mmol/L, CRP of 232 mg/L, ESR of 96 mm/hr. Sepsis protocol was initiated, and the patient received weight-based fluid resuscitation, received intramuscular penicillin G injection 1.2 million units with a stat dose of vancomycin 1,500 mg, with minimal symptomatic relief. A CT scan of the neck with IV contrast was normal; the patient was discharged from the ED the same day and recommended to follow up with a primary care provider (PCP). However, the patient returned to the ED on day 72 with a worsening rash (Figure  The patient denied any sick contacts and was admitted to the medicine service with suspicion of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) secondary to GAS.

Reports of AST of 460 IU/L/ALT of 847 IU/L and ultrasound of the abdomen showed diffuse hepatic steatosis with a nonreactive viral hepatitis panel for hepatitis A, B, and C. During the initial days of admission, the patient complained of migratory arthralgia in the bilateral wrist, right shoulder, right knee, and left ankle with redness or swelling of affected joints. X-ray imaging of affected joints showed no acute pathology; a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis done with contrast was notable for bilateral atelectasis. no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy were noted. Antistreptolysin-O and anti-Dnase titles were found to be in normal ranges. We considered several differential diagnoses, focusing mainly on infection mimics such as ARF due to the overlap in symptoms with AOSD. Other mimics, like infections, including viral as well as bacterial, were ruled out as per infectious diseases consult. Hematology was consulted and recommended that his symptoms and labs were consistent with inflammatory syndrome rather than malignancy. On day 75, naproxen 500 mg twice daily was started; during the days following appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) dosing, arthralgia resolved on day 78. The patient had symptomatic relief; however, he did have a persistent rash and worsening liver function and was found to have hyperferritinemia of 88,000 ng/mL and an IL-2 level of 13,277 pg/mL. The patient met the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD, including arthralgia for more than two weeks, typical rash, a WBC count of more than 10,000 cells/μL, sore throat, and abnormal liver enzymes, with GAS being the suspected triggering factor. Figure  PO: per oral; QD: four times a day Clinical exam and hyperferritinemia of 92,999 ng/mL were suggestive of severe systemic inflammation and organ involvement-liver, associated with AOSD, hence, three days of methylprednisone 1,000 mg was given from day 83 till day 85, resulting in quick resolution of symptoms, followed by slow tapering, high dose steroids during the inpatient stay. One mg/kg oral prednisone was used due to the persistence of severe symptoms or organ involvement, significantly elevated inflammatory markers as listed in Table  WBC: white blood count; NA: not available; GAS: Group A  AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug CRP: C-reactive protein; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug A skin biopsy was done, and it showed perivascular dermatitis with extravasated erythrocytes and rare eosinophils and neutrophils. The patient was discharged on day 91 after an extended inpatient stay on oral prednisone 60 mg daily. The patient was seen in an outpatient setting on day 99 and found to have a resolving rash on physical examination and a further downtrend in inflammatory markers; the patient was continued on prednisone 60 mg four times a day (QD). Following the clinic visit on day 114, the patient was tolerating slow tapering of steroids and was noted to have decreased left knee effusion; however, the patient reported bilateral knee pain and left elbow pain. The patient was started on methotrexate 7.5 mg and prednisone was tapered down to 50 mg QD. Methotrexate is typically initiated at 15-25 mg/week in autoimmune diseases like AOSD. We started with 7.5 mg as there were concerns about liver function (elevated liver enzymes) but it was increased to 15 mg/week on the next follow-up visit after blood showed normalization of liver function. We tapered steroids along with starting methotrexate, hence, to achieve disease control with the tapering and eventual discontinuation of steroids, we transitioned the patient to steroid-sparing agent methotrexate. Table  Adult-onset Still's disease is a rare clinical entity. Due to the lack of definitive diagnostic tests, diagnosing AOSD is challenging, and clinical criteria hold an essential place in diagnosing this life-threatening condition. Yamaguchi criteria is widely used in diagnosing AOSD; major criteria include fever of at least 39°C for at least one week, arthralgia or arthritis for at least two weeks, non-pruritic salmon-colored rash on the trunk/extremities, granulocytic leukocytosis (10,000/mL or greater), and minor criteria are sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, and negative in tests for rheumatoid factor (RF) and ANA. [ Though our patient had three ED visits for on and off subjective fevers, sore throat, non-resolving rash, and worsening migratory polyarthralgia, he was admitted to the medicine floor after eight weeks of initial clinical presentation, therefore, having high clinical suspicion is crucial to prevent delayed or misdiagnosis. Presentation of AOSD is often found to be very similar to other systemic diseases [ The proposed mechanism for AOSD is similar to other autoimmune diseases, likely secondary to various triggers in genetically predisposed individuals [ Given widespread microbial and non-microbial triggers, there is growing evidence that infections could cause these rare disorders. Due to the growing incidence of these infections, investing resources to study the agents inducing inflammatory responses resulting in autoimmunity is appropriate. Although it is well known that GAS pharyngitis patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent ARF and eradicate GAS carriage, patients who have had ARF benefit from long-term antibiotics in terms of preventing recurrences and severity of ARF in subsequent attacks [ Our case report highlights the difficulty with diagnosing AOSD. As this is a clinical diagnosis, the most commonly used is the Yamaguchi criteria. However, these criteria have high sensitivity but very low specificity, so high clinician suspicion aided by diagnostic criteria and blood work can help diagnose these inflammatory syndromes. Along with diagnosing the disease, understanding the etiology would push clinicians to suspect these rare pathologies. Multiple authors have reported cases in the literature to identify various triggering factors. The case we are reporting is to isolate GAS as one of the etiologies for AOSD, although further epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the genuine associated risk with these triggers.","['adult-onset acute rheumatic fever', 'adult-onset still’s disease', 'autoinflammatory disease', 'group a β hemolytic streptococci', 'hyperferritinemia']",,Cureus,"""chlamydia"""

Se ha realizado un estudio descriptivo retrospectivo, analizando las historias clínicas de los pacientes diagnosticados de HII en los últimos ocho años, desde enero de 2016 hasta diciembre de 2023, en la consulta de neuropediatría de un hospital de tercer nivel. En el presente estudio se analizaron las siguientes variables en relación con la HII: datos epidemiológicos (edad en el momento del diagnóstico y sexo), manifestaciones clínicas en el momento del inicio, antecedentes personales de interés –obesidad, lupus, tratamiento con hormona del crecimiento (GH), insuficiencia suprarrenal, hipoparatiroidismo…–, toma de medicación habitual, presión de apertura del LCR (consideramos patológica una presión de apertura >25 cmH En los últimos ocho años se obtuvo un total de 14 pacientes en edad pediátrica, media de edad de 9,14 años (3-13 años), con un predominio de mujeres (57,2%). En cuanto a los antecedentes personales, la mayoría no presentaba antecedentes de interés. Todos ellos referían un desarrollo psicomotor acorde a su edad y tan sólo el 21,4% de la muestra presentaba obesidad. Otros antecedentes asociados han sido tratamiento corticoide prolongado (desencadenada al inicio de la pauta de descenso del tratamiento), tratamiento con GH por talla baja, etc. No se han encontrado enfermedades autoinmunitarias ni anomalías venosas cerebrales y, como hallazgo causal, se ha evidenciado malformación de Arnold-Chiari en uno de los pacientes. El motivo de consulta principal fue una cefalea subaguda, presente en el 71,4% de los casos, de características opresivas sin sonofobia ni fotofobia acompañante en la mayoría de ellos. Otros motivos de consulta fueron edema de papila, evidenciado de forma casual en una exploración oftalmológica rutinaria (28,5%), y disminución de la agudeza visual (21,4%). La exploración física en todos los casos fue normal, salvo en uno de ellos que presentaba paresia del VI par craneal derecho.

En el 71,4% de los pacientes no se evidenció patología, un paciente presentaba malformación de Arnold-Chiari I y los tres pacientes restantes mostraron hallazgos inespecíficos (pequeño cavernoma, sinusitis maxilar y otomastoiditis bilateral). En un caso se solicitó también una angiotomografía computarizada cerebral, que fue normal. Otras pruebas complementarias solicitadas fueron un electroencefalograma y una tomografía de coherencia óptica, que se llevó a cabo en 11/14 pacientes y fue patológica en nueve de ellos. El principal hallazgo fue un aumento del grosor de las capas de fibras nerviosas. En todos los casos se ha realizado un estudio analítico completo, con hemograma, bioquímica y coagulación, además de perfil férrico, hormonas tiroideas, autoinmunidad y serologías infecciosas (entre ellas  Tras la primera punción lumbar, los síntomas se aliviaron en un 71,4% de los casos (a las 24-30 horas mejoró sustancialmente la cefalea, y a los pocos días, la agudeza visual); sin embargo, cuatro pacientes requirieron varias punciones evacuadoras. Tan sólo uno de ellos presentó una evolución tórpida. A los 40 días precisó una válvula de derivación ventriculoperitoneal con mejoría inicial, y permaneció asintomático con una resonancia magnética cerebral aparentemente normal y sin secuelas visuales (campimetría visual normal). Un año después, reapareció la cefalea de predominio posterior de intensidad moderada, sin vómitos y con sensación de visión borrosa. Se repitió la resonancia magnética cerebral y se evidenció una malformación de Arnold-Chiari y una leve siringomielia cervical alta, que podrían justificar el cuadro clínico, y se decidió una intervención quirúrgica.

Debe realizarse una valoración oftalmológica, en la que el hallazgo más específico es la presencia de papiledema (bilateral habitualmente), que es el principal predictor de pérdida visual. Cabe destacar la importancia de realizar una tomografía de coherencia óptica para monitorizar tanto la progresión de la enfermedad como la eficacia del tratamiento [ En cuanto a las pruebas de neuroimagen, se considera de elección la resonancia magnética cerebral [ A través de la punción lumbar estudiaremos tanto la composición del LCR (que debe ser normal en la HII) como la medición de la presión de su salida. En el caso de lactantes, al presentar la fontanela abierta, no hay consenso unánime sobre la cifra de presión intracraneal que se considera normal [ Los principales objetivos del tratamiento son disminuir la presión intracraneal, mejorar la sintomatología y prevenir la principal complicación de estos pacientes, el deterioro visual por atrofia del nervio óptico. En los pacientes con sobrepeso u obesidad es importante incidir en la pérdida de peso, junto con una dieta restrictiva en sodio. En el paciente de nuestra muestra en el que la HII se asociaba al tratamiento con GH, se suspendió el tratamiento con resolución completa de la clínica. El tratamiento médico de primera línea utilizado en la población pediátrica es la acetazolamida, un inhibidor de la anhidrasa carbónica que disminuye la producción de LCR. Otras alternativas terapéuticas son el topiramato (más utilizado en población adulta) o la furosemida, asociados o no a acetazolamida. En ocasiones, si en el momento del diagnóstico la afectación visual es grave, pueden utilizarse ciclos cortos de prednisona o metilprednisolona, sin olvidar que tanto el tratamiento prolongado con corticoides como su retirada brusca puede favorecer el desarrollo de HII. En nuestra serie, en el 36% de los casos, la clínica se autolimitó, sin precisar ningún tipo de tratamiento; sin embargo, en el 57% de los casos se instauró tratamiento con acetazolamida con buena respuesta (en tres casos ha sido preciso añadir furosemida, y en un paciente, un ciclo corto de corticoterapia). Como última opción terapéutica, está descrita la fenestración de la vaina del nervio óptico o la colocación de válvulas de derivación ventriculoperitoneal, pero dichas técnicas se reservan para los casos de persistencia de la clínica a pesar del tratamiento médico o si el deterioro visual es rápido. La realización de punciones lumbares evacuadoras seriadas está desaconsejada en los últimos estudios. El pronóstico suele ser favorable, si bien no podemos olvidar que hay casos de HII fulminante con evolución tórpida y que suelen presentar un deterioro de la agudeza visual rápidamente progresivo desde el inicio del cuadro que precisan un abordaje terapéutico inmediato y más agresivo. Lo habitual suele ser que la cefalea y la diplopía mejoren a los pocos días, aunque es preciso un seguimiento oftalmológico estrecho. El papiledema es el predictor más importante de pérdida de visión en estos pacientes [ La HII en la edad pediátrica es una enfermedad poco frecuente; sin embargo, se ha descrito un aumento de la incidencia en los últimos años. Es fundamental un diagnóstico y un tratamiento precoces para evitar posibles secuelas irreversibles, y destaca la importancia del seguimiento multidisciplinar y coordinado entre neuropediatras, oftalmólogos y neurocirujanos. No debemos olvidar que se trata de un diagnóstico de exclusión, de ahí la necesidad de orientar las pruebas complementarias que han de realizarse, y es de vital importancia la valoración del fondo de ojo y la realización de la tomografía de coherencia óptica para valorar la eficacia del tratamiento.","['Acetazolamida', 'Agudeza visual', 'Cefalea', 'Hipertensión intracraneal', 'Líquido cefalorraquídeo', 'Papiledema', 'Acetazolamide', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Headache', 'Intracranial hypertension', 'Papilledema', 'Visual acuity']",2024-8-01,Revista de Neurología,"""chlamydia"""
11468966,Sublingual Boosting with a Novel Mucoadhesive Thermogelling Hydrogel Following Parenteral CAF01 Priming as a Strategy Against ,"
 The optimal thermosensitive, mucoadhesive and stable hydrogel (OGEL) developed through artificial intelligence tools within the concept of “Quality by Design” is useful as a carrier for chlamydia subunit vaccine CTH522. The sublingual administration of OGEL/CTH522, after parenteral immunization with CAF01/CTH522 (cationic liposomes), promotes Th1&Th17 immune responses in a mouse model and elicit local IgA response in the genital tract.
","Sexual transmitted infections lead to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their high incidence rate has a great impact on healthcare systems, causing high social and economic costs. Mucosal surfaces are the main entry site for most pathogens—including Ct—and are therefore protected by a highly specialized immune system. The stimulation of the mucosal immune system by pathogen invasion or vaccination can induce both systemic and local mucosal immune responses. Nasal mucosa has been used as an effective immunization route against Chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections. The sublingual route is accessible for drug administration and patient‐friendly. Moreover, sublingual tissue contains plenty of antigen‐presenting dendritic cells that can recirculate to distant lymph nodes and spleen, and also induce IgA and IgG antibodies and cytotoxic T cells in the genital tract. A promising strategy could be the development of mucoadhesive thermogelling hydrogels. These formulations can be easily administered under the tongue due to their liquid nature and resist wash out by becoming semisolid at body temperature. As described above, the combination of systemic and mucosal routes is beneficial to induce more robust immune responses against Chlamydia. The aim of the present work was to explore the usefulness of sublingual boosting with vaccine‐loaded mucoadhesive thermosensitive hydrogels posterior to systemic priming as a strategy for immunization against Chlamydia. For this purpose, the Chlamydia CTH522 vaccine antigen was administered in two sequential doses. First subcutaneously using CAF01 as adjuvant and then sublingually using either CTH522 alone or loaded into hydrogels. The capacity to induce immune responses of two sequential sublingual administrations with the CTH522‐loaded hydrogel was also evaluated. Pluronic F127 (PF127) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma‐Aldrich (USA). Hybrane S1200 (HS1200) was acquired from Polymer Factory (Sweden). Gantrez AN119 (AN119) was kindly provided by Ashland (Spain). Trehalose 6,6´dibehenate (TDB) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (USA). Cell Strainers presenting a pore size of 40 µm and 100 µm were purchased from Corning Incorporated (USA). Purified rat anti‐mouse IL‐17A, biotin rat anti‐mouse IL‐17A, purified rat anti‐mouse IFN‐ The database generated in our previous investigation (Table  Data were split into two sets, 16 records for training and 3 for error testing. The parameters selected for INForm modeling are shown in  Training parameters used for INForm modeling The accuracy of the ANN models was assessed using the determination coefficient ( The optimal hydrogel formulation (OGEL) obtained following the INForm model was produced following the protocol previously reported by Garcia‐del Rio et al. A rheometer AR1000‐N (TA Instruments, UK) was used to estimate hydrogels' storage (G′) and loss moduli (G″), using a cone‐plate geometry of 6 cm Ø and 2.1 degrees. Both moduli were recorded from 15 to 40 °C at 0.4 °C min A TA XT plus Texture Analyzer (Surrey, UK) was used to obtain the texturometric profile of the optimized hydrogels. All texturometric properties (mucoadhesion, gel strength, adhesion, and cohesion) evaluated in this work were performed at 37 °C following protocols previously described. Briefly, bovine buccal tissue was used as a model of oral mucosa to measure mucoadhesion work. Buccal mucosa was cut into pieces of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm and glued to the punch of the texturometer, then a Petri dish containing 3 g of OGEL was attached to the lower support of the texturometer. The punch descended at 1 mm s To estimate gel strength, adhesion work, and cohesion, two compression cycles were performed. As for mucoadhesion, the punch descended at 1 mm s Bovine serum albumin (BSA), having a similar molecular weight to CTH522, The effect of storage on the properties of OGEL was evaluated after one year at 4 °C in closed containers. Texturometric, rheological, and release properties were re‐analyzed after storage. CAF01 liposomes were obtained through the hydration method, allowing the formation of large and heterogeneous multilamellar vesicles as it was previously reported. CAF01 and OGEL formulations were loaded under sterile conditions with the antigen selected, the recombinant CTH522 chlamydia protein. CAF01 liposomes were loaded by dissolving CTH522 in Tris‐buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) supplemented with 9% trehalose and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with CAF01. The final CTH522 concentration was 0.025 µg µl An accurate amount of CTH522 stock solution was added to OGEL hydrogel to achieve an antigen concentration of 0.2 µgµl Animal experiments were conducted at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) according to the regulations established by the Danish Ministry of Justice and animal protection committees by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate Permit 2017‐15‐0201‐01363 and in compliance with the European Community Directive 2010/63. All protocols have been subjected to ethical review and approved by SSI. Seven to nine‐week old CB6F1 female mice were housed at SSI and handled by authorized staff. Animals were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 4 consisted of three animals, while groups 2 and 3 consisted of four and five animals, respectively. The immunization schedule is depicted in  Immunization schedule and experimental groups tested. Animals were primed subcutaneously (s.c) or sublingually (s.l) using CAF01 and OGEL as vaccine delivery systems, respectively. Thus, mice from Groups 1, 2, and 3 were immunized with CAF01/CTH522 (s.c) meanwhile Group 4 was mucosally vaccinated with OGEL/CTH522 (s.l). On days 15 and 35, except animals from Group 1, mice were boosted twice through sublingual (s.l) route with CHT522 alone (Group 2) or loaded into OGEL formulation (Groups 3 and 4). Groups 1 to 3 were subcutaneously primed at the base of the tail with 200 µl of CAF01/CTH522, which contained 5 µg of CTH522, 250 µg of DDA, and 50 µg of TDB. Group four was sublingually primed with 10 µl of OGEL (OGEL/CTH522), which contained 2 µg of CTH522 dispersed in the hydrogel. After mucosal vaccination, mice were placed in ante‐flexion posture for 20 min. Then, groups 2 to 4 were boosted twice sublingually (days 15 and 35), with 2 µg of CTH522 alone (Group 2) or included within 10 µl of OGEL system (Groups 3 and 4). Group 1, vaccinated only with CAF01/CTH522 was established as control. Mice were euthanized 3 weeks after the last mucosal boosting. At the end of the study, an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for the quantification of IgA and total IgG in serum and vaginal lavage. Briefly, blood samples were collected from the tail vein in a heparinized tube (1% w/v heparin) and centrifuged at 10 000  IFN‐ Results from hydrogel characterization and in vivo experiments are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics 26) was employed to perform a one‐way ANOVA and HSD Tukey's post hoc tests ( Combinations of PF127, HS1200, and AN119 polymers have been demonstrated to be useful for obtaining thermosensitive and mucoadhesive hydrogels. The properties of the optimal hydrogel composition (OGEL) selected by INForm following Table  Values predicted by the ANN model and experimental values for the parameters characterized for OGEL freshly prepared and after 1 year of storage at 4 °C in closed containers The mucoadhesive character of OGEL is shown in  Image of OGEL after the contact with the bovine buccal tissue using the settings for the texturometric properties assessment. A mouse study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of OGEL as a sublingual vaccine carrier against Chlamydia. Thus, mice were administered CTH522 in CAF01 subcutaneously or followed by a sublingual boost. In addition, sublingual vaccination alone was also evaluated. We established parenterally immunized animals with CAF01/CTH522 as the control group due to naïve animals did not show CTH522‐specific antibodies and cytokines (Figures  Total IgG and IgA determined by ELISA in serum A, B) and vaginal lavage C, D). The  Optimal vaccination against  IFN‐ The use of mucosal tissues as a vaccination route is grounded in the fact that most infections are initiated at the mucosal surfaces. Parenteral vaccines may be effective when the infection occurs in the urogenital tract because it is more permeable to the transudation of serum antibodies than other mucosae. The antibody titers however must be high, The promotion of high IgA titers able to neutralize pathogens at the target mucosal surface(s) is extraordinarily challenging, even when a mucosal tissue is used as an immunization site. Sublingual vaccination can induce IgA responses with similar mucosal tropisms to nasal vaccination, but is generally considered less immunogenic. The liquid texture of OGEL facilitates its application and extension on the sublingual mucosa, while its thermosensitive properties allow a fast sol‐gel transition at body temperature, avoiding formulation leakage by swallowing. Furthermore, a highly mucoadhesive hydrogel should increase the contact time with the sublingual epithelium and facilitate antigen uptake. These properties make OGEL a good candidate as a vaccine carrier for this route of administration. Previous studies have used CAF01 as a vaccine adjuvant against Chlamydia, Our results point to a synergistic effect of parenteral and sublingual vaccination, as mice immunized by the two routes produced higher IgA titers and developed stronger cellular responses in splenocytes and cervical lymph nodes than when using a single route. Similar results were observed in mice simultaneously vaccinated intramuscularly and intranasally with  The results herein described that sublingual boosting after systemic priming could be a feasible strategy to induce systemic as well as mucosal immunity in the genital tract. In addition, our results suggest that the use of mucoadhesive vaccine delivery systems could be a strategy to maximize the boosting effect of sublingual immunization and therefore, improve mucosal immune responses in the genital tract. However, the success of this approach will depend on the development of highly mucoadhesive vaccine carriers capable of promoting a fast antigen permeation through sublingual tissue, thus ensuring an adequate stimulation of the immune system. Sublingual administration of CTH522 loaded OGEL after subcutaneous CAF01/CTH522 priming elicited IgA responses in serum and vaginal fluids, as well as IFN‐ Mouse oral anatomy differs from that of humans, particularly regarding the sublingual mucosa, which is highly keratinized in mice. High levels of keratinization strongly hinder the permeability of active substances across tissues. ANN together with genetic algorithms has demonstrated its potential to optimize a ternary hydrogel formulation through a reduced experimental design, giving rise to OGEL, a highly mucoadhesive and thermosensitive hydrogel suitable as a vaccine carrier for sublingual administration. OGEL has shown utility as a carrier of the chlamydia vaccine CTH522 in a mouse model. The co‐administration of CAF01 and OGEL loaded with CTH522 subunit vaccine significantly enhanced IFN‐ The authors declare no conflict of interest.

This systematic review synthesises evidence on the barriers and facilitators to women’s access to SRH services in rural Australia, considering both supply and demand dimensions. We systematically searched peer-reviewed literature published between 2013 and 2023. Search terms were derived from three major topics: (1) women living in rural Australia; (2) spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and (3) barriers or facilitators. We adopted the “best fit” approach to framework synthesis using the patient-centred access to healthcare model. Database searches retrieved 1,024 unique records, with 50 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed access to primary care services ( This review highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SRH service access disparities in rural Australia.

 Types of sexual and reproductive health services in Australia • Immunisation and vaccination • Cervical screening • STI screening • Disease prevention programs • General practitioner for services such as contraception counselling, intrauterine device insertion, medical abortion prescription • Pharmacy for services such as dispensing of emergency contraception and medical abortion medicine • Community health and family planning • Referred medical specialist services, such as gynaecology, obstetrics, and fertility services • Diagnostic services • Inpatient • Outpatient clinics • Emergency department care Source: Adapted from AIHW [ A literature search was conducted on 15 November 2023, using six electronic databases: EMBASE (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Health Policy Reference Center (EBSCOhost), Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition (EBSCOhost), Global Health (EBSCOhost), and MEDLINE Complete (EBSCOhost). A comprehensive list of search terms was developed from a preliminary search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and a review of relevant literature, such as SRH systematic reviews. The keywords in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used to index articles were utilised to develop the full search strategy. A combination of search terms related to the following concepts: [1] women living in rural, regional, or remote Australia; [2] spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and [3] barriers or facilitators to access. A supplementary file outlines the complete search strategies (see Supplementary file  All identified citations were collated and uploaded into Endnote (Version 20.2.1, Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA). Citations were then imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were dual-screened in Covidence by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC) using the prespecified eligibility criteria. Potentially relevant studies were retrieved as full texts and dual-assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage were recorded. Reference lists of included studies were screened for additional studies. Any reviewer disagreements during the selection process were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies by SW using Excel and tabulated with the following headings: author, year, health service setting, health discipline, context, geographic location according to MMM or ASGS-RA, population characteristics, study objective, study design, barriers, facilitators, summary of findings, study limitations, and implications. Ten per cent of the extracted data were cross-checked by another reviewer (LA). Any reviewer disagreements were resolved through discussion or with an additional reviewer. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for the appropriate study design (e.g., analytical cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, cohort studies) [ Study characteristics (e.g., barriers or facilitators, SRH service) were tabulated and synthesised narratively to describe the available evidence. The “best fit” approach to framework synthesis outlined by Carroll et al.

 Summary table of included articles ( Staff from community-based non-government Women’s Health Centres ( Rural women who had an abortion in the last 15 years ( General practice Maternity care Clinicians ( Aboriginal women ( Healthcare consumer Healthcare provider Indigenous girls ( Health professionals ( The highest proportion of studies were conducted in New South Wales (NSW) ( The highest proportion of studies were focused on maternity care settings ( Key barriers and facilitators are presented under the five dimensions of the patient-centred access to healthcare model (Fig.  Approachability represents the capacity of a health system to provide services so that women with health needs can identify and reach them [ Three main barriers were identified for approachability: insufficient information, fragmented healthcare pathways, and limited internet access. Insufficient information primarily related to gaps in the information provided by GPs around maternity care providers [ Three main barriers emerged related to women’s ability to perceive healthcare: low health literacy, limited awareness, and difficulties in navigating the health system. The barrier of low health literacy was predominantly related to cervical screening [ Two main facilitators were identified for approachability: health system improvements and enhanced education and institutional approaches. Health system improvements pertained to changes to the health system, such as providing culturally accessible information and roles for Aboriginal Health Practitioners (AHP) to work with the community and coordinate access to screening services [ Three facilitators were identified for women’s ability to perceive healthcare: information access, knowledge and awareness, and culturally appropriate information. Information access was primarily related to internet access, as this was the most common way women accessed information, and ease of access to information determined the choice of provider [ Acceptability relates to cultural and social factors that affect a woman’s ability to accept or seek health services or aspects of them. For example, the gender or social group of the provider or the beliefs associated with systems of medicine may reduce the acceptability of seeking care [ Three primary barriers were identified for acceptability: negative provider attitudes, low-quality care, and privacy concerns. Negative provider attitudes were frequently reported by women and included GPs’ unwillingness to refer for abortion services or denying care altogether, leaving women needing to locate willing providers themselves [ Three barriers were identified for women’s ability to seek healthcare: lack of cultural safety, stigma, embarrassment and perceived judgment, and community context challenges. Lack of cultural safety primarily affected maternity care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, whereby standard maternity care was not deemed culturally safe, with limited cross-cultural understanding of medical care [ Three facilitators were identified for acceptability: inclusive and culturally sensitive practices, enhanced privacy with flexible service delivery, and improved health system practices. Culturally sensitive practices involved ensuring cultural safety and consulting women on their cultural needs around birth [ The main facilitator for women’s ability to seek healthcare was related to care preferences. Birthing in the local community was reported to be a positive experience for women [ Availability and accommodation refer to the ability to access health services and healthcare providers, both physically and promptly. Availability means enough health resources to provide services, including the providers’ characteristics (e.g., presence of the health professional, qualification) and how services are delivered [ Three barriers were identified for availability and accommodation: poor local access, inadequate health service availability, and limited provider availability. Poor local access was related to the lack of and fragmented local services. For example, ultrasound or pathology services were not available at the same location as the care provider, requiring patients to travel [ Three barriers were identified that impacted a woman’s ability to reach healthcare: transportation issues, increased travel, and relocation for care. Transportation issues were particularly relevant for women without a driving licence or car, as they had to depend on public transportation or family and friends [ Facilitators identified for availability and accommodation encompassed the enhancement of local service provision and capacity, and increased resource accessibility. Strategies to enhance local service provision and capacity involved increasing their capacity [ One facilitator was identified for women’s ability to reach healthcare: time and travel efficiency. This was related to telehealth appointments [ Affordability pertains to a woman’s economic ability to allocate resources and time to necessary health services. The direct costs of services, related expenses, and the potential loss of income influence it. Affordability can differ based on the type of service and relies on the ability to acquire the resources needed to cover care costs [ Two primary barriers to affordability were identified: high direct costs and costs associated with essential products. The high direct costs identified across multiple studies included limited bulk-billing options [ Two barriers were found to hinder a woman’s ability to pay for healthcare: high travel-related costs and the financial burden of indirect costs. High travel-related costs were reported in four studies for women who were required to travel for care [ Two facilitators emerged for affordability, including cost reduction strategies, and policy and incentive support. Cost reduction strategies involved the increased use of telehealth services due to lower associated costs [ Service affordability was identified as a facilitator for women’s ability to pay for healthcare. Improving access and availability of MToP appointments and medication in rural areas was found to be much more affordable than accessing SToP [ Appropriateness refers to the overall clinical benefit for the woman and whether the expected health benefits (e.g., improved quality of life) outweigh the potential negative consequences (e.g., time, cost). Appropriateness also includes adequacy, which pertains to the quality of the type and model of services provided and their continuity [ Two barriers were found for appropriateness: limitations in telehealth accessibility and care discontinuities. The limitations in telehealth accessibility were linked to language barriers for non-English speaking women and the absence of visual cues for the visually impaired [ Two barriers were also identified for women’s ability to engage in healthcare, including a lack of support systems and psychological effects. Lack of support systems pertained to women who were required to relocate to give birth. Women who relocated experienced disconnection and distress from leaving family support and also reported inadequate caregiver support for existing children [ Two facilitators were identified for appropriateness, including telehealth accessibility and patient-centred care. One study found that the accessibility of telehealth helped to promote relationship-building with a provider before the patient was required to travel [ Thirty-nine studies (78%) were assessed using the JBI quality appraisal tool for qualitative design, while sixteen studies (32%) were evaluated using the JBI quality appraisal tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. A supplementary file includes the quality appraisal for all studies (see Supplementary file  To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesise the evidence on the spatial and aspatial barriers and facilitators that women experience in accessing SRH services in rural healthcare settings in Australia. This review highlighted significant barriers and facilitators from supply and demand access dimensions. Many of the facilitators to SRH access identified in this review relate to women’s empowerment. Empowerment refers to the ability of women to make choices and exercise agency and decision-making through expanded access to and control over resources and changes to the institutional structures that affect their lives [ Health literacy can contribute to women’s empowerment and agency by giving them the tools to access, understand, and use health information to participate in shared decision-making, which is essential for enabling patient-centred care [ Patient-centred care was a facilitator identified in the appropriateness and ability to engage dimension. Continuity of carer was identified as a significant factor in access to maternity care, also highlighted in other systematic reviews of access to antenatal care in high-income countries [ Despite emphasising patient-centred care, negative provider attitudes pose significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly accessing abortion care in rural areas. A recent scoping review highlighted the relationship between negative attitudes, abortion stigma and quality of care, contributing to the gatekeeping and obstruction of abortion access [ In addition to addressing negative provider attitudes, it is crucial to acknowledge the affordability and ability to pay dimension, as the financial barriers further hinder access to essential SRH services for women in rural areas. Some women in the included studies reported a lack of information and difficulties accessing financial incentives for maternity care relocation, such as Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) [ Healthcare expenses paid directly by individuals in Australia comprise 17 per cent of the country’s healthcare expenditures [ Beyond the immediate health implications, it is essential to recognise the broader societal benefits associated with improving access to SRH services in rural communities. Addressing the barriers to accessing SRH services in rural areas holds wider societal benefits, including economic and social outcomes [ Considering the critical need to address barriers to SRH access in rural Australia, policymakers must prioritise targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility. First, there is a pressing need for health service redesign and interventions prioritising women’s empowerment and control over their health. Further research across different states, particularly those with significant rural populations (e.g., Western Australia), is essential to capture the diverse needs of these communities and ensure patient-centred care. This includes the prioritisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s voices in developing culturally safe antenatal care models and addressing barriers to antenatal and birthing care, especially in rural and remote Australia. Further, there needs to be a consistent use of geographic classification systems relevant to policy in rural research to facilitate decision-making from findings [ A strength of this systematic review is the use of rigorous and robust methods to identify, appraise and synthesise the literature pertaining to the barriers and facilitators to spatial and aspatial access to women’s SRH services in rural Australian healthcare settings. In particular, the comprehensive search and selection process identified a large number of included studies published in the last ten years. This review builds on existing evidence to understand health service accessibility in Australia [ Identifying the barriers and facilitators for women in accessing essential SRH services within the rural context is a necessary step for the development of comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions that address the diverse needs of rural women. Our study supports the need for targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility in rural areas. These include a comprehensive review of Medicare rebates and PBS subsidised items to enhance affordability and accessibility to SRH care, investment in digital healthcare infrastructure, and health service redesign prioritising co-design and a person-centred approach to ensure the service meets the needs of rural women. Further research is required to target the access barriers to SRH services and address the disparities in health service distribution and health inequity in rural Australia.

11467560,Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance of Restricted Antibiotics in a Level III Government Hospital,"The objectives of the study were to determine the antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics and to correlate this with resistance rate. A retrospective review of pharmacy dispensing records was conducted in the adult internal medicine wards of a tertiary level teaching hospital in the Philippines between March 2019 to February 2020. Antibiotic consumption was determined using Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days (PD). Correlations between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance of restricted antibiotics were done. Outcomes were compared between Ward 1 (with the presence of a unit-dose pharmacist) and Ward 3 (without a unit-dose pharmacist). Both wards showed decreasing trends of piperacillin-tazobactam consumption and increasing trends of ceftazidime consumption from quarter 1 to quarter 4. It was observed that levofloxacin was the most prescribed fluoroquinolone with the highest consumption recorded from March to May 2019 in Ward 3 of 350.2 DDD/1000 PD as compared with ciprofloxacin which has the highest consumption (23.3 DDD/1000 PD) during the period June to August 2019 in Ward 1. Antibiotic resistance of  The restriction and pre-authorization strategy of the AMS program has greatly contributed to the decrease in the consumption of almost all restricted antibiotics. This strategy has been helpful in minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use associated with inappropriate drug therapy. The success of the AMS program has been based on the collective efforts of the AMS team with the implementation of hospital policies, such as the AMS program, across the different sites in the hospital in order to achieve optimum patient health outcomes. It was noted that the resistance rates of ","The rapid emergence of resistant bacterial infections is occurring worldwide, endangering the efficacy of antibiotics. The acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is caused by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Antimicrobial consumption data are collected using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) methodology developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology. Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is a Level III government hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila. It is the largest government hospital within Metro Manila with its 1,500-bed capacity. Since May 2016, the PGH Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Program has been implemented within the hospital and has been organizing and providing training on AMS to other hospitals. The program is designed to enable antimicrobial prescriber (PGH physicians) as well as antimicrobial dispensers (PGH pharmacists) and practicing nurses, to use antimicrobial agents in the most rational, effective, efficient manner and eventually help curb antimicrobial resistance. The WHO carried out a comprehensive review of antibiotics and classified antibiotics into Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) groups. The main goal is to reduce the use of Watch Group and Reserve Group antibiotics, the most crucial antibiotics for human medicine and are at higher risk of resistance, and increase the use of Access Group. In accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and its 2016 IRR, the principal investigator has complied with the institution’s policies on handling patient information. Data collection started after securing the approval of UP Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB) and Extended Hospital Research Office (EHRO) of PGH. All the study team members have ensured the data privacy and patient’s confidentiality by identifying each patient with subject-generated identification codes to be recorded in the data collection form. Only the members of the research team have accessed to the database all throughout the implementation of study. A retrospective cross-sectional design was conducted between two wards under the Department of Medicine from March 2019 to February 2020. Since retrospective data collection was done manually by checking each patient’s dispensing record, the principal investigator has opted to cover only one-year data. Both wards have a 50-bed capacity in PGH, a level III government hospital. This study determined and compared the antimicrobial consumption of drugs for systemic use (ATC group J01) specifically restricted antibiotics using the DDD per 1000 patient days. Only Ward 5 (neurosciences ward) and Ward 1 (medicine ward) have a unit-dose pharmacist in the entire charity In-patient wards. The Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 were chosen because these were comparable based on the differences of medication distribution system. Ward 1 has a modified unit-dose drug distribution system (MUDDDS) with the participation of a unit-dose pharmacist. On the other hand, Ward 3 has an individual medication order system without a unit-dose pharmacist. The study also correlated antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics and antibiotic resistance rate of the top ten resistant microorganisms found in the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3. The study included pharmacy dispensing records of charity in-patients who were admitted and transferred to the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. Patients who were prescribed and dispensed with at least one dose of intravenous restricted antibiotics regardless of age, sex, and co-morbidities were included in the study. The CVR (content validity ratio), also known as Lawshe’s method, was used to quantify content validity of the antibiotic consumption form. Five infectious disease pharmacists, who have undergone training on infectious diseases at University of the Philippines Manila, have been asked to evaluate the validity of the items in the data collection form using the evaluation sheet by indicating whether it is essential (item to be included in the form) or non-essential (item to be removed from the data collection form).
 The result was computed using the above formula. CVR stands for content validity ratio,  The Open ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system was used to gather necessary data needed in the antibiotic consumption form. Data on antibiotic use were collected quarterly from March 2019 to February 2020 and antibiotic consumption data were expressed as DDD per 1000 patient-days. Data on the total number of units or vials were entered and analyzed using Antimicrobial Consumption Tool version 2019 developed by Arno Muller in 2018. Antibiotic resistance (%) were gathered from the antibiogram of the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 provided by the Hospital Infection Control Unit of the hospital. Correlations between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance in each ward were determined for those with at least six (6) observation months or complete information on resistance rates from March 2019 to February 2020. Trend analysis of quarterly consumption of restricted antibiotics was used to analyze pattern of use of antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics. Data on antibiotic consumption was converted to DDD per 1000 patient-days. Independent t-test was used in the comparison of antibiotic consumption and comparison of resistance rates between Ward 1 and Ward 3. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to measure the strength of a correlation between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance rates. There were decreasing trends of piperacillin-tazobactam consumption on both wards ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under watch group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020. There was a sudden increase in ciprofloxacin consumption in Ward 1 during June to August 2019 but was of relatively same levels in the remaining quarters of the observation period, while consumption in Ward 3 dropped in the second and fourth quarters ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under watch group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020. For ertapenem, consumption increased from March to November 2019 in both wards but shrank in December 2019 to February 2020 ( Colistin consumption was observed to decrease from quarter 1 through 4 in both wards, with greater consumption levels in Ward 1 compared to Ward 3 except in September to November 2019 ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under reserve group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020.

Data can be shared with the AMS team of hospital and relevant information can be further cascaded to other institutions and to Department of Health to track the progress of AMS interventions in reducing antibiotic consumption and resistance. The decreasing trends in consumption of piperacillin-tazobactam showed a decreased use of piperacillin-tazobactam among patients. Based on the antibiogram result, gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated from patients’ samples. Decreasing trend of vancomycin consumption may be associated with its inactivity against gram-negative bacteria, hence, the decreased in usage. The increase in the antibiotic consumption of ceftazidime must be monitored as it has the highest resistance recorded against  Although levofloxacin was the preferred fluoroquinolone compared with ciprofloxacin, its consumption fell in both wards from quarter 1 through quarter 4 due to decreased use in the wards which could mean that prevalence of infection does not require its use. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are both recommended for clinical application in UTIs and, though commonly prescribed, there’s no conclusion on the comparative merit of the either one. Levofloxacin shows advantage over ciprofloxacin in terms of efficacy, disease reoccurrence, and adverse event. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone which exhibit improved intracellular penetration and broadened coverage, which includes  Ertapenem consumption was three times lower as compared with meropenem consumption because the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against  Colistin consumption decreases as polymyxin consumption increases. Internal Medicine residents have opted to use polymyxin as polypeptide antibiotic than colistin. Polymyxin B is administered parenterally in its active form, while colistin is administered parenterally as an inactive pro-drug, colistimethate. In the study of Yadav et al., Based on the study findings, higher resistances of  The result of the present study is similar with the study of Lai et al., Both wards showed decreasing trends in consumption of watch antibiotics except for ceftazidime which could mean that the antimicrobial stewardship program of the hospital is serving its purpose in eliminating unnecessary use of restricted antibiotics. ATC/DDD methodologies are used to compare drug consumption among institutions, regions, and countries. However, DDD does not automatically reflect recommended or average prescribed dose. Instead, it is only a technical unit. It is referred to as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. Patient demographics such as age and sex were confounding variables in the study. As a person gets older, the greater is the risk of having infections due to comorbidities. Previous studies have found that male patients are more at risk of developing infections that would require the use of restricted antibiotics. In this study, the effect of these confounders was minimized by including male and female patients aged 18 to 95. Both medicine wards have the same rotating IM residents who handle the patients. Both wards cater patients who have hypertensive cardiovascular disease, cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, septic shock, diabetes, and hospital acquired pneumonia. The study had several limitations. First, the scope of the study included only one-year data which had led to sparse data in terms of antibiotic consumption and resistance. Second, the measurement of antibiotic use was based on the dispensing record of the pharmacy, not based on those actually consumed by admitted patients. Findings have limited extent of generalizability to other healthcare settings. Investigation of other possible reasons for the increase and decrease of antibiotic consumption was likewise limited because there was no direct access to patient chart. Assessment of clinical practice against set protocols and guidelines was beyond the scope of this study. The restriction and pre-authorization strategy of the AMS program has greatly contributed to the decrease in the consumption of almost all restricted antibiotics. This strategy has been helpful in minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use associated with inappropriate drug therapy. The success of the AMS program has been based on the collective efforts of the AMS team with the implementation of hospital policies, such as the AMS program, across the different sites in the hospital in order to achieve optimum patient health outcomes. There was no significant difference in terms of resistance rates of the top 10 most commonly isolated bacteria. However, it was noted that the resistance rates of  This study has supported the involvement of pharmacists in the AMS team by conducting auditing activities that promote safe compliance of restricted antibiotic use among patients. Pharmacists can greatly participate on either prospective or retrospective review of antibiotic utilization and analyze trends of antibiotic consumption data to provide feedback to prescribing physicians on prescribing patterns and possible correlation with occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Data in the collection and management of antibiotics, monitoring of use, and analyses of gaps for pharmacist-led interventions. With proper support and resources, a prospective study would be ideal in order for pharmacists to participate in antimicrobial stewardship interventions such as evaluation of antibiotic usage, adjustment on the dose for renal dysfunction, switching from parenteral to oral, de-escalation of empiric to narrow spectrum based on antibiogram result, escalation of empiric narrow spectrum to empiric broad spectrum antibiotic based on clinical deterioration of the patient and laboratory indicators as recommended by Boyles et al.","['antibiotic consumption', 'antibiotic resistance', 'restricted antibiotics']",2024-9-13,Acta Medica Philippina,"""chlamydia"""
11467246,The current status of women’s health nursing in the United States,,"With recent political developments in the United States (U.S.), such as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current status of women’s health nursing in the U.S. Initially, it describes the sociopolitical and academic contexts of women’s health nursing in the U.S. Subsequently, it addresses the current issues in women’s health nursing within the realms of education, practice, and research. Finally, the paper offers suggestions for the future of women’s health nursing. Up until the early 1990s, the U.S. did not experience the severe nurse shortages that are witnessed today. During the 1990s, hospital restructuring and downsizing led to numerous reports of hiring freezes and layoffs of registered nurses (RNs) [ Following seminal reports that highlighted lower patient morbidity and mortality rates in hospitals with a higher proportion of RNs [ Currently, the U.S. has fewer than 10 nurses per 1,000 population [ The situation among nursing faculty is similarly dismal. In recent years, virtually all mid-level and top-tier nursing schools in the U.S. have increasingly hired faculty members from outside the country. Specifically, the number of Korean nurse faculty members in the U.S. has grown significantly. In the late 1990s, there were only a few nursing professors of Korean heritage teaching at U.S. nursing schools. However, the Global Korean Nursing Foundation recently estimated that over 100 nursing professors of Korean heritage are currently working across the U.S. (based on per­sonal communication in 2022). Another noticeable trend highlighting the severe lack of nursing faculty in the U.S. is the ease with which Korean Ph.D. graduates, who earn their doctoral degrees in the U.S., can secure faculty positions in the U.S. and choose to stay after completing their degrees. In contrast, it is more challenging for them to obtain faculty positions in South Korea. Most nursing schools in the U.S. are now taking on the additional burden of supporting visas for overseas faculty members to ensure they have an adequate number of faculty members. Indeed, the shortage of nursing faculty has become a severe and inevitable phenomenon in recent years. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has played a pivotal role in shaping the trends and policies of nursing education in the U.S. In 2015, the IOM became the NAM, which subsequently issued a new Future of Nursing report following the COVID-19 pandemic [ The New Essentials led to a major shift in nursing education and nursing practice by emphasizing competency-based education. This focus has prompted extensive revisions in nursing curricula throughout the U.S., establishing the 10 domains of the New Essentials as foundational elements of nursing education. Notably, some updates to the essentials reflect the evolving healthcare needs in the U.S. For example, influenced largely by the COVID-19 pandemic, a new domain focusing on “quality and safety,” particularly in relation to disaster nursing, has been emphasized in the AACN New Essentials. A general sentiment was shared between the Future of Nursing report and the AACN New Essentials regarding these focal points, though there were subtle differences. For example, the Future of Nursing report places a strong emphasis on preparing a workforce well-versed in disaster nursing. In contrast, the AACN mentions disaster nursing under the category of “quality and safety.” Another distinction is seen in the treatment of nursing policy making; it was a prominent feature in the Future of Nursing, whereas in the AACN framework, it is incorporated under the domain of “professional leadership development.” Overall, the tone of the Future of Nursing report is relatively stronger than that of the AACN’s New Essentials. The women’s health workforce in the U.S. primarily consists of obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians, nurses, and physician assistants (PAs). Within the field of OB/GYN, there is a diverse range of board-certified subspecialists, including gynecologic oncology, female pelvic medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and maternal-fetal medicine. Consequently, patients must carefully consider their immediate healthcare needs to choose the appropriate provider. Another emerging trend is the growth of hospitalists, which shifts the focus from private practices to care primarily provided in hospital settings by teams of specialists. Additionally, there is an increasing concern over physician burnout and a decline in the number of clinical scientists. This decline is partly attributed to the fact that providers can maintain a comfortable living solely from clinical practice, avoiding the additional pressures associated with research. Technological advancements have also reshaped the practice of women’s health nurses. Hospitals across the U.S. are integrating new technologies such as robots for transporting supplies, robotic surgery, and the widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs). Despite these advancements aimed at enhancing healthcare delivery, the use of EMRs has been found to potentially increase the distance between providers and patients. This change underscores the growing importance of building strong rapport and interpersonal connections, particularly for nurses in women’s health. To understand the evolving trends, it is worthwhile to review the history of women’s health nursing in the U.S. The 1830s and 1840s marked the beginning of women’s health nursing in the U.S., coinciding with the first wave of feminism [ Some argue that women’s health nursing originated in the 1960s, a time when women’s reproductive rights were restricted and abortion was illegal [ In the 1980s, the conservative political environment gained momentum with the Reagan administration and the dominance of the Republican Party. During this period, anti-abortion activists began advocating for the repeal of legalized abortion. Consequently, feminist health clinics and fertility control clinics increasingly became targets of attack [ The 1980s and 1990s marked a significant period for women’s health, particularly following the formal establishment of the Congressional Caucus for Women’s Health Issues in 1977 as a Legislative Service Organization [ In 1993, a significant milestone was achieved when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a restriction that had been in place since 1977, which prohibited women from participating in new drug testing [ Readers may be familiar with the more recent upheavals since 2020. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn  In 2022, the American Nurses Association (ANA) declared that sexual health is a human right, that abortion is a reproductive health option, and that nurses should have the freedom to discuss these topics with patients to facilitate informed decision-making [ The ANA website currently offers guidelines for nurses operating in states with restrictive laws, advising them to carefully consider the ethical and legal complexities involved. For women’s health practitioners in these restrictive states, extreme caution is necessary for conversation and decision. In practice, many women living in restrictive states travel to states with more permissive laws to obtain abortions, including in situations where the pregnant woman’s life is at risk. This travel incurs significant costs and legal risks for the women involved. For nurse researchers, the NIH, particularly the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), represents the primary source of funding. Consequently, research trends have largely aligned with the focal areas emphasized by the NINR. Dr. Patricia A. Grady, PhD, RN, FAAN, who served as the Director of NINR for over two decades and holds a doctorate in physiology from the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, championed biobehavioral research that emphasized symptom science and palliative care. This influence is evident in the historical scientific priorities of the NINR, which include symptom science, wellness, end-of-life and palliative care, innovation promotion, and self-management. Accordingly, women’s health research has also been guided by these themes. Examples include studies on managing symptoms during the menopausal transition, encouraging physical activity among women, and fostering self-care for various specific health conditions throughout women’s lifespans. Since September 2020, Dr. Shannon N. Zenk, PhD, MPH, RN, has served as the director of the NINR. Her research interests in community-based studies and health disparities, coupled with the significant challenges posed by COVID-19 at the time of her appointment, have influenced a shift in the NINR’s focus. The Strategic Plan for 2022-2026, developed over the past 2 years, reflects these changes [ NINR has also issued guiding principles ( Under the significant influence of the recently published NIH and NINR strategic plans, research in women’s health that promotes health equity has seen a marked increase. For example, there has been a rise in the number of NIH-funded studies focusing on racial and ethnic minorities, including immigrant women, rural populations, gender minorities such as the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) community, and older adults. Another emerging trend is the growth in NIH-funded community-based participatory research (CBPR) studies. These studies are characterized by their large-scale population-based approach, which ensures meaningful contributions to the community. They also feature active involvement from community gatekeepers and consultants, and direct engagement of participants as team members. Additionally, since the establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute in 2010, following  What are the future directions for women’s health nursing? I believe that nursing education for women’s health must first and foremost undergo curricular changes to align with the new competencies mandated by the AACN essentials across various programs. Additionally, nursing education should include content on new technologies and subspecialties that are evident in practice. Given the multitude of ethical issues within women’s health nursing, this is another critical area for educational focus. Women’s health education also needs to integrate current trends in topics, populations, and methods, particularly at the graduate level. Furthermore, interdisciplinary partnerships in undergraduate education warrant more attention, especially concerning non-nursing preceptors, in light of the general decline in women’s health practitioners and the nursing workforce. Physicians, PAs, and social workers can provide non-traditional practice experiences for nursing students, who in turn can learn about the unique and critical roles these providers play in women’s health. Effective nursing practice in women’s health requires setting clear goals for the future nursing workforce. This approach will facilitate necessary actions, enable tracking of workforce outcomes, and help develop strategies to attract more nurses to the field of women’s health. Given the potential ethical issues associated with women’s health practice, open discussions about ethical contexts are crucial. These discussions can also inform and guide nursing education. Additionally, establishing funding sources for training more women’s health nurses would significantly strengthen the women’s health workforce. For nursing research in women’s health, it is imperative to stay informed about shifts in funding priorities, both nationally and internationally. It is equally important to recognize that research needs will evolve with demographic changes, necessitating the adoption of new methodologies and the integration of technological advancements. Building interdisciplinary research teams is vital, as collaboration is key for nurses to advance women’s health research. Additionally, women’s health nurses should actively engage in shaping and supporting policy changes to promote women’s health research. For example, when funding agencies, including the NIH, are developing their strategic plans, women’s health nurses must participate in the strategic planning process to ensure their research needs are adequately reflected in funding priorities. Lastly, there is a pressing need for more studies on the ethical and legal dilemmas in women’s health to provide the necessary evidence and guidance for women’s health practice and education.",[],2024-9-30,Women's Health Nursing,"""chlamydia"""
11466832,Immunological perspectives on atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression,"Atherosclerosis serves as the primary catalyst for numerous cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence suggests that the immune response is involved in every stage of atherosclerotic plaque evolution. Rapid, but not specific, innate immune arms, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and other innate immune cells, as well as pattern-recognition receptors and various inflammatory mediators, contribute to atherogenesis. The specific adaptive immune response, governed by T cells and B cells, antibodies, and immunomodulatory cytokines potently regulates disease activity and progression. In the inflammatory microenvironment, the heterogeneity of leukocyte subpopulations plays a very important regulatory role in plaque evolution. With advances in experimental techniques, the fine mechanisms of immune system involvement in atherosclerotic plaque evolution are becoming known. In this review, we examine the critical immune responses involved in atherosclerotic plaque evolution, in particular, looking at atherosclerosis from the perspective of evolutionary immunobiology. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between plaque evolution and plaque immunity provides clues for strategically combating atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) is a prominent global cause of mortality ( The evolution of atherosclerotic plaques can be broadly categorized into three stages: initiation, progression and complications. It has been shown that fatty streaks are the initial marker of atherosclerosis, which develops in four steps: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol uptake, endothelial cell (EC) activation, leukocyte activation and foam cell formation ( Among the many factors that influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques, the immune system plays a significant role. During the formation and development of atherosclerotic plaques, the local microenvironment undergoes a series of complex changes, accompanied by the infiltration of multiple immune cells. Evidence suggests that circulating monocytes and resident vascular macrophages are the earliest immune cells recruited into early atherosclerotic plaques ( The molecular signals that regulate leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesion sites are complex, and chemokines and their receptors play a key role and have received much attention in the study of atherosclerosis. Chemokines are a class of small, secreted cytokines with chemotactic properties. Depending on the location of their cysteine residues, they can be divided into four subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX With the advent and advancement of various experimental techniques, we have gained an understanding of the mechanisms involving the immune system in plaque evolution. Here, we view atherosclerotic plaque lesions from the perspective of evolutionary immunobiology, specifically reviewing the immunologic aspects of plaque evolution, including the immune responses involved, the effects of immune cell heterogeneity, and plaque dynamics in the inflammatory microenvironment. The goal is to provide insight into the search for immunotherapy for atherosclerosis. In 1859, Charles Darwin coined the phrase “natural selection” to describe the process of evolution as observed by the different survival outcomes of individuals under environmental stress owing to phenotypic differences. Natural selection has provided a crucial force in evolution ( Many believe that atherosclerosis is an inevitable progressive process that develops over time, but current evidence supports a more dynamic and discontinuous evolution of the atherosclerotic plaques ( The immune system is categorized into innate and adaptive responses. As the first line of defense against invading pathogens, innate immunity is characterized by its ability to produce rapid and nonspecific responses. The main types of cells in the innate immune system involve neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and DCs ( Evolution of immune cells in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Early in the lesion, monocytes/macrophages predominate. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which can uptake oxLDL to become foam cells, and also differentiate into inflammatory macrophages and IFNICs macrophages, which secrete IL-1, TNF-α, and type I interferon to exert pro-inflammatory effects, respectively; in addition, they can also be polarized into the M1, M4, and Mox phenotypes, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, or MMP, promoting atherosclerosis. In all stages of atherosclerosis, ILC1 is identified as the most abundant subset of ILCs and is involved in reinforcing plaque formation through the production of IFN-γ. Atherosclerotic lesions trigger migration and activation of NK cells as well as release of pro-atherogenic factors IFN-γ and TNF-α. Neutrophils secrete pro-inflammatory mediators such as NETs, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, increasing plaque inflammation and susceptibility to rupture. A large number of B cells with a structure similar to tertiary lymphoid organs are found in the adventitial layer of blood vessels, in which B2 cells secrete mediators that aggravate atherosclerosis such as IgG and BAFF. In advanced atherosclerosis, numerous T cells homing to the plaque. Activated DCs present cognate peptides on MHC class I molecules to CD8 The arterial wall is composed of three main layers: the intima, the media, and the adventitia. The intima is the innermost layer in contact with blood flow and is covered by a single layer of ECs on one side of the lumen (vascular endothelium) and an inner elastic layer on the peripheral side. The media consists mainly of VSMCs surrounded by ECM. The adventitia is composed of fibroblasts and connective tissue ( In addition to endothelial dysfunction, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction is also a key factor in plaque formation. PVAT, a mixture of brown and white adipose tissue that surrounds most of the vascular system, is thought to be an active component of the vascular wall that regulates vascular homeostasis and influences the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( Atherosclerotic plaque formation begins with endothelial dysfunction followed by LDL accumulation and its modification in the intima ( Lipid accumulation stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines by ECs. EC activation triggers the release of leukocyte adhesion molecules (AMs) and chemokines that stimulate inflammatory monocyte migration and infiltration. Infiltrated monocytes in the intima are stimulated to mature into macrophages by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by activated ECs ( Other innate immune cells such as neutrophils, Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and DCs can also influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Neutrophils are the major responders to tissue damage and infection, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators to neutralize dangers such as toxins ( ILCs are a unique type of lymphocytes that have been newly discovered in recent years. Five distinct subsets have been identified: ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, lymphoid tissue-inducing cells and NK cells. ILCs are mainly localized in barrier tissues such as skin, intestinal mucosa, and lung, and play an important role in innate immune response to infections, lymphangiogenesis, and remodeling of damaged tissues by responding to microenvironmental signals released from surrounding tissue ( NK cells are innate immune system effector lymphocytes that sense pathologic alterations or stressed cells by activating receptors and play a cell-mediated cytotoxic role through the release of granzymes and perforin or cytokines, as in the case of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ( DCs are present in healthy arteries and can accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions. They are especially enriched in rupture-prone areas within atherosclerotic plaques, which can lead to plaque destabilization, and are involved in a variety of pathogenic and protective mechanisms during plaque formation. In the earliest stages of plaque formation, DCs may uptake lipids and form a foam-cell-like appearance, as well as regulate lipid metabolism through other mechanisms ( The antigen-specific adaptive immune responses are triggered after the innate immune response and are mediated by T and B cells ( T cells are recruited into atherosclerotic plaques through a mechanism that resembles monocyte recruitment via the receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is expressed by all CD4 The CD4 Various studies have come to distinct conclusions about the effects of CD8 Atherosclerotic plaque formation is intensely influenced by diverse arms of the immune system, including B lymphocytes ( The earliest evidence that B cells are involved in atherosclerosis in mice came from Caligiuri et al. ( Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, with inflammation having an essential role in all stages of the pathogenic process, encompassing plaque formation, progression, and rupture. Inflammation is the response to the existence of exogenous and endogenous antigens by the immune system. In general, driven by the immune system, inflammation profoundly influences the evolutionary trajectory of atherosclerotic plaques. Inflammation underlies atherosclerotic plaque formation. Plaque inflammation is driven by cytokines, chemokines, AMs, inflammatory signaling pathways, bioactive lipids, and immune cells ( Infiltration and retention of oxLDL in the arterial wall serve as critical initiating events that trigger the inflammatory response and facilitate atherosclerotic plaque formation ( SRs are distributed on arterial vessel wall cells and vascular ECs, and oxLDL binds to the corresponding receptors to promote the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques through multiple mechanisms. CD36 is a pattern recognition receptor expressed on multiple cell types and is a part of the class B family of SRs. CD36 is not only involved in the uptake of oxLDL and foam cell formation, but also in atherosclerotic plaque formation by interacting with oxLDL and triggering an inflammatory response ( The accumulation of oxLDL and its binding to receptors initiate plaque inflammation, while the infiltration of immune cells, the activation of plaque-associated inflammatory signaling pathways, and the response to host tissues and microorganisms maintain the development of inflammation, thereby further accelerating the evolution of plaque. Infiltration and accumulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory leukocytes in the intima of the arterial wall are hallmarks of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression, as well as drivers of atherosclerotic lesion growth. Immune cell infiltration is triggered by chemokines and AMs ( Signaling pathways that are mediated by immune, inflammatory mediators are associated with the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) serves as the primary transcription factor in the inflammatory response. The NF-κB pathway is induced and activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines and growth factors and exerts a pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque inflammation ( Research into atherosclerotic plaque development has also focused on the host tissues and microorganisms that may influence this process. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is present in atherosclerotic plaques, where ECs can obtain a mesenchymal phenotype, with loss of expression of EC markers and function, and gain of expression of mesenchymal cell markers and function, directly contributing to plaque evolution ( Furthermore, the presence of microorganisms in atherosclerotic plaques is well recognized. Pathogenic microorganisms are able to infect arterial wall cells, facilitate local inflammation of the plaque, evoke an adaptive immune response and influence plaque progression. For example,  In addition to bacteria, some viruses can also influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is capable of infecting almost all plaque immune cells, expressing viral cytokines and chemokines to promote an inflammatory environment, and triggering plaque formation through mechanisms such as induction of endothelial damage, increased lipid deposition, and VSMC proliferation and migration ( Leukocyte subsets accumulate at different stages of plaques and are involved in the immune response in the atherosclerotic lesion process. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) reveals heterogeneity of immune cells in atherosclerotic plaques ( Monocytes are heterogeneous populations and human blood monocytes are classified into three subpopulations according to differences in the expression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor CD14 and the FcγIII receptor CD16: classical CD14 Heterogeneity of monocytes/macrophages and DCs in atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and DCs share a common origin in myeloid progenitor (MP). Monocyte-DC precursor (MDP) gives rise to monocytes and common DC precursor (CDP). Among them, mouse monocytes are classified into two subsets according to their surface expression of Ly-6C. Ly6C Different monocyte/macrophage subsets play different roles in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Classical CD14 Murine monocytes are the most studied. The Ly6C Indeed, macrophage phenotype is influenced by microenvironmental factors within the atherosclerotic plaques. Both M1 and M2 macrophage populations are present and increasing in number throughout the atherosclerotic process ( Recently, many research studies have revealed the presence of other macrophage subsets in atherosclerotic plaques, in addition to M1 and M2 types. M4 macrophages are induced by CXCL4, which is widely expressed in plaques, and exert atherosclerotic effects by producing MMP12, MMP7, and MMP9 leading to increased plaque vulnerability ( Single-cell techniques have greatly improved our understanding of macrophage subsets in plaques. Zernecke et al. ( DCs are heterogeneous blood-borne professional antigen-presenting cells with the ability to capture, process, and present antigens to T cells that recognize antigens and induce antigen-specific immune responses ( mDCs are characterized by the expression of CD1c, CD11c, and CD33 and they secrete IL-12. In contrast the pDCs express CD123 and produce type I IFN ( Several studies have discussed the role of pDCs in atherosclerotic plaque evolution. In a mouse model of atherosclerosis, depletion of pDCs using multiple antibodies against bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) promotes the accumulation of T cells in plaques, leading to enhanced atherosclerosis in  Pre-DCs are the final precursor stage in the formation of DCs, and they can develop into DCs without dendrites but require further development to obtain dendritic forms and full DC function. Little cell division is involved in their development into DCs, leading to different types of DCs being produced by different pre-DCs, such as some monocytes, pDCs, and cDCs ( In atherosclerotic plaques, T cells are less numerous than monocytes/macrophages, but like monocytes/macrophages that exhibit heterogeneity in markers and function, T cells also exhibit heterogeneity and regulate the adaptive immune response to plaque. CD4 Heterogeneity of CD4 Th1 is the prominent T cell subtype in atherosclerotic lesions and Th1 cytokines predominate in atherosclerotic mouse models and human plaques. They secrete mainly IFN-γ, which exerts a pro-atherogenic effect ( Th2 cells are poorly represented in atherosclerotic plaques, and their function in atherosclerosis is still controversial. Th2 cells typically produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 can effectively inhibit the Th1 response, Th1 cytokine formation and IFN-γ secretion, and has atheroprotective effects ( The Th17 subset has been identified in atherosclerosis-prone mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques and its role remains controversial ( Tregs are a highly heterogeneous population of CD4 Using scRNA-seq screening methods, Winkels et al. ( B cells are heterogeneous populations of lymphocytes derived from bone marrow and composed of multiple subsets of cells with distinct localization properties, activation requirements, survival characteristics, and immunoglobulin secretion profiles ( B1 cells are intrinsic immune cells that are usually found in plasma membrane cavities such as the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Without the need for Th cells, both B1a and B1b cells can secrete IgM under antigenic stimulation, which specifically binds to LDL oxidizing epitopes in atherosclerotic plaques and reduces lipid uptake by macrophages, thus decreases the formation of foam cells. At the same time, IgM specifically binds to apoptotic cells so that inflammatory cells can be eliminated, thus slowing down atherosclerosis progression ( B2 cells are what we commonly refer to as mature B lymphocytes, produced in the bone marrow and differentiated in secondary lymphoid tissues. Preliminary studies on the role of B2 cells in atherosclerosis have demonstrated their pro-atherogenic effect. The use of a CD20-specific monoclonal antibody to selectively remove B2 cells, but not B1a cells, from  The variety of functions performed by B cells, such as antibody production, cytokine release, and antigen presentation, as well as the unique ways in which B cells adapt to the inflammatory microenvironment of plaques, have led to different B cell subsets exhibiting complex heterogeneity in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. The evolution of atherosclerotic plaques is regulated by both the immune system and inflammatory responses, and the study of immune as well as anti-inflammatory based therapies for atherosclerosis is of great clinical importance. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to IL-1β and blocks the interplay of IL-1β with IL-1R, preventing the inflammatory response from occurring. IL-1β plays multiple roles in the atherosclerotic process, including promoting adhesion of immune cells to vascular endothelial cells, promoting proliferation of VSMCs, and inducing procoagulant activity ( Advances have also been made in the study of antibody immunotherapies targeting other cytokines that play pro-inflammatory roles in plaque evolution, as well as chemokines and their receptors that also have important roles. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, the use of anti-TNF-α antibodies significantly reduced the size of carotid plaques and inhibited plaque development ( Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) mAb has recently been found to exhibit potential therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of atherosclerosis. There are activated subsets of PD-1 Antibody immunotherapy for human atherosclerosis. Antigen-antibody reactions play a pivotal role in the evolution of plaques. Therefore, the use of immunomodulatory strategies to activate immune responses against relevant antigens has the potential to alter the natural course of atherosclerosis. The purpose of vaccination is to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by stimulating the body to produce antibodies that block the target antigen. What has received earlier attention from researchers is LDL-related vaccines. OxLDL is thought to be critical in causing intimal inflammation and foam cell formation in atherosclerosis. One of the most studied is the specific malondialdehyde-modified apolipoprotein B100 (MDA-ApoB100), which is a relatively important oligopeptide fragment of oxLDL molecules with strong antigenicity ( Inflammation is a well-studied therapeutic target, and strategies to control inflammation have been successfully applied against many diseases. After many studies it appears that inflammation has also emerged as an important target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents for atherosclerosis have been extensively studied in recent years. Among the most widely researched and used drugs are statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and are usually used to treat atherosclerosis. They are the drugs of choice for clinical lipid-lowering, with commonly used drugs such as rosuvar, atorval, and simvastatin calcium tablets. Statins exert various anti-inflammatory effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties. Statins can inhibit macrophage growth, reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, downregulate the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines, and prevent monocyte recruitment ( In addition to statins, there are several common anti-inflammatory drugs that are also used to treat atherosclerosis. Colchicine is utilized for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis due to its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity. Its anti-inflammatory mechanism is mainly through downregulation of multiple inflammatory pathways including inhibition of phospholipase A2, reduction of leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2 release from monocytes, inhibition of neutrophil function through microtubule proteins, and reduction of endothelial adhesion, which leads to inhibition of inflammation and increase of plaque stabilization ( Atherosclerosis is defined as an inflammatory disease, with inflammatory responses throughout the disease progression, and inflammatory mediators, cytokines, through inflammatory signaling pathways exerting different roles in the regulation of the plaque inflammatory microenvironment. Many studies have clearly demonstrated that immune responses mediate the entire process of atherosclerotic plaque evolution, including initiation, progression, and thrombotic complications. Crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune pathways strongly regulates plaque activity and progression, while the heterogeneity of immune cells plays a pivotal role in plaque evolution. The evolution of atherosclerosis involves complex interactions of immune cells as well as phenotypic plasticity. Omics studies, especially scRNA-seq, have highlighted the specific transcriptional profiles of various cell lineages at the site of atherosclerotic lesions. The detailed map of the cells revealed not only enhances our understanding of the heterogeneity of different cells in the plaque environment, but also deepens our comprehension of the mechanisms of disease occurrence and progression and provides a solid scientific basis for the development of novel precision therapeutic strategies. By combining high-throughput omics data with experimental studies to analyze the gene expression profiles and functional properties of specific cell subsets, it is possible to develop targeted drugs against specific cell subsets or the immune molecules they produce, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD1 However, the vast majority of investigations into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque pathology have originated from experimental animal models, and there are significant barriers to translating interventions from animal models to the clinic, primarily because mouse models reproduce human atherosclerosis to a very limited extent. It is encouraging that the integration of bioinformatics-, transcriptomics-, and proteomics-based datasets will help us to define the immune profile of human atherosclerosis in a more comprehensive manner. As multidimensional approaches continue to progress, it is expected that the cellular and molecular mediators associated with human atherosclerotic plaques will be characterized in depth, and new potential therapeutic targets will undoubtedly emerge. It is our firm belief that our understanding of immune-mediated processes in atherosclerosis will continue to evolve, and the specific mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque evolution will be further resolved from an immunologic perspective.","['atherosclerosis', 'plaque evolution', 'immune response', 'immune cell heterogeneity', 'inflammatory microenvironment', 'immunotherapy']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Immunology,"""chlamydia"""
11466150,Exploring the mechanism of Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang in the treatment of rosacea via network pharmacology and molecular docking,"Rosacea is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease affecting the center of the face that causes burning and itching sensations and changes in aesthetics. Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) is a classic herbal formulation that is efficacious and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of rosacea; however, the pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of action of LXWHT using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology database was searched to identify the active ingredients and pharmacological targets of LXWHT, and the GeneCard, Disgenet, and Gene Expression Omnibus databases were applied to screen rosacea-related targets. Cytoscape software was used to visualize the protein–protein interaction network, and network topology analysis was used to identify core targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed for the core targets. Molecular docking simulations and visualization were performed using Maestro and PyMOL, respectively. A total of 43 active compounds and 28 potential targets for LXWHT treatment of rosacea were selected for analysis. The Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results indicated that LXWHT may exert therapeutic effects on rosacea by intervening in immune pathways including tumor necrosis factor pathway, interleukin-17 pathways, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Chemokine ligand 2, interferon-γ, interleukin-1ß, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 may be the core therapeutic target. Quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, beta-carotene, baicalein, acetin, and isorhamnetin were predicted to be the key active ingredients. LXWHT may exert therapeutic effects in the treatment of rosacea by modulating immunity and angiogenesis, laying the foundation for further research.","Rosacea is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory dermatological condition that affects the center of the face and manifests as paroxysmal flushing, persistent erythema, papules and pustules, and capillary dilatation; these symptoms are often accompanied by burning and itching, as well as other discomforting sensations. Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) is an effective formula for the clinical treatment of rosacea that consists of the following 5 traditional Chinese medicines: Carthamus tinctorius L. (Hong Hua [HH]), Celosia cristata L. (Ji Guang Hua [JGH]), Campsis grandiflora (Ling Xiao Hua [LXH]), Rosa rugosa Thunb. (Mei Gui Hua [MGH]), and Chrysanthemum indicum L. (Ye Ju Hua [YJH]). According to the traditional theory of Chinese medicine, the formation of rosacea is mainly due to dampness, heat, and blood stasis. The 5 herbs in LXWHT can play the roles of cooling the blood, activating the blood, dispersing wind, and removing toxins. Clinical studies indicate that the application of LXWHT alone or in combination with other agents can significantly reduce the clinical symptoms of rosacea, including facial itching, burning, flushing, and papules, without inducing significant adverse effects. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanisms of action of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea using network pharmacology to screen for the effective ingredients and core targets, as well as molecular docking experiments to verify the interactions between the core targets and the main effective ingredients. Each herbal medicine comprising LXWHT was entered into the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology (TCMSP) database ( The search term “Rosacea” was used to search the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the GSE65914 gene microarray data were selected. The GEO2R online tool was selected to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between rosacea and normal tissues based on fold change and adjusted  The intersection of LXWHT and rosacea target genes was assessed to identify potential targets of LXWHT in the treatment of the disease. More specifically, the herbs, active components, and potential targets of LXWHT were imported into the Cytoscape 3.8.2 software platform (The Cytoscape Consortium, San Francisco), The intersection data of the LXWHT target genes and the rosacea target genes was input into the STRING database ( The intersecting genes were subjected to GO and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analyses and visualized using the GO/KEGG analysis tool v0.2.0 from Hiplot website ( The core proteins were identified from the construction and analysis of the protein interaction networks using the Protein Data Bank ( The active pocket in the molecular docking experiments was defined by the ligands in the core proteins; in cases of proteins without ligands, the active binding sites were defined by the Binding Site Detection module in Schrödinger software, New York City. The binding grid is formed by the Glide module, which uses force-field information to produce frames indicating the possible locations of the ligand centers. The box was generated by directly selecting ligands from a known crystal structure or by simulating the active sites. The protein structure acts as a rigid receptor and each ligand molecule acts as a flexible ligand for semi-flexible docking. Standard Precision mode screening was performed for the docking of key components with defined active pockets, and the binding energy was calculated. Small-molecule ligands and protein receptors were imported into PyMOL 2.4.0 software, (Schrödinger, Inc. New York City) to visualize the molecular docking results. The main active ingredients of the constituents of LXWHT were determined using the TCMSP database based on the oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug-like properties ≥ 0.18 criteria. A total of 43 main active ingredients were obtained from the search: 22 from HH, 12 from YJH, 5 from JGH, 4 from LXH, and 10 from MGH. These results were imported into Cytoscape to construct the “Herb-active Component” (H-C) network diagram of LXWHT, which is depicted in Figure  The “Herb-active Component” (H-C) network diagram of LXWHT. The diamonds represent the herbs comprising LXWHT, whereas the circles represent the active components. HH = Hong Hua, LXWHT = Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang, JGH = Ji Guang Hua, MGH = Mei Gui Hua, YJH = Ye Ju Hua. The TCMSP database was subsequently used to identify the corresponding targets of the active ingredients, which were then imported into the UniProt website and converted into gene symbols. After eliminating duplicate results, 216, 191, 106, 37, and 178 targets were identified for HH, YJH, JGH, LXH, and MGH, respectively. A total of 1070 DEGs were identified in rosacea tissues based on the GSE65914 dataset. We presented these DEGs with heatmaps and volcano plots (Fig.  Demonstration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE65914. (A) Volcano map and (B) Heatmap of DEGs. The Venn diagram identified the overlapping targets between Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) and rosacea. The herbs, active components, and 28 potential therapeutic targets of LXWHT were imported into STRING to construct the “H-C-T” network of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea (Fig.  “Herb-Component-Target” (H-C-T) network of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea.

Network topology analysis was further performed to calculate the degree value of each node in the network, with higher values indicating a closer connection with the surrounding nodes. Quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, beta-carotene, baicalein, acacetin, and isorhamnetin exhibited degree values of 29, 9, 9, 7, 6, 4, 4, 4 and 4, respectively, all of which were higher than the median value; thus, they were considered to be the key active ingredients through which LXWHT alleviates rosacea.

The pathogenesis of rosacea is driven by a variety of factors, and, although the precise mechanisms are unknown, it is generally believed that a local immune imbalance, neurovascular dysfunction, and dermal microflora dysregulation occur mainly in individuals with a genetic susceptibility in response to certain external stimuli. LXWHT is efficacious and has commonly been used in the clinical treatment of various facial erythematous diseases, including rosacea, facial dermatitis, and moderate-to-severe acne. We identified 43 active compounds of LXWHT from the TCMSP database, and 28 putative therapeutic targets were selected based on the overlap between LXWHT-related targets and predicted rosacea targets. Based on the H-C-T network topology analysis, we identified several core compounds, including quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, beta-carotene, baicalein, acetin, and isorhamnetin. Rosacea is a type of inflammatory disease, and many of these identified compounds are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory properties. For example, quercetin, a flavonoid that acts on multiple targets to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, After identifying 28 potential targets of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea, a PPI network was constructed and topologically analyzed using CytoHubba.

In terms of the BP category, enrichment was mainly observed in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, transporter activity, nitric oxide synthase biosynthetic processes, negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, and granulocyte-neutrophil chemotactic migration, among others, suggesting that LXWHT may affect immune responses by interfering with the function and migration of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Nitric oxide biosynthetic processes are part of a classical pathway associated with vasodilator-related processes, which were also enriched, suggesting a potential mode of action of LXWHT. For the core targets in the KEGG analysis, enrichment was mainly observed in the TNF and  Ultimately, the topological analysis of the H-C-T network led to the identification of 5 hub genes ( Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrate that LXWHT, a formulation used in traditional Chinese medicine, may have potential advantages in the treatment of rosacea owing to its anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. However, further in-depth pharmacodynamic studies and molecular mechanism experiments are required to explore the full potential of LXWHT in the clinical treatment of rosacea.","['Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang', 'molecular docking', 'network pharmacology', 'rosacea']",2024-6-28,Medicine,"""chlamydia"""
11465698,Comparative study on the epidemiological characteristics and hazards of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infections among elderly people,"To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and infections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses in hospitalized elderly patients with respiratory tract infections in Suzhou City, China, and to compare the differences in clinical characteristics and economic burden associated with these two infections. In this prospective study, pathogenetic testing and clinical data for hospitalized patients aged 60 years and older with respiratory tract infections were collected in five hospitals through stratified cluster sampling from December 2023 to May 2024. Comparative study on epidemic characteristics, clinical features and costs of cases who infected RSV alone and influenza alone were conducted. Among 1,894 cases included, the RSV positivity rate was 5.91% during the 2023–2024 winter-spring season, while the influenza positivity rate was 9.61%. RSV-B was the predominant subtype of RSV, and influenza A (primarily H3N2) was the dominant strain among the influenza-positive cases. Compared with cases infected influenza virus alone, those infected RSV alone had lower occurrence frequency of fever (18.8% vs. 35.7%,  During the winter and spring months, RSV is the second most common pathogen after influenza virus among older adults hospitalized for respiratory infections in Suzhou, China. Patients infected RSV are more likely to develop complications with lower respiratory tract infections and have higher medical costs than the influenza. RSV infection in the elderly should be emphasized, especially in female patients and diabetic patients. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-024-10048-1."," Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a syndrome characterized by fever, cough, sore throat, and other symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common pathogens [ Globally, the severity and disease burden of RSV in older adults can be comparable to that of influenza [ Therefore, this study conducted a 6-month pathogen surveillance of respiratory tract infections in the elderly in Suzhou City, China, to investigate the prevalence characteristics and proportion of RSV infections among the elderly, compare RSV and influenza virus infections in terms of clinical characteristics and disease burden, elucidate the hazards of RSV-associated respiratory infections on the health of the elderly population, and provide a basis for the development of RSV-associated preventive strategies. In this study, we collected clinical data from elderly patients aged 60 years and older who were hospitalized due to ARI at five hospitals in Suzhou City (Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, The People’s Hospital of SND, Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan) and conducted pathogenicity testing from December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024. The WHO and European case definitions of ARI for RSV infection surveillance were used: acute onset (within 10 days) with symptoms of respiratory infection (at least one symptom: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or runny nose) [ This study was a prospective, multicenter study employing stratified whole cluster sampling. Stratified sampling was conducted by county and district, involving 3 counties in Suzhou (Zhangjiagang City, Changshu City, and Kunshan City) and 2 districts (Wujiang and Huqiu). Hospital-level stratified sampling included 3 tertiary hospitals: Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan; and 2 secondary hospitals: The People’s Hospital of SND and Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital. The sampled hospitals collected and sent samples for testing from all elderly patients hospitalized for acute respiratory infections. See Fig.  Flowchart of the study The study used a self-designed survey form to collect case information, including: (1) demographic information (age, gender); (2) clinical information: clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, date of admission, date of discharge, discharge diagnosis, and hospitalization costs; (3) patient outcomes: including whether the patient died during the hospitalization period, time of death, whether they were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and time of ICU admission; and (4) economic burden: including direct medical costs (comprehensive medical services, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and consumables), direct non-medical costs (transportation and escort costs), and indirect costs (lost labor costs due to patient and family accompaniment). These data were obtained through the hospital information system and patient questionnaires. The questionnaire was developed specifically for this study to assess the epidemiological characteristics, clinical characteristics and disease burden of RSV and influenza in older adults (see Supplementary Material 1 and Supplementary Material 2 for the English version). Respiratory samples (nasal swabs) were collected by local hospital professionals during the study participants’ visits to the clinic or hospitalization, following standard sampling procedures. The samples were placed in tubes containing viral sampling solution and stored in a refrigerator at 2–8℃ (for up to 48 h) or at -20℃ (for up to 1 week). Influenza Novel Coronavirus Respiratory 13 Pathogen Nucleic Acid Test Kit (Fluorescent PCR method) (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co., Ltd.) and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR were used to detect pathogens such as Respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus, Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), Human coronavirus (HCoV, Not including COVID-19), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Enterovirus (EV), and other pathogens. RSV-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Detection of respiratory syncytial viruses A/B (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.). Similarly, Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Subtyping of Human Influenza A Viruses (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.). Excel 2019 software was used to summarize the data, and R 4.3.1 software was applied to process and analyze the data. The study subjects were divided into RSV single and influenza single infection groups for comparison. Continuous variables are presented in mean and standard deviation (SD) and compared by independent-samples t-test. Counting variables are presented in medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and analyzed by Nonparametric test. The chi-square ( From December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024, a total of 1,894 cases of respiratory infections were investigated among the elderly in Suzhou City, with 455 testing positive for pathogens, yielding a positivity rate of 24.0%. Of these, 409 were infected with one pathogen, 42 with two, and four with three. The five pathogens with the highest detection rates were influenza virus (9.61%, 182/1,894), RSV (5.91%, 112/1,894), HRV (3.12%, 59/1,894), SP (2.96%, 56/1,894), and HMVP (1.58%, 30/1,894) (see Fig.  Proportion of pathogenic infections and positive detection of common pathogens of respiratory tract infections among the elderly in Suzhou City, China Among influenza virus infections, single infection accounted for 86.3% (157/182), double infections for 12.1% (22/182), and multiple infections for 1.6% (3/182). For RSV infections, single infection comprised 85.7% (96/112), double infections 11.6% (13/112), and multiple infections 2.7% (3/112) (see Fig.  
 Types of Influenza and RSV infection, and pathogen typing in elderly people in Suzhou City, China Influenza positivity was highest in December and then showed a significant month-to-month decline ( 
 Distribution of the time of onset of RSV and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in older adults The patients in both groups were mainly concentrated in the age group of 70–79 years. The mean age of those infected with RSV alone was 75.4 ± 7.6 years, while that of those infected with influenza virus alone was 75.7 ± 8.1 years. RSV infections were 43.8% (42/96) in males and 56.2% (64/96) in females; influenza infections were 61.1% (96/157) in males and 38.9% (61/157) in females. The proportion of females infected with RSV was greater than that of influenza, and the difference was statistically significant ( Among the underlying diseases, 20.8% (20/96) of RSV-infected and 8.9% (14/157) of influenza-infected patients had diabetes, a difference that was statistically significant ( 
 Basic characteristics of cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)] *Using Fisher's exact probability method The most common symptoms of RSV infection in elderly patients infected with RSV alone at the time of admission were cough (96.9%), followed by sputum production (62.5%), dyspnea (29.2%), fever (18.8%), shortness of breath (18.8%), wheezing (15.6%), runny nose (11.5%), and sore throat (10.4%). The most common symptom of influenza virus infection was cough (94.3%), followed by sputum production (52.9%), fever (35.7%), dyspnea (24.2%), wheezing (21.7%), shortness of breath (14.6%), sore throat (14.0%), and runny nose (13.4%). The proportion of fever was lower in RSV-infected elderly patients (18.8%) compared to those with influenza virus infection (35.7%) ( Comparison of clinical characteristics of hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)] *Using Fisher's exact probability method There was no statistically significant difference between RSV-infected cases and those with influenza virus infection in terms of oxygen saturation, ICU admissions, days of hospitalization, and discharge outcomes (see Table  The direct medical costs were $996.2 (792.0-1324.7) for RSV-infected cases and $841.1(574.5-1335.9) for influenza virus-infected cases, which was statistically higher for RSV infection than for influenza virus infection ( Comparison of hospitalization costs for hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [M(IQR), $] The total economic burden of RSV infection was higher than influenza virus infection ($1019.7 vs. $888.1), and the difference was statistically significant ( During the winter and spring seasons of 2023–2024, respiratory infections among older adults in Suzhou City, China, were predominantly caused by single-pathogen infections, with influenza virus being the most common. Influenza A was the main pathogen, with H3N2 identified as the dominant subtype. This aligns with findings by André Almeida et al., who reported H3N2 as the predominant influenza A subtype in elderly populations [ Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of corresponding NPIs, the rate of respiratory pathogen infections has been significantly impacted [ This study of respiratory pathogen surveillance in older adults over a 6-month period suggests that the health risks of RSV infection in this population cannot be ignored. Results from a population-wide ARI prospective surveillance in China, conducted from 2009 to 2019, showed that RSV ranked 5th among the 8 pathogens monitored, with a det ection rate of 7.4% [ Clinical symptom of RSV infection are similar to those of other viral respiratory pathogens and include cough (more than 90%), nasal congestion and runny nose (22-78%), sore throat (16-64%), and dyspnea (51-93%) [ An interesting finding in this study is that the proportion of females infected with RSV is higher than that of females infected with influenza. A related study indicated that the risk of RSV infection in females may be greater compared to influenza [ The study reported by Hakan Sivgin et al. revealed that heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes were the underlying conditions associated with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization, with all severe cases in their study involving patients with diabetes [ Our study found that the length of hospitalization for RSV was similar to that for influenza, consistent with previous research [ RSV can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly, potentially leading to respiratory failure and high mortality. Studies have shown that over 70% of RSV patients experience severe lower respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute bronchitis [ This study has several limitations. First, monitoring was conducted over a six-month period, and a full year of data collection has yet to be completed. Second, the study population included only individuals aged 60 years and older, excluding those under 60 years. We will continue monitoring to achieve a full year of surveillance and plan to conduct population-wide RSV surveillance in the future. The RSV epidemic in older adults in Suzhou City, China, occurs around the similar time as influenza and accounts for a significant proportion of respiratory infections in this population, with an economic burden comparable to that of influenza virus infection. RSV infections are more likely to lead to more serious lower respiratory complications than influenza infections. Therefore, establishing an RSV surveillance system should be prioritized to better monitor RSV infection in the elderly, particularly those with underlying conditions.

11464204,Understanding the influence of the microbiome on childhood infections,"The microbiome is known to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.","The human microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes – including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea – that have co-evolved with our species for millennia. The number of microbes colonizing our bodies is truly staggering; for instance, infants have an estimated 1.9 trillion human cells but are colonized by more than twice that number of microbial cells, including approximately 4.4 trillion bacterial cells [ At no point across the lifespan is the microbiome as dynamic as during childhood. At birth, infants are colonized by trillions of pioneering microbes from the maternal vaginal, gut, and skin microbiota. Over the ensuing days and months, these microbial communities undergo substantial shifts in composition due to changes in the local microenvironment, environmental exposures, and microbial competition. For instance, shortly after birth, the gut is an aerobic environment typically containing high abundances of facultative anaerobes, including bacteria from the genera  Although recent studies suggest that host genetics influences the microbiota during childhood [ The comparatively few pediatric microbiome studies that have been conducted after infancy suggest that the microbiota continues to develop and mature in response to environmental exposures. In particular, increasing age has consistently been associated with changes in microbiota composition during toddlerhood. During the second and third years of life, the gut microbiota increases in diversity (number of species), and a gradual loss of  Other environmental factors have been associated with alterations to the microbiota during childhood. Among 33 Japanese children, those who attended daycare were less likely to have nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles dominated by the health-associated species  The human microbiota provides protection against infection by preventing colonization and invasion by exogenous pathogens. This important function of the microbiota, referred to as colonization resistance, occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including competition for nutritional sources, production of antimicrobial compounds, alterations of the local microenvironment, and modulation of host immune responses ( Early-life colonization of mucosal surfaces by microbes is critical to immune system development [ The human microbiota continues to modulate immune system function throughout the lifespan. In health, microbiome-host homeostasis is characterized by low levels of inflammation and immune cell recruitment sufficient to create a state that is primed to respond to potential pathogens [ The microbiota influences the development of host immune responses to pathogens through several mechanisms. Commensal microbes can induce host epithelial cells to secrete antimicrobial peptides that target specific pathogens, as well as other commensal species [ With advances in our knowledge of the factors that disrupt microbiome composition during childhood and the role that the microbiota plays in immune development, there has been substantial interest in identifying microbiome characteristics that are associated with infection susceptibility or severity ( Globally, acute respiratory infections cause more than 740,000 child deaths each year [ There are accumulating data that early-life infections alter microbiome composition or function, contributing to differences in colonization resistance and infection susceptibility later in childhood. In a longitudinal study of 114 healthy infants, de Steenhuijsen Piters and colleagues found that asymptomatic viral infections occurring in the first few months of life were associated with a strong upper respiratory mucosal interferon response that coincided with enrichment of the upper respiratory microbiota by genera containing common pathogens ( The severity of respiratory infections is also influenced by upper respiratory microbiota composition. A cross-sectional study of children and adolescents found that a microbiota profile dominated by the putatively beneficial bacterial genera  Substantial evidence links the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric infections and other infections arising from the gut.  Bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality among several vulnerable populations of children. Among premature infants, late-onset sepsis is frequently caused by gut-derived bacteria, and these infections are often preceded by loss of potentially beneficial species from the gut microbiota and an increase in the gut abundance of the BSI-causative strain [ The gut microbiota is also the major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microbes in human populations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which theoretically enables detection of all antibiotic resistance genes present within a sample (referred to as the ‘resistome’), has substantially advanced our ability to study antibiotic resistance during childhood. Several studies of the gut resistome among children have demonstrated that acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs early in life, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment or other recognized risk factors [ Adolescents account for more than half of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States [ The composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota has also been associated with the risk of HIV infection. Women with cervicovaginal microbiomes with low abundances of  The oral microbiome is integral to the pathogenesis of early childhood caries, a condition caused by specific bacteria in the supragingival plaque that create an acidic microenvironment that promotes tooth demineralization and decay. Higher abundances of  With accumulating evidence that the microbiota influences infection risk and severity, there has been substantial interest in the development of microbiome-targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of infections. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, several such interventions have been studied in infants and children. Because the gut microbiota is recognized to play a critical role in the development of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, there has long been interest in modifying the gut microbiota of premature infants through the administration of probiotics. A recent meta-analysis that included 106 randomized controlled trials of more than 25,000 infants concluded that multiple-strain probiotics, especially when combined with prebiotics, were associated with lower incidences of severe necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality, whereas single-strain probiotics combined with lactoferrin were most effective in lowering the incidence of sepsis [ Most studies of probiotics in older children have evaluated these products among children with acute diarrhea or for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or CDI. Probiotic trials conducted among children with diarrheal illnesses have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefit. For instance, in a study of a probiotic containing a strain of the yeast  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used in the management of recurrent CDI for nearly two decades, although use of this procedure in children has been limited until relatively recently. Fortunately, there have been several recent studies demonstrating that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for children with recurrent CDI. For instance, Nicholson and colleagues recently summarized outcomes of 372 patients aged 11 months to 23 years with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT at 18 pediatric health centers between 2004 and 2017 [ Phage therapy, in which viruses that target and kill bacteria (bacteriophages) are used for infection treatment, dates back more than a century; however, there has been renewed interest in phages as a result of rising antibiotic resistance. Few controlled trials of phage therapy have been conducted among children; most notably, a clinical trial of  Vaccines have contributed to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality over the past century and continue to prevent nearly 3 million child deaths each year [ Perhaps the most compelling data supporting an association between the gut microbiota and responses to childhood vaccines comes from experiments conducted in animal models. In a landmark study, Lynn and colleagues demonstrated that infant mice that were exposed to ampicillin and neomycin prior to receipt of inactivated or live vaccines developed inferior vaccine-induced antibody responses [ Findings from clinical studies of the impact of the gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity have demonstrated varied and often conflicting results ( With the recognition that the gut microbiota may influence immune responses to vaccination comes the possibility that targeted modification of the gut microbiota could promote vaccine-elicited immunity. In particular, there has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as vaccine adjuvants. Isolauri and colleagues reported that oral administration of  In conclusion, the human microbiota undergoes marked shifts in composition during early life as a result of environmental exposures. During infancy, these microbes are essential to immune maturation, promoting the generation of protective immune responses to potential pathogens and the development of immune tolerance to commensal microbes and host antigens. Throughout childhood, the commensal microbiota influences the risk and severity of infections through a complex network of microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactions collectively referred to as colonization resistance. This important function of the microbiota influences the risk of many infectious diseases that are common among healthy children and adolescents, including acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, the microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gut-derived BSIs among vulnerable groups of children, including premature infants and pediatric HCT recipients. Data from animal experiments and correlative human studies also suggest that the microbiota influences immune responses to childhood vaccines. Taken together, the studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the substantial influence of the microbiota on infectious diseases during childhood and the enormous potential of microbiome-based therapies to prevent or treat infections and promote vaccine-elicited immunity among children. Our understanding of the influence of the microbiota on childhood infections has advanced remarkably over the past several decades. However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. To date, we know surprisingly little regarding factors that shape microbial communities and their influence on infections outside of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts or in older children and adolescents. For instance, few prior studies have investigated the microbiota of the male reproductive tract and the extent to which it influences the transmission of STIs among adolescents. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of studies of the early life microbiome have focused solely on bacteria, effectively disregarding the potential impact of microbes from other kingdoms on childhood infections. Finally, there is growing recognition that the microbiome field needs to move beyond correlative studies in order to accelerate the development of microbiome-based interventions to prevent or treat infections and other diseases in children. One of the main challenges facing the field is translating what we have learned about the microbiome to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutics for childhood infections. Next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to diagnosing infections. Recently, several commercial laboratories have developed assays that enable detection of clinically relevant microbes in a variety of human samples with a short turnaround time, providing results that can be used to guide clinical decision-making. These sequencing technologies also have the potential to transform the field of infection prevention and control. Multilocus sequence typing, which involves sequencing of only a handful of microbial genes that typically represent less than 1% of the genome, remains a standard approach for the evaluation of healthcare-associated infection clusters [ Since November 2022, the first two microbiota-based human therapeutics for adults with recurrent  As sequencing technologies and analytic methods become increasingly high-throughput and accessible, we anticipate that the study of the child microbiome will advance in several ways over the next 5 years. First, there will be an increase in studies investigating the extent to which fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa influence childhood infections through both microbe-host and microbe–microbe interactions, including interspecies interactions spanning microbial kingdoms. Moreover, we will see a continued shift from simple correlative studies to translational studies that utilize novel experimental models or that integrate data on microbial gene expression, microbial and host metabolites, and host immune responses. Additionally, commercial next-generation sequencing assays will be further validated as diagnostic tools and incorporated into routine clinical practice. Eventually, in time, the pathways for regulatory review and approval will be updated to enable development of an increasingly broad range of microbiome-based therapies that reduce the burden of infectious diseases among children.","['Colonization resistance', 'gastrointestinal microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'respiratory microbiota']",2024-4-12,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,"""chlamydia"""

11460847,The relationship between HIV/AIDS and coronary heart disease: A bibliometric analysis,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a malignant infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV gradually destroys the body’s immune system and weakens the body’s ability to resist diseases. People living with HIV may have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease than people without HIV. A literature retrieval from January 1, 1993 to October 1, 2023 based on the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace6.2.R4, VOSviewer v1.6.19, and Microsoft Excel 2019 were utilized for analyzing the following terms: countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords. There were 1144 articles. The highest number of articles is in the USA, followed by Italy. University of California System, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University were the top 3 most productive institutions with publications in this field of research. Journal of Infectious Diseases ranked first with the highest publications (532 records), followed by Immunology (362 records), and Cardiac Cardiovascular Systems (242 records). Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed antiretroviral therapy, myocardial infarction, and protease inhibitors, etc. Keyword cluster analysis obtained 13 categories, which were roughly divided into 3 themes: (1) cardiovascular disease that has occurred or may occur; (2) HIV acquisitions that have occurred; (3) risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The article obtained the hotspots and trends and provided references for subsequent research. Based on the keyword citation burst detection analysis, we speculated that heart failure, risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, infection, and association were the research hotspots in recent years, which had a certain predictive effect on the future research direction.","Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that severely impairs the function of the immune system. CD4 However, after searching various popular databases, we found considerable literature on the relationship between the risk of HIV/AIDS and CHD. Although some scholars have done literature review studies, Bibliometric analysis studies the relationship between scientific literature and citation. It evaluates the relationship between a scientific research output, influence and academic cooperation through mathematical, statistical methods and provides a scientific decision-making basis through data analysis. Bibliometric analysis studies help researchers understand the dynamics of the academic community and guide research direction and resource allocation. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database is an important database for obtaining global academic information. It contains all articles and citations from the vast majority of journals, ensuring the integrity and systematicity of research in terms of time and content. Therefore, this study intended to use CiteSpace to visually analyze the literature related to the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD in the WoSCC database to explore the main research content and track the research hotspots. Based on the data analysis findings in the literature, we analyze the development dynamics and research trends of HIV/AIDS and CHD correlation research in the international arena, in order to provide a reference for predicting the direction of further research on the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD and to promote the development of effective strategies for preventing and treating CHD in PLHIV. Our study used the most common and popular database for bibliometrics, the WoSCC database( The inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the filters of the WoSCC database. The studies that met the following criteria included: (1) Articles published in the period from January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023; (2) Articles about HIV/AIDS and CHD; (3) Original articles; (4) Published in English. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Duplicate publications; (2) Proceeding paper, editorial material, meeting abstract, book chapters, letters, early access, correction, reprint, and other types. The following basic information was collected for each article: countries, institutions, journals, authors, references, and keywords. Keywords with the same meaning but in different styles were standardized: “coronary-artery disease” was replaced by “coronary heart disease,” and “human immunodeficiency viru” was replaced by “human immunodeficiency virus.” Two researchers strictly screened the literature by examining the abstract section according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The third researcher determined the contents with differences and uncertainties. All documents were imported into EndNote X9 for document de-duplication and management. The above plain text files were imported into CiteSpace 6.2.R4 software and VOSviewer v1.6.19 software. CiteSpace is an academic literature analysis tool with an advanced visualization feature, which has the advantage of in-depth mining of academic research. It is able to extract burst terms and reveal the hotspots, developments trends and evolutionary paths of academic research. Compared with CiteSpace, VOSviewer more intuitively displays the relationship between network data and realizes the purpose of speedily gaining a comprehensive picture of research topics. In the knowledge map generated by CiteSpace, research projects were presented, including countries, institutions, authors, keywords, etc. VOSviewer mapped the scientific network of co-citation analysis. Each research project represents a node. The larger the node, the larger the number of papers published, the number of citations, the frequency of occurrence, and other related indicators. The connection between the nodes represents the relationship of cooperation, co-occurrence, and citation. The network map analysis demonstrates the nodes’ research level and capabilities and shows the cooperative relationship between each node. The timezone shows research trends based on the network map in the form of a timeline. Reference co-citation cluster analysis reflected and summarized the main content of the research field. The research themes of HIV/AIDS and CHD are interpreted by co-occurrence analysis of keywords, cluster analysis of Ridgeline Plot, and emergence analysis over the past 30 years. The trend of literature publication in the past 30 years was plotted using Microsoft Excel 2019. All data were available on a public database. Therefore, permission was not required from the ethics committee. From January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023, the final search results had 1144 literature records, and the search process is shown in Figure  A searching flow diagram. The distribution trend chart from January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023. In CiteSpace software, the Node Type is “Country,” with 1144 articles from 70 countries. The mapping of the country’s cooperation network is shown in Figure  Ranking of top10 country of articles numbers. Mapping of country cooperation networks. From January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023, a total of 988 institutions were involved in research on the association between HIV/AIDS and CHD. The number of papers published by scientific research institutions can represent their research ability and research level in this field. The top 15 universities or institutions in the number of publications are almost all in the United States, as shown in Table  Ranking of top15 universities and institutions of article numbers. We obtained 377 authors while selecting “Author” for the parameter of Node Types and set the G-index to 10. When selecting Authors with “a count ≥3,” which represents the number of published papers more than 3, we obtained a total of 134 authors. According to the number of publications by the author and the cooperative relationship between the author and other authors, the author’s timezone map is drawn with time as the main line, as shown in Figure  Author’s timezone map. Through the statistics of relevant research publishing institutions from 1993 to 2023, a total of 65 journals were included in the study, and the list of the top 10 journals with the number of publications is shown in Table  Ranking of top10 publications and journals of article numbers. In addition, among the 1144 literature records, the ranking of the top 10 cited articles is shown in Table  Ranking of top10 citation articles. Co-citation analysis of cited documents of related research was conducted in VOSviewer software, and a total of 23,676 cited literature was obtained. Setting the Minimum number of citations of a cited reference to 20 times, the map of co-cited documents with 218 thresholds is obtained in the VOSviewer, as shown in Figure  Network map of reference co-citation.

This study conducts a literature search and statistical analysis on the WoSCC database on the correlation between HIV/AIDS and CHD. A total of 1144 relevant literature were obtained, to a certain extent, they reflect the research trends and hotspots in HIV/AIDS and CHD. This research field primarily focuses on the cardiovascular diseases that have occurred or may occur in PLHIV, the existing late-stage HIV infection, and the influencing factors of cardiovascular diseases, etc, which indicates that this research field is popular in the era of CHD. According to the distribution map of the 30-year publication trend, the number of papers published increased rapidly from 1993 and peaked in 2012. The number of papers published fluctuated up and down around a stable value between 2012 and 2023. Accompanying the increase in ART coverage and the decline in mortality from HIV-related illnesses, non-HIV-related illnesses, mainly CHD, have gradually become the leading cause of death among PLHIV. The number of publications and citations of research results reflect the scientific research strength and depth of different countries, institutions and universities. In terms of the number of publications, the United States has an absolute advantage. Ranking each research institution and university according to the number of publications, the University of California System has the largest number of publications, followed by Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University. As the top 10 research institutions and universities are all from the United States, it indicates that the United States has far more research investment in this field than other countries. The scientific research strength and economic capacity of the United States are relatively strong. In terms of the average citations of the articles, Denmark is the most prominent, which may be related to the 3 highly cited articles by the author Friis-Moller, N. The timezone map is drawn with the authors’ appearance time and published papers, hence it can reflect the changing trend of the research field. Mapping based on the timing of the first publication and the number of publications by the authors revealed a small break in 2004, which is consistent with our publication trend map. Around 2012, the first appearance rate of authors in this field exploded, which indicating that they laid a solid foundation for the development of research in the next 10 years. Grinspoon, Steven K and his team have the greatest number of publications. They suggest that PLHIV on long-term combination antiretroviral therapy, especially protease inhibitors, have an increased incidence of myocardial infarction, even if treatment of PLHIV is more important than the risk of myocardial infarction. Friis-Moller, N and his group have the highest time cited. Among the first 10 articles, the Friis-Moller, N team occupied 3 articles, namely the first article, Keywords reflect the core research content of academic papers, and high-frequency keywords can reflect the research hotspots and trend evolution in this field. Therefore, keyword analysis is the most essential part of literature analysis. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was used to analyze the hot research directions in the field of HIV/AIDS and CHD in the past few years and reflected the current or future research hotspots and trends. By combining with the results of keyword burst detection analysis, it is reasonable to infer that the current research hotspots are heart failure, risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, and association. Heart failure is the most serious manifestation of CHD. An increasing number of studies have proved that HIV is an important factor in expanding the incidence of heart failure, In addition, through the cluster analysis of keywords, we obtained 13 categories. This study generalizes and summarizes the clustering results, which can be divided into 3 themes. The first theme is cardiovascular disease that has arisen or may occur. PLHIV have a higher risk of these diseases than people without HIV. Table  Cluster analysis of keywords and top 5 keywords in the 13 clusters. Similar to other bibliometric articles, there are 3 limitations of this study: the first one is that only the WoSCC database was used; the second one is the language was limited to English; the third one is article type was limited to the article, which may lead to missing data in some literature. In addition, some authors’ institutions and universities may have changed, resulting in the dispersion of research results, which may have affected the analysis results to some extent. Future research can further expand the database. Based on 2 bibliometric analysis tools, CiteSpace and VOSviewer, this study explored the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD. We analyzed and summarized this research topic’s development process and hot trends. In recent years, HIV/AIDS has become a global public health problem, and CHD-related diseases are the critical factors in the death of PLHIV.

11459521,Excessive or sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress: one of the culprits of adipocyte dysfunction in obesity,"As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise globally, the research on adipocytes has attracted more and more attention. In the presence of nutrient overload, adipocytes are exposed to pressures such as hypoxia, inflammation, mechanical stress, metabolite, and oxidative stress that can lead to organelle dysfunction. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle for sensing cellular pressure, and its homeostasis is essential for maintaining adipocyte function. Under conditions of excess nutrition, ER stress (ERS) will be triggered by the gathering of abnormally folded proteins in the ER lumen, resulting in the activation of a signaling response known as the unfolded protein responses (UPRs), which is a response system to relieve ERS and restore ER homeostasis. However, if the UPRs fail to rescue ER homeostasis, ERS will activate pathways to damage cells. Studies have shown a role for disturbed activation of adipocyte ERS in the pathophysiology of obesity and its complications. Prolonged or excessive ERS in adipocytes can aggravate lipolysis, insulin resistance, and apoptosis and affect the bioactive molecule production. In addition, ERS also impacts the expression of some important genes. In view of the fact that ERS influences adipocyte function through various mechanisms, targeting ERS may be a viable strategy to treat obesity. This article summarizes the effects of ERS on adipocytes during obesity.","Obesity is one of the most prevalent health issues in modern society, which places a heavy burden on society. The main feature of obesity is the expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) accompanied by dysfunction, which is caused by a long-term imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. WAT is a major storage for excess energy and an endocrine organ, containing subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle that has the function of synthesizing, folding, and transporting proteins, as well as being responsible for lipid synthesis and calcium homeostasis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive metabolites such as free fatty acid (FFA) derived from WAT enter the bloodstream and flow to other organs, bringing about metabolic damage to tissues and eventually progressing to various complications, such as NAFLD, cardiovascular diseases, and T2DM. During obesity, the inflammatory response of adipocytes is dependent or independent of ERS. Inflammation, ERS, and lipolysis in adipocytes can form malignant interactions. The inflammatory response is the downstream of ERS. Inflammatory cytokines can exacerbate ERS and promote adipocyte lipolysis, releasing excessive FFA, which in turn enhances adipocyte inflammatory response and ERS, starting a vicious cycle. The ER is rich in chaperones and oxidoreductases that control proper protein folding and ER-related degradation of abnormally folded proteins. The lipotoxic of FFA and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt the redox state of the ER, increasing the frequency of abnormally folded proteins. Human, mouse or cell models of ERS-related lipolysis. ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum stress. ERS has been considered an important mechanism of obesity-related IR. GLUT4 is an insulin-responsive glucose transporter. When insulin binds to its receptor, it starts a series of events that cause GLUT4 to transfer from the intracellular chamber and insert into the plasma membrane. Except for storing excess energy, WAT is also an active endocrine tissue that secretes bioactive molecules, including unique adipokines and conventional cytokines. Secretory profile of hypertrophic adipocytes is shifted toward the pro-inflammatory spectrum. Effect of ERS on the expression of bioactive molecules. ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum stress. Apart from adipokines, ERS alters the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes during obesity. ERS is associated with adipocyte apoptosis. Huang et al. reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) induced apoptosis of grass carp adipocytes through ERS, and B-cell lymphoma-2-related ovarian killer (BOK) may be an important link between ERS and apoptosis. BOK is considered to be a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, handling the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. DHA significantly increased the transcript of BOK, which was blocked by the ERS inhibitor. There is a cross-talk between the ER and mitochondria, which are closely linked both physically and functionally. ERS adjusts the expression of some important genes in adipocytes. PPARα is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates genes associated with lipid metabolism, and PPARα expression is reduced in WAT of obese mice. Inhibiting ERS could be a therapeutic intervention against the morphological and functional alterations of overall adipose tissue depots in obesity. The ERS inhibitor TUDCA, as a bile acid conjugated to taurine with chemical chaperone activity, has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to minimize obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction and metabolic disorders. TUDCA has been approved by the US administration for clinical application of cholelithiasis and cholestatic liver disease. Thus, TUDCA treatment may also be a feasible therapeutic agent for obesity management. Since ERS in adipose tissue is primarily afflicted by obesity, the development of novel treatments for obesity may provide new insights into mitigating ERS. Although pharmacological inhibitors of ERS have therapeutic potential as new targets for metabolic diseases, obesity is adjusted by multiple factors and variables, making it a highly complicated disease for which a single therapeutic approach is usually less effective. The current lifestyle management strategies such as caloric restriction and physical activity are often inadequate. In addition to lifestyle changes, treatments for obesity generally include pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. On a global scale, the gradual increase in the prevalence of obesity over the past several decades is regarded as a serious threat to public health. The rising obesity epidemic and its related complications have made adipocytes an important topic of scientific research and a target for therapeutic intervention. The ER controls the correct folding of peptides and proteins through a variety of chaperones and enzymes on its membrane. When the overloaded protein folding exceeds the processing capacity, the ER folding process will be disordered, leading to the accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and ultimately triggering ERS. With the progression of obesity, excessive or sustained ERS disrupts adipocyte functions, including lipolysis, IR, apoptosis, bioactive molecule production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impacting the expression of some important genes, thereby affecting WAT ( The effects of ERS on the hypertrophic adipocyte.

11457904,Self-reported sexually transmitted infections and associated risk factors among female university students,"The spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an ongoing public health challenge, and awareness of risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive interventions. This study aimed to assess self-reported STI occurrences and identify risk factors and sexual behaviors associated with STIs among female university students. This is a cross-sectional, online questionnaire study, including 384 female university students seeking contraceptive counseling at a gynecology clinic in Uppsala, Sweden, and reporting having had sex. Associated risk factors and behaviors were assessed by comparing those who reported STIs and those who did not. The mean age of participants was 22.8 years. Seventy-eight (20%) had contracted at least one STI, with seven (9%) experiencing multiple infections. Seventy-three (94%) reported first-date sexual activity without a condom among STI experienced. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most common STI pathogen (68% of all infections), followed by Herpes simplex virus (18%) and Mycoplasma genitalium (13%). Behavioral factors associated with self-reported STIs were first-date sexual activity without a condom, not using condom at first intercourse, younger age at first intercourse, a higher number of sexual partners overall and in the last 12 months, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regretting sexual activity after substance use ( Condom use was low among the respondents, and STIs were common regardless of the high level of education in this group. Contraceptive counseling needs to highlight the importance of condom use in addition to contraceptive efficacy. It is also essential to consider the specific risk factors and behaviors prevalent among young adults to reduce the spread of STIs.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a common problem worldwide and present various challenges regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prevention in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Most STIs are not life-threatening, but they can still lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and fetal and neonatal morbidity ( University students can be considered especially vulnerable to contracting an STI, as partying, including binge drinking and recreational drug use, is a common and normalized behavior in campus culture ( Studies about sexual behavior and the use of contraceptives among female university students in Uppsala have been conducted regularly since 1989 ( Uppsala is a Swedish university city with about 50,000 students. Swedish-speaking women who visited an outpatient gynecology clinic for contraceptive counseling were asked to participate. Data collection took place between February and June 2023. Previously, only university students could visit this clinic, which was designated as the student healthcare clinic. From 2014 onward, it became open to all women. When attending the clinic, women were invited to participate and received information about the study along with a QR link to the survey. The survey was conducted via REDCap ( No ethical permission was needed since the study participants were anonymous, and no sensitive personal information could be linked to any individual (advisory opinion, Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 219-04587). Since this was a follow-up study, the questionnaire was mostly identical to those used in previous studies ( Statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 29.0.2.0) and R (version 4.2.3). Continuous and discrete variables were analyzed using T-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U-test for skewed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test when there were too few observations for Pearson’s chi-square test. Proportions of STIs are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Clopper-Pearsons exact CIs. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and testing multiple characteristics, we set the level of statistical significance at 0.003 in accordance with the Bonferroni correction method (0.05/20 = 0.0025 ≈ 0.003). In total, 599 persons answered the questionnaire. As this study focuses on university students, those who stated that they worked, went to upper secondary school, or did not answer the question about occupation were excluded from further analyses. In addition, we only included participants reporting having had sex. Thus, 384 women studying at the university remained, and the background characteristics of these are presented in  Background characteristics of study participants ( Out of the 384 study participants, 78 (20%, 95% CI 16.4 – 24.7%) had experienced at least one STI, and seven (9%, 95% CI 3.7 – 17.6%) of them reported a history of more than one STI. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most commonly occurring STI; see  Self-reported STI pathogens among female university students ( The percentage of STI pathogens adds up to 106.3% because seven females reported more than one pathogen Characteristics and sexual behavior related to STI status among female university students. Among those who reported having had anal sex ( Comparison of those who have had an STI with those who have not T-test, Pearson’s chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test Of the respondents, 20% had experienced an STI, and 9% of these had experienced multiple STIs. Both of these estimates were nominally lower than in the previous survey from 2014, when 26% reported one STI and 17% of these reported multiple STIs ( It is possible that the tendency toward a reduction in STI occurrence can be partly explained by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sweden, the Public Health Agency issued recommendations such as limiting close contacts and keeping a distance from others to limit the spread of the virus ( A significant difference in the number of sexual partners was observed between women with and without experience of an STI, with more sexual partners in the STI group, in line with previous studies ( Dating app usage and meeting sexual partners online have been associated with sexual risk behavior ( Among those who reported experiencing an STI, it was more than twice as common to report having ‘regretted sexual activity after substance use’ compared to those without STI experience. Finally, considering the risk of contracting an STI, it is worrying that more than half of all students and almost all the students in the STI group have experienced first-date sexual activity without a condom. As recruitment took place at a gynecology clinic, our study does not capture those using only condom and hence not needing an appointment to obtain a prescription. This might affect the low rate of condom use. However, condom use is always recommended with new partners despite the use of other contraceptives. It cannot be excluded that the low numbers are also affected by impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption, as one-night stands often occur after a night out. However, non-use of condom was not statistically significantly associated with STIs in all situations. This suggests that other risk behaviors besides sex without a condom are more important for STI risk, as one can behave responsibly, for example, by getting tested before having sex with a new partner and therefore not using a condom. With its cross-sectional design, this study only provides information on associations between known variables. Nonetheless, it is a good-sized sample from a clearly defined population and offers valuable insights into factors associated with STIs among university students. We also set a conservative significance level, safeguarding against false positives and overinterpretation of the results. Additionally, the high internal response rate further strengthens the study. All recruited participants attended the same gynecological clinic, which may indicate a certain sociodemographic group and cause selection bias. On the other hand, the clinic’s central location and popularity among students facilitated effective recruitment. Condom-only users rarely visit a clinic for contraceptive counseling, which may also contribute to selection bias. Participation in the study was anonymous, which we considered important to minimize the risk of social desirability bias, as most of the questions were on sensitive topics. A potential downside of anonymity is that we could not examine the representativeness of the sample, and there is a risk of non-response bias if those who declined participation represent a specific group. Furthermore, all the data collected were self-reported retrospectively, making recall bias likely to some extent since a person’s ability to accurately recall past events deteriorates with time. The reliability of self-reported diagnoses depends on many factors, including the type of condition, question design, and participant understanding. With self-reported diagnoses, it is impossible to know if the person truly had the disease and had it verified by healthcare professionals or merely self-diagnosed. Particularly in the case of STIs, which carry stigma, accurate reporting may be further compromised. Altogether, this might contribute to an underestimated STI occurrence. This study’s findings contribute to the existing literature on STIs and sexual risk behaviors, which is crucial for designing preventive measures and promoting sexual health among young adults. Despite efforts to prevent STIs, poor condom use remains a persistent problem, especially among dating app users and those under the influence of alcohol. While this study does not delve into the reasons behind the lack of condom use, further research in this area is essential to identify specific barriers and develop targeted interventions. Future studies should continue to monitor STI occurrence beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as the digital age and widespread use of dating apps may change people’s sexual habits and behaviors. The identified risk factors and behaviors for contracting an STI included younger age at first intercourse, a greater number of sexual partners, not using condom at first intercourse, first-date sexual activity without a condom, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regret of sexual activity after substance use. Despite the high level of education in this group, there was a worrying occurrence of STIs and a lack of condom use, especially under the influence of alcohol.

This study aimed to examine the differences in experiences of physical, social, and psychological harms, as well as mental ill-health among GBMSM who use different combinations of methamphetamine and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL) during chemsex. Adult GBMSM participants who had experience of chemsex in the past 12 months participated in a cross-sectional online survey in Taiwan and self-reported their sociodemographic background, sexual behaviours, mental health, and experiences of harm following a chemsex session. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess the different experiences of harm and mental ill-health among GBMSM who engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and who used both drugs. Out of 510 participants who completed all items included in the analysis, 24.1% engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, 36.9% used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and 39.0% used both drugs. Eighty five percent of men who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL reported at least one kind of social harm after a chemsex session, such as missing dates or appointments, or appearing “high” at work, followed by used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL (69.7%) and those without using methamphetamine (37.4%). After controlling for polydrug and frequency of drug use in the multivariable logistic regression, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing physical and psychological harms compared to those who did not use methamphetamine ( GBMSM who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in a chemsex context were more likely to report experience of harms than those who only used a single chemsex drug or engaged in chemsex without methamphetamine or GHB/GBL. Harm reduction should focus on both preventing HIV and STI transmission and on minimising psychosocial harm to GBMSM, with varying impacts depending on drug use.","Chemsex is a form of sexualized drug use, broadly defined by the use of methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL), or mephedrone during or before sexual activities to enhance sexual pleasure or performance in gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM) [ Most studies have taken a broad approach to examining chemsex practices, often analyzing drug use as a single group without adequately exploring individual substances or focusing solely on polydrug use without examining potential synergistic interactions. Some studies have focused on only a single chemsex drug, such as methamphetamine or GHB/GBL [ Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL act differently upon the central nervous system (CNS) and can be associated with different harms, possibly due to their pharmacological properties [ Given the different characteristics of methamphetamine and GHB/GBL, as outlined above, it is necessary to separately examine the association of these two main drugs of chemsex with mental health and harms. This paper examines the following: (1) differences in the sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and reported STI diagnoses, and (2) differences in physical, social, and psychological experiences of harm associated with chemsex for GBMSM who use GHB/GBL and/or methamphetamine. The Chemsex Online Survey for Men who Have Sex with Men in Taiwan (COMeT) was an anonymous cross-sectional online study that investigated the characteristics of harm in chemsex scenarios among GBMSM in Taiwan [ All participants reported whether they had engaged in chemsex or sexualized-related drug use in the past 6 months with any of the following substances: MDMA, prescribed sedative drugs (such as Stilnox), amyl nitrite, erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs, ketamine, methamphetamine, 5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-meo), alcohol, marijuana, mephedrone, GHB/GBL, cocaine, and “coffee-pack” (a pack of mixed substances with unknown ingredients). Participants were originally categorised into four groups based on their use (+) or not use (−) of methamphetamine (M) and/or GHB/GBL (G) in the past 6 months: M−G−, M−G+, M+G− and M+G+. Given that the proportion of M﻿−G+ participants ( Polydrug use was defined as the use of drugs excluding methamphetamine, GHB/GBL, alcohol, and ED drugs from the list of drugs in the survey. Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were excluded due to multicollinearity. The frequency of using methamphetamine or GHB/GBL was assessed in separate questions by asking how often they used methamphetamine or GHB/GBL on a nine-point Likert scale from “daily” to “never.” We included age (20–29, 30–39, and > 39 years old), education (college or below, college graduate, and above college), and monthly income (< 15 kilos [K] New Taiwan dollars [NTD], 15–30 K NTD, and > 30 K NTD; 1 United States dollar [USD] ≅ 30 NTD). We asked each participant to report the number of sexual partners they had in the previous 12 months and categorised them as < 3, 3–5, 6–9, or > 9 partners. We also asked about their frequency of using condoms in a chemsex context in the past three months and categorised them as inconsistent (i.e., not always) and consistent (i.e., always). We combined the self-reported status of HIV and PrEP uptake in the past three months in a single variable and categorised it as HIV negative on PrEP, HIV negative but not on PrEP, and HIV positive. Self-reported STIs in the past 12 months, including gonorrhea, syphilis, anal and penile warts, genital herpes, amoebic colitis, chlamydia, shigellosis, and hepatitis virus infection (including type A, B, and C virus) were categorised into none and any. All participants were asked whether they had experienced a range of issues following a chemsex session and were presented with a 17-item checklist. Items were categorised into physical (such as eating problems or missing PrEP or HIV drugs), social (such as having difficulty getting out of bed or absence from work, etc.), and psychological (such as auditory hallucination or paranoid, etc.) experiences. We included four indicators of mental health: mood-related problems, suicide ideation, loneliness, and sexual well-being. Mood-related problems was measured by the Taiwan version of the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5, Cronbach’s alpha: 0.77–0.90) on a scale of 0–4 [ We conducted chi-square tests for descriptive statistics (including frequencies and proportions) to compare different mixed drugs groups (M−, M+G−, and M+G+) on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, the status of STIs, experiences of harm after a chemsex session and mental health. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations among different mixed drug groups and experiences of harm after a chemsex session. We set the alpha level at 0.05 and adjusted the alpha level for the multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni’s method (altered alpha level = original alpha divided by the number of dependent variables). All data were analysed by Intercooled STATA software version 15.0 (College Station, TX). A total of 918 participants met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the online survey, we deleted duplicated answers ( The sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, HIV status, and STIs among different GBMSM chemsex groups HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; STIs, sexually transmitted infections; GBMSM, gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men; M−, chemsex individuals who did not use methamphetamine in the past six months; M+G−, chemsex individuals who use methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL in the past six months; M+G+, chemsex individuals who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in the past six months; NTD, New Taiwan Dollar; K, kilo dollar; PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis The three groups showed a significant difference in sexual behaviour and in terms of reported HIV status or experience of STI diagnosis ( Half of the participants were living with diagnosed HIV (50.0%), 12% were HIV negative on PrEP, and 38% were not on PrEP. The M+G+ group included the highest proportion of people living with HIV (61.8% compared with 26.0% in M﻿− and 53.2% in M+G−) and the highest proportion on PrEP (15.1% compared with 12.2% in M− and 8.5% in M+G−). Nearly half of the participants (44.7%) had experienced at least one STI diagnosis in the last 12 months, excluding HIV (M+G+: 59.3%, M+G−: 44.7%, and M﻿−: 21.1%). Tables  The comparisons of harm experiences and mental health among different GBMSM chemsex groups GBMSM, gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men; M−, chemsex individuals who did not use methamphetamine in the past six months; M+G− chemsex individuals who use methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL in the past six months; M+G+, chemsex individuals who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in the past six months; PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus * Logistic regression analysis on harm experiences and mental health among different GBMSM chemsex groups GBMSM, gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval; M﻿−, chemsex individuals who did not use methamphetamine in the past six months; M+G﻿−, chemsex individuals who use methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL in the past six months; M+G+, chemsex individuals who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in the past six months * In multivariable analysis (Table  Loneliness and sexual well-being showed no difference among the three groups. Even though suicidal ideation and mood-related problems were significant in univariable analysis comparing M+G+ and M−, they were not significant in Models 2 and 3 when polydrug use and frequency were further adjusted (see Table  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to distinguish and compare the profile of harm and mental health among GBMSM who engage in mixed patterns of chemsex drug use (i.e., methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL). The users of methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL showed no difference in their sociodemographic characteristics but there were differences in sexual behaviour, HIV status, and the recent diagnosis of an STI. Even after controlling for polydrug, frequency of drug use, and other potentially confounding variables, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing different categories of harm compared to those who did not use methamphetamine. Mental health, loneliness, suicidal ideation and sexual well-being were not different among the three drug combination groups in multivariable analysis. GBMSM in the M+G+ group were most likely to report almost all kinds of harm following a chemsex session. Moreover, the risk of experiencing every kind of harm followed a decreasing gradient from GBMSM in the M+G+, M+G−, and M− groups. Our findings revealed that people who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were most likely to report nearly every kind of harm after a chemsex session. Studies have found that the simultaneous use of drugs with opposite mechanisms (i.e., using CNS stimulant with CNS depressant) was associated with more toxic drug interactions than using a single drug, such as using ketamine with caffeine, using cocaine with alcohol, or using cocaine with heroin (also known as “Speedball”) [ It is worth noting that we found significant differences between M+G+ and M− in each type of harm after we further controlled for polydrug and frequency of using drug. This may reflect that beyond the effects of polydrug and frequency, the pattern of using drugs (i.e., using both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL) itself was still one of the important factors that was associated with different kinds of harm. On the other hand, the physical and psychological harm between M+G− and M− was still significant after controlling for polydrug and the frequency of using drug, but the social harm is no longer significant after controlling for the frequency. This may reflect that physical and psychological harm are related to the pattern of drug use (i.e., using methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL); however, social harm, which has a wider impact, may be partly explained by the frequency of using a drug rather than the type of drug use or polydrug. Although one study showed that polydrug and methamphetamine use were both associated with high risk of HIV infection and condomless sex [ Research has documented an association between the use of methamphetamine or GHB/GBL and condomless sex with nonsteady partners [ There were some limitations in this study. First, participants in this study were recruited through one specific popular app used by GBMSM in Taiwan. This might potentially lead to missing those who engaged in chemsex on other apps or channels. Second, our study sample included very few people of M−G+; however, this might reflect the actual situation of the Taiwanese GBMSM chemsex population. Since we merged M−G+ and M−G− into the M− group, it was hard to detect the distinct profile of harm experiences and mental health of those in the M−G+ group. Future studies may make extra effort to recruit more M−G+ users. Third, there might still exist some confounding variables that were not assessed in this study, such as participants' specific psychiatric diagnosis, which could affect their profiles on harm experiences and mental health. Fourth, we did not know for sure whether men were using the mixture of GHB and methamphetamine on the occasion that they experienced harms after the chemsex session. Future study should collect information at the event level and context of the chemsex. For example, a recent study found that in a cohort of young sexual minority men, same-day use of methamphetamine use was most commonly occurred with cannabis and GHB [ Research studies have rarely discussed the social harm following a chemsex session. Most studies about chemsex-related social harms have taken a relatively general, sociological, or macroscopic perspective and focused on the social stigma or damage to relationships [ Our study revealed that the profile of harm and mental health varied among groups of GBMSM who engaged in chemsex using different combinations of drugs. Typologies of drug use and mixed usage may be key factors differentiating the experience of harm and the interventions that are required to support GBMSM towards safer drug use.","['Gay-bisexual-and-other-men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM)', 'Chemsex', 'Methamphetamine', 'Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)', 'Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)', 'Harm reduction']",2024-10-7,Harm Reduction Journal,"""chlamydia"""

ANE predominantly affects children, with most reported cases attributed to viral infections. However, instances of bacterial-induced ANE are infrequent. Here, we present a case of adult-onset ANE associated with bacterial infection. The patient exhibited a hyperinflammatory state following a urinary tract bacterial infection, with neurological function rapidly declining into a coma as the illness progressed. Gram culture of blood suggested  This case underscores the occurrence of ANE triggered by bacterial infection, expanding our understanding of the pathogens associated with this condition. It suggests that ANE may be an immune-mediated disorder rather than solely an infectious disease.","Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a distinct form of acute encephalopathy typically triggered by acute infections, predominantly viral in nature. ANE predominantly affects children under 6 years old. It is characterized by rapid neurological deterioration, presenting symptoms such as coma, seizures, or focal neurological deficits, typically within days of a preceding infection, without evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection [ A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to a disturbance of consciousness following a fever. Upon admission, she was intubated and scored a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3/15 (E1V1M1). Initially, she experienced chills and fever, followed by two days of nausea and vomiting, along with dizziness, cyanosis, and impaired consciousness. No cough, hemoptysis, gastrocnemius tenderness, and conjunctival congestion was complained. She presented to the nearest hospital with a temperature of 41 °C and required emergency intubation to support her breathing. She has never experienced seizures. She had a history of kidney stones and had been experiencing lower back pain prior to this episode. Beyond that, there are no significant past medical history including febrile seizure during childhood or family history. She lives in the city, and her living environment is very good. The patient’s family denies any history of toxic exposure. On the fifteenth day of her illness, she was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU). Upon examination, numerous ecchymoses were observed throughout her body, along with yellow discoloration of the skin. Neurological evaluation revealed bilaterally diminished direct and indirect light reflexes, with absent corneal reflexes. Additionally, bilateral Babinski signs were positive.

11456218,Modulation of Inflammation in McCoy Cells by Zinc Nanoparticles Conjugated With β-Chitosan,"Introduction: This study investigated biosynthetically derived β-chitosan-derived zinc nanoparticles (β-Ch-Zn NPs) for their potential anti-inflammatory properties on McCoy cells. β-Ch-Zn NPs were synthesized using a green chemistry approach, and their characterization confirmed successful synthesis, appropriate size, and morphology. The study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs and their effects on inflammatory responses in McCoy cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: β-Ch-Zn NPs were synthesized and characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm their structural and morphological properties. The cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at various concentrations to determine safe doses for subsequent experiments. To induce inflammation, McCoy cells were pretreated with β-Ch-Zn NPs at different concentrations before LPS stimulations. Gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of proinflammatory cytokine. Results: FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and XRD confirmed the successful synthesis of β-Ch-Zn NPs with the desired size and morphology. The MTT assay demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs, indicating safety for cellular studies. Pretreatment with β-Ch-Zn NPs significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The nanoparticles effectively downregulate proinflammatory cytokines and promote anti-inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by the significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, hypoxia-inducible factor, and nuclear factor kappa B expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects in McCoy cells. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of β-Ch-Zn NPs for treating inflammatory conditions and support further investigation into their in vivo efficacy and safety.","Inflammation is a fundamental biological response to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is a protective mechanism involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells, and establish tissue repair. While acute inflammation is crucial for healing and recovery, chronic inflammation is associated with various diseases, including arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, managing and controlling inflammation is crucial to treating these conditions. Recent advantages in nanotechnology have opened new avenues for developing innovative anti-inflammatory agents. In inflammatory diseases, nanoparticles can be descended to deliver unimplemented drugs directly to the affected tissues, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing systemic side effects. Additionally, nanoparticles can be engineered to modulate human responses. They can be cotton swabs infused with liquids that interact with specific receptors on immune cells, thereby influencing cell activation and cytokine release. This targeted approach can help control excessive inflammation and promote the resolution of chronic inflammatory conditions [ Incorporating metal nanoparticles, such as zinc, into β-chitosan matrices can further enhance its biological properties. Zinc is an essential trace element involved in numerous biological processes, including enzyme function, protein synthesis, and cell division. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have been extensively studied for their antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. ZnONPs have shown promise in modulating inflammatory responses, partly due to their ability to influence the production and activity of cytokines, which are key mediators of inflammation. Moreover, zinc's antioxidant properties help scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to exacerbate inflammatory responses [ Despite the promising potential of β-Ch-Zn NPs, several gaps remain in our understanding. While ZnONPs have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, the specific mechanisms through which β-Ch-Zn NPs exert these effects, particularly in an in vitro model, are not yet fully elucidated. Specifically, there is a need to explore how β-Ch-Zn NPs modulate proinflammatory cytokines, influence key signaling pathways involved in inflammation, and impact oxidative stress markers [ The cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs will be evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which measures cell viability based on the reduction of a tetrazolium compound to formazan by metabolically active cells. This assay provides an initial assessment of the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles and helps to determine the appropriate concentration range for subsequent anti-inflammatory studies, ensuring that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic at the concentrations used for anti-inflammatory studies. Ensuring that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic at the concentrations used for anti-inflammatory assays is essential, as cell death could confound the results. To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of β-Ch-Zn NPs, McCoy cells will be stimulated with LPS to induce an inflammatory response [ Overall, this study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the anti-inflammatory potential of biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs on McCoy cells. By elucidating their effects on cytokine production, signaling pathways, and oxidative stress, the study seeks to establish β-Ch-Zn NPs as a promising therapeutic agent for managing inflammation. The findings from this study could pave the way for further research and development of β-Ch-Zn NPs for clinical applications in inflammatory diseases, contributing to the growing field of nanomedicine [ Green synthesis of β-Ch-Zn NPs To synthesize β-Ch-Zn NPs, a zinc ion solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 mM zinc nitrate in deionized water. A 0.1 mM β-chitosan solution was prepared separately. These solutions were mixed under constant stirring to ensure thorough homogenization. To initiate the formation of ZnONPs, a freshly prepared 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution was added dropwise to the mixture while stirring vigorously. Stirring continued for 30 minutes to complete the nanoparticle formation and stabilize the β-Ch-Zn NPs. The resulting nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes to separate the nanoparticles from unreacted materials and impurities. The supernatant was discarded, and the nanoparticles were washed multiple times with deionized water to remove residual reactants, ensuring the purity and stability of the synthesized β-Ch-Zn NPs [ Characterization of β-Ch-Zn NPs The biosynthetic approach for synthesizing β-Ch-Zn NPs was confirmed through various characterization techniques. FTIR spectroscopy revealed characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups of β-chitosan and zinc oxide. The presence of broad peaks around 3,420 cm Cell culture and treatment For the study, McCoy cells (procured from the National Centre for Cell Science, India) were selected and cultured in appropriate media supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics under standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO Cell viability assay: MTT assay The MTT assay evaluated the cytotoxic effects of β-Ch-Zn NPs on McCoy cells. The results demonstrated that β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibited efficacy on McCoy cells. For analyzing biocompatibility, different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μg/mL) of conjugated nanoparticles were assessed. The cell viability was recorded. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control with the above-mentioned concentrations. From the biocompatibility testing, two concentrations were calculated based on the half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of the conjugated nanoparticles (33 and 66 μg/mL) for the gene expression analysis. The statistical significance was analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc test [ Gene expression analysis The expression levels of IL-2, IL-6, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and NF-κB were measured by qRT-PCR. McCoy cells were treated with β-Ch-Zn NPs (33 and 66 µg/mL) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Gurugram, India). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for amplification were as follows: Bax: forward 5'-TCCACCAAGAAGCTGAGCGAG-3', reverse 5'-GTCCAGCCCATGATGGTTCTG-3'; BCl-2: forward 5'-GGGAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTT-3', reverse 5'-TGAAGGAGCGCAACCGGA-3'; IL-2: forward 5'AGCAGCTGTTGATGGACCTACC-3', reverse 5'-AGTTGATGGACCTGGGAAAGG-3'; IL-6: forward 5'-CCAGGAGCCCAGCTATGAA-3', reverse 5'-CCAGGCAAGTCTCCTCATTGA-3'; TNF-α: forward 5'-GCCCAGACCCTCACACTCAG-3', reverse 5'-GCTACAGGCTTGTCACTCGG-3'. The relative expression levels of the target genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and calculated using the 2 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences between the groups were analyzed using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical significance was represented as follows: * represents p < 0.05 (statistically significant), ** represents p < 0.01 (highly statistically significant), and *** represents p < 0.001 (extremely statistically significant) [ This study synthesized β-chitosan-derived ZnONPs (β-Ch-ZnO-NPs), and their anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in McCoy cells. The analysis included the assessment of cell viability using MTT assay at different concentrations and expression of IL-2, IL-6, HIF, and NF-κB genes. UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis β-Ch-ZnO-NPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing a distinct exciton band observed at 301 nm, closely resembling the characteristic exciton absorption of ZnONPs (350-373 nm). The rapid increase in absorbance upon excitation from the nanoparticles' ground state to their excited state further confirmed their optical properties. However, a subsequent decrease in radiation absorption suggested some nanoparticle agglomeration. These results highlight the successful synthesis of β-Ch-ZnO-NPs and their promising optical characteristics for various applications (Figure  UV-Vis: ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles FTIR analysis FTIR analysis of biosynthesized β-Ch-ZnO-NPs was conducted to identify putative functional groups.

The output from XRD analysis of the as-prepared and annealed β-Ch-Zn O-NPs samples yields a plot of intensity versus angle of diffraction, as shown in Figure  XRD: X-ray diffraction; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles Effect of β-Ch-ZnO-NPs on cell viability The MTT assay evaluated the cytotoxicity of zinc nanoparticles conjugated with β-chitosan on McCoy cells. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of nanoparticles (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μg/mL) for 24 hours. Doxorubicin was used as the positive control. The viability of untreated McCoy cells served as a control (100% viability). The results showed that doxorubicin and β-CT-ZnO NPs showed similar cytotoxic patterns on the treated cells. The cytotoxicity was concentration-dependent (Figure  The statistical significance was analyzed with the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (compared every concentration of the control group to each concentration of the treatment group).

The expression levels of key proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured using q RT-PCR. The results were normalized to β-actin expression and analyzed using the 2 IL-2 expression IL-2 is pivotal in immunotherapy by stimulating T-cell proliferation and activation, enhancing immune responses against cancer cells. Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed IL-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-Ch-Zn NPs reduced the IL-2 expression by twofold (Figure  The statistical significance was analyzed with the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (comparing the control group to each treatment group).

Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed IL-6 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-CT-ZnO NPs reduced the IL-6 expression by about 45%. This suppression indicates that β-CT-ZnO NPs can modulate the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the production of IL-6, thereby reducing inflammation (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation.

This adaptive response promotes tumor survival, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy, making HIFs crucial targets for cancer treatment strategies. Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed HIF expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-Ch-Zn NPs reduced the HIF expression (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation.

LPS stimulation led to a significant increase in NF-κB expression in McCoy cells. However, β-Ch-Zn NPs treatment resulted in a substantial decrease in NF-κB expression. The reduction was most pronounced at 66 µg/mL, where NF-κB levels were lowered by approximately 50%. This suggests that β-CT-ZnO NPs can effectively inhibit the activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby attenuating the overall inflammatory response (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation. The statistical significance was analyzed using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test.

LPS-induced inflammation in McCoy cells is a well-established model for studying inflammatory responses mimicking aspects of bacterial infection and inflammation. This discussion explores the potential of β-CT-ZnO NPs in modulating this inflammatory response, drawing on recent literature to provide a comprehensive analysis.  LPS-induced inflammation in McCoy cells is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as oxidative stress and activation of NF-κB signaling pathways [  Recent literature indicated that β-chitosan in conjugated zinc nanoparticles can significantly modulate inflammatory responses. A study by β-chitosan coated ZnONPs demonstrated superior anti-inflammatory effects compared to free ZnONPs or β-chitosan alone. The authors attributed this to the enhanced cellular updates and targeted delivery of ZnONPs due to chitosan coatings [ The study demonstrates that biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effects on McCoy cells by modulating the expression of key cytokines and signaling pathways. These findings provide a strong foundation for further exploration of β-Ch-Zn NPs as potential therapeutic agents for managing inflammatory diseases. Further studies could focus on in vivo evaluations and the exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of these nanoparticles.","['cytokines', 'green synthesis', 'cytotoxicity', 'mccoy cells', 'anti-inflammatory', 'β-chitosan nanoparticles']",,Cureus,"""chlamydia"""

Providing a stronger rationale for their selection and discussing how this study advances our understanding of V. cholerae would help set the stage for your findings. • Your methodological approach is comprehensive, especially in describing the physicochemical properties of the proteins.

 Response to reviewers 1. Reviewer #1: The authors have tried to annotate a list of uncharacterized proteins from Vibrio cholerae and analysed their potency for vaccine development. I find the work is very much useful for the scientific community. Author’s response: Thank you so much for your kind comment. 2. Reviewer #2: In the manuscript “Comprehensive in-silico analyses of fifty-one uncharacterized proteins from Vibrio cholerae"", submitted by Mallick et al., the authors present an intriguing study on the characterization of 51 uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins in Vibrio cholerae. The focus on understanding these proteins' physicochemical properties, functional associations, and potential roles is well-justified and contributes to the broader understanding of cholera biology. However, a few areas could be further developed to enhance the clarity and impact of the paper.  (A) The introduction could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the significance of these particular proteins. Providing a stronger rationale for their selection and discussing how this study advances our understanding of V. cholerae would help set the stage for your findings. Author’s response: The lines 58-67 (Page 2-3) have been modified. The following lines (highlighted in yellow) are added within the manuscript: - “Understanding these biochemically, structurally and functionally uncharacterized proteins can pave the way towards mechanistic insights of how this essential GTPase, CgtA, exerts its pleotropic effect. Hence, we carried out a comprehensive in silico analysis of these uncharacterized proteins, which allowed us to predict their physicochemical and immunogenic properties and hypothesize and design various in vitro and in vivo experiments to characterize these proteins, which will lead us to understand the basis of cholera pathogenesis at a deeper level. Also, we have successfully identified a number of potential drug-targets and vaccine candidates among those 51 uncharacterized proteins that will facilitate the production of various vaccine constructs and drugs through in vivo and in vitro experiments against the Vibrio cholerae pathogen.” (B) Your methodological approach is comprehensive, especially in describing the physicochemical properties of the proteins. However, it would be useful to elaborate on why these specific properties are important for studying hypothetical proteins. Additionally, more details on the tools and databases used for solubility predictions, subcellular localization, and domain identification would enhance reproducibility and transparency. Author’s response: Lines 115-136 (Page 4-5) have been modified to include more information as per the suggestion.  “The ProtParam web server by ExPASy ( Lines 143-145 (Page 5) were added to describe PSORTb tool which is used to predict subcellular localization of a protein.  “A score is assigned for every localization site which reflects the confidence level of the prediction. A score, higher than the cut-off value 7.5 indicates a strong confidence in the predicted localization.” We have also added a minor detail about the tool PSLPred in line 147-149 (Page 5). The following line was modified as follows: - “Further, the results were confirmed by PSLpred ( Lines 157-162 (Page 5-6) was modified and added in the manuscript file. The following lines were modified and added where we have described the tools used for domain identification. “The results generated by the “Interpro” database were validated using SMART ( (C) The use of STRING for predicting protein-protein interactions is a strong aspect of the study, but the manuscript could be improved by providing more insight into these predicted interactions. Discussing how these interactions contribute to understanding the proteins' potential functions would add depth to your analysis. Author’s response: Lines 386-397 (Page 13) were added to explain the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) derived from STRING version 11.5. The following lines were added in the manuscript: - “Identification of protein-protein interaction network Protein-protein interaction or PPI network for 51 uncharacterized proteins were visualized in STRING version 11.5, which predicts the interactive protein partners using a confidence score above 0.7. The interacting partners of each of the uncharacterized proteins are tabulated in Supplementary material 3, Table S15. The highest confidence score of 0.996 and 0.994 were observed for the interaction between SpoVR family protein, Q9KQX3 and a hypothetical protein, Q9KQX4 (VC_1873) and uncharacterized protein, Q9KQX5 (VC_1872) respectively. Other interaction with high confidence score of 0.993 was seen in PPI between EAL domain containing Q9KRD2 and Q9KPJ7 (Gene name- VC_2370) which is a sensory box containing diguanylate cyclase enzyme. The findings in this study will allow us to reinforce our understanding on the probable functions of these uncharacterized proteins and decipher the molecular pathways involved with cellular functions.” (D) The experimental validation of two proteins is a valuable part of the study, but it would be beneficial to expand on the results of these experiments. Discuss how the experimental findings align with or differ from your in-silico predictions, as this correlation could be a significant strength of the paper. Author’s response: Lines 428-443 (Page 14) were added where we have compared the predicted solubility and molecular weight of the selected proteins with the experimental results. The following lines were added (as highlighted in the manuscript):-  “The GRAVY index for Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 were predicted to be -0.172 and -0.319, respectively, which indicates their solubility in solution. Also, the predictions based on SOSUI and DeepTMHMM, the two proteins were predicted to be soluble. However, while expressing the proteins in the heterologous system of E. coli BL21 (pLySs) both the proteins showed solubility issues. We have used mild concentration (2M) of polar reagent, urea, to solubilize the inclusion body. The solubilized inclusion body were then purified using a nickel-NTA column. Finally, the expression of the purified protein Q9KRD2 (Figure 6G) and Q9KU58 (Figure 6I) were checked by SDS‒PAGE, respectively. The purified Q9KRD2 showed a clear band near 100 kDa protein marker and purified Q9KU58 showed a distinct band near 15 kDa band as expected from in silico analysis. Further, the expression of the two purified protein were validared western blot analysis (Figure 6H and J). The 3-dimensional model structure of Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 is shown in (Figure 6K and 6P). Ramachandran plot validation for the protein Q9KRD2 suggested that 91.70% the residues were seen to be in the most favoured region (Figure 6L and 6M) while for Q9KU58 79.30% (Figure 6Q and 6R). Additionally, ProSA z-score of Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 found as -13.31 (Figure 6N) and -2.66 (Figure 6S) respectively ProSA was also used for assessing local model quality of Q9KRD2 (Figure 6O) and Q9KU58 (Figure 6T).”  Other aspects such as domain characterization, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions and structure are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we are currently exploring these aspects experimentally which we would like to present it in a separate manuscript. (E) In terms of structure, the manuscript could be improved with smoother transitions between sections, particularly when moving from computational analysis to experimental validation. This would help create a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, the conclusion could be expanded to emphasize the broader significance of your findings and suggest possible directions for future research. Author’s response: The “Result and discussion” part describing the structure of the 51 uncharacterized proteins, and the experimental validation of two proteins, Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 by cloning and expression has been updated as shown by the highlighted region in page-13 and 14. We have also modified the conclusion as shown by the highlighted region in page 17-18 of manuscript file. Following is the conclusion that we have added in the manuscript. “Understanding the role of uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins in bacteria are essential for bridging the gaps in our knowledge of gene functions, interactions and molecular mechanisms leading to bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed 51 uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins of V. cholerae whose expression is altered in CgtA-depleted conditions, as shown by transcriptomic and proteomic studies. We determined the physicochemical properties of the strains, such as molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point, extinction coefficient, instability index, aliphatic index, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), and total number of negatively and positively charged residues. The molecular weight of the proteins ranged from 92 kDa to 5 kDa, and the theoretical pI ranged from 4.19 to 11.40, with the majority of the proteins being acidic. The theoretical pI is defined as the point at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge at the pH scale and is useful for understanding protein charge stability. We also computed the solubilities, subcellular localizations and probable functions of the proteins and identified their domains and families using various bioinformatics tools and databases. We have observed that several of these uncharacterized proteins are involved in essential cellular processes associated with cholera pathogenesis like transcription, translation, phosphorelay signal transduction, motility and chemotaxis. These predictions are very crucial and effective for hypothesis generation and designing experiments for further validation. For functional protein association networks, STRING was used for the prediction of interactions between our uncharacterized candidate proteins and other partners. Characterizing protein–protein interactions is vital to reinforce our understanding of protein function and the biology of the cell. Additionally, we employed reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic approach to identify potential vaccine candidates and potential drug targets that will pave the way towards novel drug discovery and vaccine design against cholera pathogen. We also constructed 2D and 3D structural models with PSIPRED and Alphafold2-mmseqs2 respectively, which were further validated with ProSA and PROCHECK. The in-silico studies were further validated by experimental studies by cloning and expression of two crucial proteins (potential vaccine candidates) whose expression was altered in CgtA-depleted conditions. The protein Q9KRD2 is a 92 kDa EAL and sensory PAS domain-containing putative phosphodiesterase that is downregulated when cgtA is knocked down in the V. cholerae genome. In contrast, proteomic studies have shown that the 12 kDa protein Q9KU58 is upregulated when cgtA is knocked down in the V. cholerae genome. Our findings based on in-depth quantitative computational analysis and experimental work will help us to understand the biology of cholera pathogenesis as a whole, and also identify potential therapeutic leads at the molecular level.” (F) The manuscript would benefit from grammatical revisions for clarity, and some technical terms should be defined more clearly for readers who may not be specialists in the field. Including figures or tables to summarize key findings, such as the physicochemical properties or interaction networks, would also enhance the readability and impact of the paper. Author’s response: The entire manuscript was checked in English language editing tool, viz., Grammarly and Curie, for the purpose of enhancement of clarity for readers. Furthermore, the result and discussion part, especially the reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic part have been explained in greater details for better clarity. The figure and table captions were also re-written elaborately. (G) Overall, the study presents valuable findings that contribute to the understanding of V. cholerae proteins but addressing these suggestions could strengthen the manuscript and make it more accessible and impactful. Author’s response: Thank you so much for your valuable input and suggestions. We tried our level best to respond to your insightful queries. Thank you. 3. Reviewer #3:  (A)Explanation needed to choose CgtA over another available drug targets. Author’s response:  Although CgtA is a multifunctional essential GTPase in Vibrio cholerare, not much is known about its mechanisms of actions. Hence our laboratory has been working on it to better understand its functionality and find new or alternate drug targets based on CgtA research in V. cholerare.  (B)Explain significance of predicted 20 drug targets. Author’s response: Virulent proteins play a monumental role in pathogenesis of infectious disease and can be targeted for drug-design and therapeutic interventions. 20 potential drug targets were predicted from a pool of 51 uncharacterized proteins based on assessment generated by VirulentPred which exploits 5 prediction approaches: -  (a) Amino acid composition,  (b) Dipeptide composition,  (c) PSI-BLAST generated PSSM profiles,  (d) A cascade of SVMs and PSI-BLAST, and  (e) Higher order dipeptide composition. The threshold value for each approach was taken as 0 (zero). A positive score indicates that the protein is virulent. Whereas, a negative value indicates that the protein is a non-virulent protein.

11451835,Epidemiology and Diagnostic Accuracy of Respiratory Pathogens in Pediatric Populations: Insights From Global Studies,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the most common cause for going to the doctor’s at pediatric age. Respiratory infections are still of interest because they are widespread, significantly impact public health by potentially leading to pandemics, drive antimicrobial resistance through antibiotic misuse, more often spread globally due to traveling, and benefit from ongoing advancements in diagnostics and research for better management. This paper’s main aim was to offer a systematic review of the literature published over the last 10 years on the etiology of LRTIs. The search strategy was based on reviewing original articles, systematic reviews, position papers, and guidelines published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. The review was previously registered with PROSPERO. The final review included 27 articles that met the eligibility criteria (studies identifying the etiology of inferior respiratory infections in children, according to the WHO definition, published in the last 10 years). Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel Version 2406 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) and SPSS Statistics V.23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). The total number of patients was 2,193,978. Eight articles focused on children younger than five years, and two included children under the age of two. The results revealed that ","Although the causes of respiratory infections in children are generally known in theory, the subject is still of interest for scientists due to the imperfect ways of diagnosing and identifying the etiology, mainly because pneumonia remains the most frequent cause of death in children under five years old [ Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are defined as infections affecting the airways below the larynx or the pulmonary alveoli. They include bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. The symptoms are not specific, including fever, coughing, wheezing, difficulty or rapid breathing, and chest pain. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the physical examination on which rales or condensation are found, alongside changes in the pattern of breathing. In pneumonia, chest X-rays may help in making the difference between possible etiologies [ The aim of our paper is to identify studies on the etiology of LRTIs and perform a systematic review of the literature published over the last 10 years. Based on this information, our goal was to identify what are the possible causes of LRTIs and design a protocol of diagnosis based on clinical and biological tests that would reduce the anxiety of medical staff and parents, as well as cut down some costs of unnecessary testing, unneeded antibiotic use, and hospitalization. Our search strategy was based on reviewing original articles, systematic reviews, position papers, and guidelines published. We identified the review question, and we established the keywords for the search. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched. There was a language restriction applied: only full papers were available in English. After identifying the papers in full text, duplicates were removed, and inclusion criteria were applied. Inclusion criteria were settled: studies identifying the etiology of inferior respiratory infections in children, published in the last 10 years. We excluded all papers that did not have a full text available, including those that studied both inferior and superior respiratory infections, risk factors for infection, or associations with other pathologies such as asthma, tuberculosis, cancer, etc. For the remaining articles, we checked references for the other articles.  The population we targeted was formed out of children aged 0 to 18 years of age. LRTI was defined [ The studies were assessed regarding design, methodological quality, levels of evidence, and description. Reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). This tool was instrumental in identifying potential biases like selection or publication biases within the included studies. To mitigate these, we used comprehensive search strategies that included multiple databases and gray literature, like unpublished studies, conference abstracts, dissertations, and clinical trial registries. We applied clear and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We acknowledge the language bias. However, the included studies offer a global perspective on the subject. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklists were used for the validation of the studies included. The checklist contained ten questions that every article had to answer, regarding whether the aims were clearly stated, whether the qualitative methodology, the design of the research, the recruitment strategy, data collection, and data analysis were adequately formulated if the relationship between researcher and participants was taken into consideration, if there were ethical issues, if the findings were clearly stated, and how valuable the research is. The remaining 27 articles that met the CASP criteria and checked the PRISMA checklist were included.  This review was registered in the PROSPERO international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health in March 2022, with ID CRD42022309946. The literature screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with subsequent cross-checking to ensure accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, and if consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was involved to mediate. The following data were collected: general information on the study-publishing date, geographical region of interest, number of patients included, means of testing for etiology, and findings regarding the etiology of infection. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel Version 2406 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) and SPSS Statistics V.23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to compare the efficacy of diagnostic tools. McNemar's test was used to compare paired proportions. Cohen's kappa statistic was applied to assess the agreement between diagnostic tools. Fisher's exact test was conducted to analyze the associations between clinical manifestations and etiological agents in co-infection studies. Figure  PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Paper selection from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed databases, and English literature.

From the 27 selected papers, two are epidemiological studies [ All selected papers met the definition for LRTIs [ The demographic characteristics of the study populations across the various articles provided insights into the prevalence and impact of respiratory pathogens in children. The studies covered multiple geographical locations, age groups, and seasons, providing a comprehensive overview of respiratory infections in pediatric populations. The studies predominantly focused on children under the age of five years, with specific age subgroups such as infants (under one year), toddlers (one to three years), and preschool-aged children (three to five years). For example, the study of Lei et al. [ Seasonal trends were significant in the studies [ We compared nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) to assess pathogen detection rates in children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).  The plots in Figure  Source: References [ PPV: positive predictive value, NPV: negative predictive value, NPA: nasopharyngeal aspirates, Sp:  For Sp, NPA is reliable for ruling out infection in children ≤3 years due to high sensitivity and NPV. For Mp, NPA shows moderate to high sensitivity and specificity across all age groups, making it a relatively reliable diagnostic tool, though not without risks of false positives and negatives. Table  Source: References [ For all pathogens, the PPV is higher for NPA compared to throat swabs, meaning that a positive result from an NPA is more likely to correctly identify the presence of the pathogen than a positive result from a throat swab. For  For the under five-year-old patients, the most frequent etiology was viral. RSV was identified as the major cause of bronchiolitis, with adenovirus following alongside influenza virus. It was observed that all these infections have a seasonal presence in the community, occurring mainly in winter and spring or, according to geographical differences, in the first rainy season (March to May). Other viral agents identified were enterovirus, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These factors were mentioned only in a few studies [ In the studies concerning children above five years of age [ Source: References [ Each node represents a pathogen, with primary agents highlighted in orange and co-infection partners in light blue.

However, these are somehow implied by the definition of LRTI [ The studies [ Given the fact that respiratory infections, in general, and LRTIs, in particular, are responsible for most of the hospital admissions in children [ An important difference observed between developing and developed countries regarding the bacterial etiology of pneumonia concerns pathogens preventable by vaccination. As reported by several authors [ Regarding etiology distribution according to age, the group of patients under five years of age [ Studies from various countries provided valuable insights into pathogen prevalence, seasonal variations, and the challenges of managing respiratory infections in pediatric populations. Geographical variations can influence the results of studies on LRTI in children due to a range of factors. Firstly, different regions may have varying prevalences of specific pathogens causing LRTIs. These differences can be due to local climate conditions, population immunity, and the presence of specific pathogen strains. For instance, regions with higher humidity may see different seasonal patterns in viral infections compared to arid regions. A second factor is the availability and quality of healthcare services, including vaccination programs, access to antibiotics, and healthcare infrastructure, which differ widely between regions. In high-income countries, early diagnosis and treatment might lead to better outcomes, whereas in low- and middle-income countries, delayed treatment due to limited access to healthcare could result in higher morbidity and mortality rates. Socioeconomic status and environmental conditions, also factor in. For example, children in urban areas with high pollution levels may be more susceptible to respiratory infections compared to those in rural areas with cleaner air. Lastly, cultural practices, such as the use of traditional medicines or differing attitudes toward vaccination, can also influence LRTI outcomes. Although this review focuses on literature published in the last 10 years, the time periods during which studies on LRTIs are conducted can also have a substantial impact on their findings due to changes in pathogen epidemiology, as we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in medical technology, like the optimization of the PCR technique used now, and shifts in public health policies. However, geographical and temporal variations in LRTI study results enhance understanding of disease dynamics, enable targeted interventions and resource allocation, broaden scientific knowledge, and encourage innovation in public health strategies. Even though nowadays our main concern remains the SARS-CoV-2 infection, old viral infections start to remerge, causing less impressive, but still dangerous infections [ The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on respiratory infections was a significant focus, with studies [ We are worried about the reduction in immunization, vitamin deficiencies [ Strengths and limitations The search strategy was meant to include all the studies on the etiology of LRTIs, but we cannot be sure we did not omit some papers. Although the subject is of great interest, from a scientific and clinical point of view, generally, studies do not limit themselves to strictly targeting the etiology. Putting etiology in the context of risk factors or association with background pathology is common, but these studies did not meet the inclusion criteria for our review. Another limitation concerns the way the study was designed. A lot of the papers concentrate only on viral etiology, which is the most researched area due to the availability of testing methods and the perspective of continuous development of PCR methods. On the other hand, we included in the review studies done in different parts of the world, with different means, but the conclusions were comparable. If we collate the results on age groups, all the papers included highlight what we already knew about etiology. What is new comes from the difference in occurrence during the year, the relationship with the vaccination policy, and the means of testing; rapid tests are of great use in parts of the world where molecular biology is still out of reach or too expensive.  Clinical implications First, this review underlines the importance of localized epidemiological data in guiding effective treatment and prevention strategies for respiratory infections in children. It also underscored the complexity of diagnosing respiratory pathogens due to frequent co-infections, particularly involving HRV, HBoV, and RSV. The research highlighted the importance of vaccination as a means of reducing morbidity and resistance to antibiotics. In countries where there is a strong vaccination policy, the most common LRTIs are caused by viruses, compared to developing countries where bacterial LRTIs are prevalent, forcing doctors to increase the use of antibiotics [ Secondly, this sort of age group profile is useful for outpatients. Protocols based on this information are used to decrease unnecessary invasive therapy strategies. Even though the recent pandemic changed a lot in the way we prevent, test, and treat LRTIs, we are still confronted with the same old pathogens for which our methods of testing remain imperfect. The truth revealed again by our study is that identifying an etiology for lower respiratory infections in children is very difficult. An extended study of LRTI etiology and improving the way we obtain the specimens used for testing would be important in giving the right view of the pathology and, most importantly, on the use of antibiotics based only on clinical examination. By accurately describing age groups and their etiology, doctors would make an informed decision based on evidence, rather than on personal experience and fear.","['systematic review', 'original article', 'children', 'lower respiratory infections', 'etiology']",,Cureus,"""chlamydia"""

Yet, the role these behaviors have on HIV/STI risk has not been well elucidated, especially among transgender women (TW) and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Additionally, advances in biomedical strategies have heralded a new era of HIV/AIDS prevention that may be accompanied by behavioral changes that lead to decreases in condom usage and subsequent changes to STI sequelae.

This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices, proven preventative methods, and preferred learning methods among Peruvian TW and GBMSM. 30 interviews and 50 questionnaires were conducted with TW (N=35), GBMSM (N=35), healthcare providers (N=5), and key community informants (N=5). Most participants perceived hygiene-based practices to be common behaviors and a significant aspect of sexual wellbeing. Educational materials utilizing social media and hosting in-person events were also viewed favorably, with value to enhancing HIV/STI knowledge. Several barriers to autonomy surfaced in the data, including systemic disparities to adequate HIV/STI services, top vs. bottom social dynamics, and PrEP accessibility issues. Continued work is needed to address the barriers to the acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of hygiene-based practices, biomedical/barrier strategies, and ","Hygiene-based and other related practices in people assigned male at birth is a forgotten area of research that may prove to be important for HIV/STI prevention [ Understanding common behaviors and attitudes that impact sexual health is essential to inform the development of effective sexual health interventions [ Utilizing a mixed methods research design, this formative project was an exploratory study between November 2022 and December 2023 that primarily assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and proven biomedical/barriers strategies of Peruvian TW and GBMSM. Preferences for learning and educational messaging modalities were also explored to inform the conceptualization of a future intervention in close collaboration with proven biomedical and barrier strategies. Participants were recruited from public health centers, initially at  The eligibility criteria for TW and GBMSM included  A mix of TW (N = 10), GBMSM (N = 10), HCPs (N = 5), and KCIs (N = 5) were first asked to schedule and participate in a face-to-face, semi-structured interview in safe spaces of affiliated organizations. The themes used in the interviews were referenced from the Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) Model, the Health Belief Model, and the core components of acceptability and feasibility [ Following a preliminary analysis of the interview transcripts, TW (N = 25) and GBMSM (N = 25) were asked to complete an online, self-completed questionnaire via  First-generating descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the questionnaires and describe the characteristics of our sample. Most questions were scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Some questions were open-ended, and to further personalize one’s response, participants could choose multiple answer choices and input a typed response. Answer choices of all open-ended questions were randomized to decrease bias. All participants had the option to refuse to answer any question. Thematic analysis techniques were employed to code and analyze the interviews. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, translated from Peruvian Spanish to English, coded, and analyzed. The coding framework developed to elicit the themes within each interview was consistently refined and systematically reviewed as it applied to the data. 36% (18/50) of survey participants completed secondary or technical school, and 14% (7/50) completed university. 41% (20/49) of participants were unemployed, and 65% (28/43) made under S/1000 a month. 45% (21/47) lived alone, and 42% (21/50) shared bathroom facilities (such as a toilet, sink, or shower) at least most of the time with household or community members. 26% (13/50) felt it would be at least somewhat difficult to get the support they need from others (such as friends, family, and HCPs) to practice HIV-preventative methods.
 “I have testimonies from boys and girls here who tell me that the nurse told me that the ampoule I am going to give you is going to hurt, but that happens because you do things you shouldn’t do” Many interview participants described significant, unaddressed inequities experienced among local TW and GBMSM. These disparities ranged from inattention, inactivity, stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization in many aspects of life. There is also awareness of sociopolitical disparities faced by TW that result in insecurities in health care, education, income, and nutrition. Because of these disparities and more, a few recognized that sex work was the only means of survival for most TW. Many TW expressed themselves as feeling isolated, excluded, and completely vulnerable to the disinterest of the Peruvian government and most of its citizens. In the last 3 months, the majority (76%, 38/50) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of condoms within reach, with 82% (41/50) reporting that they will at least most likely use condoms every time during sexual intercourse. 86% (42/49) of participants were aware of PrEP, but 78% (39/50) had never taken it before. The most common reasons why participants did not use PrEP included 13 participants not having access to PrEP-related services, 12 participants not knowing about the use and benefits of PrEP, and 5 participants expressing concern about potential side effects associated with PrEP use. 3 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from healthcare personnel, and 2 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from family, friends, or colleagues. Among the participants who have taken PrEP before, 55% (6/11) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of PrEP pills. Among those who haven’t used PrEP before, 76% (26/34) are willing to take PrEP every day if proven to reduce HIV risk by at least 90%, and 74% (26/35) are willing to take PrEP every day if it is proven to have few or no side effects. If participants were to hypothetically take PrEP every day, 60% (21/35) would expect to use condoms with the same frequency as before, with 29% (10/35) expecting to use condoms at least less frequently. 53% (18/34) would expect to have about the same number of sexual partners as before, with 21% (7/34) expecting to have at least more sexual partners.
 “… there are many people who are afraid to go buy a condom at the pharmacy or the stigma that they put on us just by hearing the word “condom” because we live in a purely religious country both Catholic and Christian, evangelical and always the subject of condoms, the name condom already sounds strong. It has happened to me, I speak personally, that sometimes I tell a boy: “hey go buy a condom at the pharmacy.” And he tells me: “go buy it yourself.” So, from there I see the connotation that the same gay boys are ashamed to buy a condom in a pharmacy right?… So, I feel that there should be a campaign to remove that fear by saying condom, [because] that it’s like buying gum or going to buy a cigarette, a beer… But, I think we could do with expanding it a little more to include all these little extra things that can help, and the new forms of prevention that are also coming out: PreP, post-exposure [PEP], and all that stuff. I believe that we should give a more extensive, more comprehensive approach to everything that is prevention and not just limit ourselves to saying: “no, just use your condom, use your condom.” Many interview participants reported accessibility issues with PrEP. A few expressed concerns with the side effects associated with PrEP and ART. Some questioned why the Peruvian government hasn’t sponsored public health initiatives that destigmatize condoms and demonstrate the proper techniques of condom usage with water-based lubrication. Many considered hygiene-based practices with the use of condoms and PrEP as an important strategy to reduce the transmission and acquisition of HIV/STI. In the last 3 months, 93% (40/43) cleansed themselves at least most of the time after intercourse. 88% (43/49) were at least most likely to have regular access to a sink or shower with running water after sex. 74% (31/42) typically cleansed themselves within 15 minutes after intercourse. 69% (29/42) cleansed for at least 2 minutes. After washing, 19% (8/43) reported genital wetness. 22 participants used antibacterial soap, 11 used bar soap, and 8 used shampoo to cleanse themselves. 41 participants cleansed to become more hygienic, 19 cleansed to increase their peace of mind, 13 cleansed to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI, and 9 cleansed because it was recommended to them by either a close contact or by healthcare personnel. 69% (34/49) at least knew someone who consistently cleansed their genitals after sex. In the past 3 months, 58% (29/50) were at least most likely to use hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents to clean themselves after sex, and 26% (13/50) sometimes used an alcohol-based cleansing agent to clean themselves after sex. 34 participants used hand wipes, and 10 used alcohol-based hand sanitizer. All participants knew at least someone who consistently used hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents.
 “We always tell men that: “wash your d**k” hahahaha… Really! We tell them in reality, sometimes jokingly, right? But usually when someone approaches me, they approach me like this and I say: “have you bathed? have you washed yourself well?” If he says yes to me and then I discover when he approaches me ready for the sexual act and I perceive “oh, just there, go take a bath, go wash.” If you want and if not bye, nothing happens.” Most interviewees found genital washing to be an essential aspect of both sexual well-being and one’s general bathing process. Although many learned these practices from family members and social circles, many participants questioned this behavior’s utility, efficacy, and proper techniques. A few shared their experiences using wet wipes, especially when bathing facilities were unavailable or during time constraints. For almost all, genital cleansing was an essential aspect of one’s own or their partner’s sex life. In the past 3 months, all participants reported douching at least once before sex. 84% (38/45) had regular access to adequate amenities/supplies (such as running water, enema solution, and enema bottle) for successful douches. 71% (29/41) douched within at least 30 minutes before sex. 39 participants douched to become more clean/hygienic, 30 participants douched to make sex more pleasurable, 23 participants douched to increase their peace of mind, and 16 participants douched due to recommendations from either a close contact or from an HCP. 8 participants douched to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI. 32 participants used a water-based douching solution, 10 used a water-based solution with chamomile, and 3 used a water-based solution with salt or vinegar. 96% (46/48) have never shared enema supplies with sexual partners or other associates. 86% (42/49) knew at least one person who consistently douches before sex. In the past 3 months, 59% (27/46) participants reported douching at least most of the time after sex, with 72% (28/39) douching within at least 30 minutes after sex. 83% (34/41) douched after their most recent sexual activity.
 “This is a very worrying issue, I do this type of anal washing myself, right? More hygienic when you have your sexual relations. The issue is that it harms your health, due to the issue of the PH that we have in that part, right? And well, genital washing is normal, it should be done daily, right? Er, there isn’t as much danger there as in anal washings, which harms you. I see it daily with trans girls, uh, we talk about that, but the issue is also about cleanliness, and many people call it “pumping”, it’s the term used in the community. And they demand: “I want you to pump yourself very well”, and many people demand that kind of thing from them and many times they agree to do those washings. We know that we are harming ourselves, I for my part know it, but sometimes because of the issue of looking good, for a cleanliness issue, we agree. And in trans girls, I have seen that [anal washing] is constant, every day every so often, they even don’t eat many times because they don’t [get dirty], because they have their entire stomachs clean, and they don’t get the other person dirty. That is very worrying, and to improve this, enemas are also used, but really many people due to the issue of access to the enema, it is a bit expensive to use. Mostly they do it just like that with bottles.” Douching was a considerable part of one’s sexual hygiene or that of their partner. There was a diverse range of manifestations and justifications for douching, primarily determined by the sexual position they assumed and the accessibility of proper amenities/supplies. Some recognized their complex relationship with douching and its potential harms. A few participants shared that they significantly decreased their nutritional intake to avoid the presence of fecal remnants during planned intercourse. Some questioned why there are no resources sharing this practice’s potential harms, benefits, and proper techniques.
 “They feel bad, with shame they feel dirty, and the client is upset. And they don’t want that. Once, a man got annoyed with me, I told him to go to hell, I told him: jerk, where the hell are you going? He looked at me [and said]: “is that right?” Yeah dude, what do you think? I pump myself, but it’s not my fault that something was left out there. Don’t come to me with that “wash yourself well, stupid”. And he didn’t call me anymore, and he sent me to hell. And I tell the girls: you don’t have to let yourself be dominated like that. In other words, they are very submissive, and at times I get annoyed and tell them: stop fooling around, don’t let this jerk manipulate you and dominate you. “It’s just that he gives me money, I don’t know what to do.” Turn it around [penetrate him too]. “No, mother” [they reply]. Do it -I tell them- and you’ll see that he’s not going to bother you anymore.” In the last 3 months, 65% (32/49) of participants had access to an adequate amount of lubricant within reach at least most of the time. If participants were to have lube on hand, 82% (41/50) are at least most likely to use lube before or during intercourse. 39 participants used water-based lubricants, 16 used oil-based lubricants or Vaseline, and 9 used saliva. 72% (34/47) at least knew one person who consistently uses lubricants before or during intercourse.
 “There is no facility for that, that is a limitation… a limitation that the state must remedy, we consider it important. Because condoms are good for prevention, that is true, but they are used in areas that are not lubricated because we are talking about sexual practices with trans women, right? And they are used in areas, in the rectum, an area that is not lubricated, that is in itself a little dry, it will be wet but not enough to be able to receive, to withstand penetration without harm. Lubricant saves you.” Many interview participants acknowledged the superiority of water-based lubrication to reduce pain and rectal damage. While most stated a preference for water-based lubricants, some reported using saliva and oil-based household products for sexual lubrication due to convenience and preferences from sexual partners. Some participants noted accessibility issues with water-based lubrication and adverse symptoms associated with saliva and oil-based lubrication. In the last 3 months, 39% (19/49) of participants sometimes urinated after sex, with 53% (26/49) urinating after sex at least most of the time. 91% (43/47) typically urinated within 15 minutes after intercourse. 43 participants urinated to relieve the natural urge, 12 urinated for peace of mind, 10 urinated to decrease their risk of HIV/STI, and 9 urinated due to easy accessibility of bathroom facilities. 74% (37/50) were at least most likely to have regular access to a toilet after sex. 59% (29/49) knew of at least one person who consistently urinated after sex.
 “… they informed me from some training that it was convenient to urinate afterwards because that can help eliminate some -er, let’s say- bacteria or agents that can cause diseases of the urethral canals, right? Oh, and we recommend it. Have I been specifically asked questions about it? I don’t think so. People are not very aware of this topic, and it is rather something that I have to bring up in conversation and tell them: “uh, well, remember that after having sex, as much as possible it would be good for you to urinate, right? no?’, And in that way it helps to eliminate germs, er and to the extent possible even that could occur. Er, so, that’s what I recommend, but it’s not like -according to what I remember right now- they have come to ask me: “hey should I urinate? Or how is this urination?” I don’t know if it’s so well spread or if people know it so much that they don’t ask anymore, right? It’s probably not that widespread.” Although most interview participants performed postcoital urination, some were unsure of this practice and questioned its utility and efficacy. A few participants noted the difference in one’s tendency to urinate after sex, determined if the partner is topping (performing insertive or penetrating sex), one’s hydration status, and if they previously voided. 20% (10/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum may increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 54% (27/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum did not increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 86% (43/50) were in agreement that microscopic tears may increase the chance of contracting HIV, and 8% (4/50) did not know. 82% (41/50) were in agreement that using a lubricant before and during sex didn’t prevent oneself from contracting HIV, and 12% (6/50) did not know. 68% (34/50) were in agreement that water-based lubricant helps prevent condom breakage, and 14% (7/50) did not know. 78% (39/50) were in agreement that Vaseline, oil-based lubricant, body lotion, or cooking oils were not the correct methods of lubrication before or during sexual intercourse. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that showering or washing one’s genitals with soap and water after sex does not prevent a person from contracting HIV, and 16% (8/50) did not know. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that urinating after sex does not prevent oneself from getting HIV, and 18% (9/50) did not know. 76% (38/50) felt it would be at least somewhat easy to stay informed about HIV prevention methods.
 “ do feel that the government should have more authority in working to inform their students through the [school] curriculum, like teachers should speak about this and there should be less power of the family groups to inform because usually the family groups tend to communicate or misinform through a political agenda due to a lack of knowledge of their own, so I prefer that the person who informs them about these important things to people at this age that they need is the government or someone who has studied for 5 years for that” Most interview participants possessed an accurate understanding of basic HIV/STI science, specifically regarding transmission routes, condoms, water-based lubrication, and genital cleansing. However, some participants shared misguided information concerning douching and PrEP The majority (76%, 38/50) had access to a functioning cell phone most of the time, with 92% (45/49) having access to reliable cellular internet at least most of the time. 92% (46/50) used social media at least most of the time during the day. 60% (30/50) of participants sometimes used social media for health-related purposes, with 30% (15/50) of participants using social media for health-related purposes at least most of the time. 49 participants used WhatsApp, 48 used Facebook, 37 used Instagram, 36 used TikTok, and 34 used YouTube. 38 participants used social media for health-related purposes to increase knowledge about diseases, 38 participants to receive updates on advances in healthcare, and 27 participants to exchange tips and ideas on health topics. Participants’ preferences for learning modalities included 31 participants selecting animated videos, 31 selecting virtual educational materials on social media, 28 selecting printed educational materials, 27 selecting a website, and 21 selecting reminders from healthcare personnel.
 Most interview participants recognized the increasing convenience and usability of mobile and social media technologies. However, some acknowledged barriers to mobile technologies, including sharing devices, limitations with rural settings, and acceptability concerns with older, conservative individuals. Some participants shared optimistic perspectives regarding the integration of a hygiene-based intervention in clinical and social settings. Some also noted flyers, brochures, and in-person workshops as potential modalities to increase the awareness of a hygiene-based message. 16% (8/50) of participants were at least in agreement that it frustrates them to think that they will have to use lube before or during sex, wash with soap and water, and urinate after sex. 20% (10/50) were at least in agreement that they would be worried about using these practices because it would harm their health. 86% (43/50) were at least in disagreement with the statement that they would be worried if their healthcare provider found out if they were using a lubricant before/during sex, urinating after sex, and washing their genitals. 84% (42/50) were at least in agreement with the statement that their sexual partners and family would support them if they used these hygiene-based practices, and 76% (38/50) believed their healthcare provider would support them as well. 82% (41/50) of participants were at least in agreement that people in their community would be interested in learning more about hygiene-based practices. 74% (37/50) were at least in agreement that people in their community would consider using lube before or during sex, washing with soap and water, and urinating after sex.
 Most interviewees expressed an interest in learning more about hygiene-based practices. However, many reported barriers to their ability to be well-informed about condom-based and non-condom-based methods for HIV/STI prevention. Some identified the conservative government of Peru, traditional cultural norms, inaccurate HIV/STI resources, lack of LGBTQ+ representation, and substandard values of sensitivity from healthcare providers as the most notable obstacles faced by TW and GBMSM to optimizing one’s sexual and general health.
 “t has to be something constant and always renewable, that is not always the same, that is, not only to make the [trans] girls come for the simple fact that I give them condoms, or in a worship I give them the money, no, but make them come for other things, right? It can also be a space for articulation or union between the girls themselves who can come together and share–what do I know–an afternoon of movies, a talk or a conversation, like we call it a “tea for aunts;” a space where the community can come and -er- at any time they want, not only to receive condoms, lubricants, right? It stays as a community, but it is something that over time, as time goes by, begins to give different -um- prevention in different ways, but for the same community, right?” This study aimed to bring awareness to the commonality of hygiene-based practices and provide a preliminary assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of lubrication, genital cleansing, postcoital urination, and douching. A diverse range of viewpoints and experiences highlighted real-world trends and needs of local TW and GBMSM. Study data indicated the potential acceptability and feasibility of water-based lubrication and postcoital urination and washing, despite some participants questioning and a few sharing misguided information about the safety and efficacy of these practices. All survey and most interview participants voiced usability with douching, despite a majority of survey participants showcasing misinformation about douching’s potential harms. In addition, an impressive number of participants reported sexual uses of alcohol-based cleansers (such as hand wipes and hand sanitizer), oil-based household products and saliva-based lubrication, and douching with chamomile, salt, and vinegar. Given the prevalence of douching and other hygiene-based practices within our sample, we question whether past epidemiological research has underrepresented the commonality of receptive and hygiene-based practices among Peruvian TW and GBMSM or whether these findings are more reflective of sampling bias. Regardless, most participants recognized that local TW and GBMSM have been longing for more accessible and accurate information about douching, lubrication, postcoital urination and washing, and its associated risks, benefits, and safest techniques. A fair number of testimonials emerged during the interviews highlighting sociopolitical hardships to one’s autonomy in the context of HIV/STI risk. As this study was being conducted, most TW and GBMSM did not have the opportunity to start PrEP due to widespread accessibility issues. Even among the minority who were fortunate to have access to effective methods, a few participants were stigmatized during their adherence to PrEP and condoms, expressing that they were perceived as being “unhealthy” or “unholy” by others for simply prioritizing their sexual health. Interestingly, if given the hypothetical opportunity to take PrEP in the future, most wouldn’t anticipate any changes to their current behavioral practices. Nevertheless, some did predict an increased number of sexual partners and decreased use of condoms with hypothetical PrEP use. Furthermore, some bottoms (or partners performing receiving or receptive sex) shared accounts of victimization and manipulation for the sexual, typically risky, desires of dominant, masculine tops. Although there was a diverse spectrum of femininity and masculinity among our sample, these pains were disproportionately against submissive, feminine bottoms. Some have testimonies of being forced to douche, not using condoms or water-based lubricants, abusing poppers (an inhalant used to enhance sex and relax the anal muscles), and hiding HIV/STI pharmaceutical treatment. It’s reassuring that community leaders recognize this power imbalance and actively empower submissive TW and GBMSM; however, much more discussion and action are needed to dissipate this inequality. Regarding preferred learning modalities, multi-media deliverables are a promising area for future research and public health initiatives. Our results are in line with previous findings that show Internet-based technologies as valuable vehicles for optimizing one’s sexual health–validating the importance of low-intensity modalities. Most participants shared positive attitudes towards accurate, health-related content seen on social media. Many also recognized the utility of printed materials, in-person workshops, and other outreach events to increase awareness of a hygiene-based message. Although most participants liked the direction of the project, participants’ perspectives focused on suggestions to improve our message and implementation in the future. Recognizing the conservative nature of Peruvian society, some participants pinpointed outdated ideologies and prejudices as the main driving force for the many vulnerabilities TW and GBMSM face for equitable HIV/STI care and societal attention. Understandably, some skepticism may be present regarding the acceptability of a hygiene-based message and other new HIV/STI resources due to its novelty and the traditional nature of Peru’s culture. We are grateful that our sample shared valuable strategies to overcome these barriers and ensure a collective mission in the fight against HIV/STI. General recommendations focused on ensuring satisfactory LGBTQ + representation and advisement on all future directions of L Overall, interest in these hygiene-based practices was high, and many were curious about the project’s future. These preliminary results add to an under-valued body of literature showcasing the increasing justification of a hygiene-based message for HIV/STI prevention. To our awareness, this is the first study that explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and preferred learning modalities prioritizing TW. Given the exploratory nature of our study, we did not intend to demonstrate statistical significance from our findings. Rather, we sought to identify barriers and facilitators to inform a larger acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy study. Additional work is needed to address the identified barriers and further explore the potential of a hygiene-based message in the prevention of HIV/STI. Unfortunately, our data was vulnerable to considerable bias, and we encountered several limitations in this study. Despite our best efforts, sampling bias likely occurred, decreasing the external validity of our assumptions used to derive real-world trends. Most notably, these included advertising, self-selection, and healthy-user bias. Methodological and statistical limitations were also present, including our small sample size, lack of similar research studies to reference from, the use of self-reported data, cross-cultural and translational drawbacks, and the lack of advanced quantitative analysis techniques. In addition, the investigator team was unable to retrieve particular survey data, likely due to restricted access from a free  There were notable strengths of the study. The mentorship team actively prioritized the core values of the project’s mission and a holistic refinement process using the best available, evidence-based resources and a participatory design process among the research team. Our reliance on diverse organizations and public health centers within different districts of Peru significantly enhanced the depth and variety of perspectives from our sample. The team and our sample were fortunate to have JCA as a vital contributor to the project’s highest standards of transparency, sensitivity, and respect for all involved. All participants received evidence-based HIV/AIDS educational materials, referrals to available HIV-related services, and resources on local community organizations. All interview participants were given condoms and personal water-based lubricants, and provided a safe, private space to discuss sensitive topics of sexual health that are not common in “normal” social settings in Peru. During a post-research event, we additionally shared the study results with past participants, local TW-GBMSM organizations, and community partners. All participants were also provided a PDF copy of all published articles. Lastly, the results from this study may offer indirect benefits to researchers, educators, and key community members with an additional understanding of a variety of common behaviors and attitudes that may impact sexual health and practical approaches to sharing health-related information that may prove critical for the development of important sexual health interventions. This study represents a pivotal step in investigating the role of hygiene-based practices and multi-media deliverables in promoting evidence-based HIV/STI prevention education. Overall, participants found water-based lubrication, and postcoital urination and washing to be potentially acceptable and feasible to adhere to consistently. Most participants also shared significant usability with douching. In addition, mobile messaging modalities for health-related purposes and in-person events were favorably liked among participants.","['Hygiene', 'lubrication', 'cleansing', 'urination', 'douching', 'learning', 'intervention']",2024-9-20,Research Square,"""chlamydia"""
11451190,Analysis of binary mixture of oxytetracycline and bromohexine in their combined veterinary formulation by four simple spectrophotometric methods with greenness assessment,"Tetracyclines family is considered as the first-line antibiotic drugs for food animals. Formulating bromhexine (BR) with oxytetracycline (OTC) improved the antibacterial activity of OTC, besides it is considered as a mucolytic agent. Four precise, rapid, and simple spectrophotometric methods were successfully developed for resolution of the overlapped spectra of OTC and BR in their pure form and in their pharmaceutical formulation. The proposed methods are absorption correction (AC), dual wavelength (DW), induced dual wavelength (IDW), and spectrum subtraction (SS) spectrophotometric methods. The developed methods were used for the determination of OTC and BR in the ranges of 2–50 µg/mL and 1–30 µg/mL, respectively for all methods. For (AC) and (SS) methods, OTC and BR were determined at 380 nm and 245.6 nm, respectively after spectral resolution steps. While for (DW) method, the absorbance difference between λ (271.8 –287.6 nm) and λ (245.6 –283.2 nm) were used for the determination of OTC and BR, in order. For IDW, it depended on using the absorbance difference between 271.8 nm and 245.6 nm as well as the equality factor (F) calculated for each drug at the selected wavelengths. In all methods, HCl was used as a solvent and they are validated according to ICH guidelines. Several green metric tools have been developed to evaluate the greenness of the analytical methods like National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Modified NEMI, Analytical Eco-scale, Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Analytical GREEnness calculator (AGREE), and all ensured the low impact of the suggested approaches on health and environment. The proposed methods are highly selective, robust and precise. Additionally they are time and money effective and can be used in any analytical laboratory. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13065-024-01296-y.","Tetracyclines have proven to be effective against many pathogenic bacteria. They are used as broad-spectrum antibiotics and as prophylaxis in food animals. They are not expensive and so they are widely used in veterinary world with thousands tons of production yearly [ 
 Chemical structure of oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Bromhexine hydrochloride (BR) Fig.  According to a literature review, several analytical methods for the analysis of OTC alone or in mixture with other drugs have been reported. Among these methods are spectrophotometric [ In pharmaceutical analysis, spectrophotometry has been widely used and extensively employed due to its simplicity, low expense, easy to use and save time. The disadvantages of spectrophotometry is its low selectivity, the issue which recently can be resolved by using novel spectrophotometric methods that depend on data processing using simple algorithms. These methods such as DW, IDW, AC, and SS methods able to resolve complex spectra with minimal data processing steps and without using complex algorithms or software like chemometry. Nowadays, Green chemistry is extensively used to make chemistry healthier and ecofriendly. It works on using greener solvents, chemicals and technologies characterized by less or zero harmful environmental impact [ The goal of this research is to develop a variety of fast, accurate, selective, reproducible and low-cost spectrophotometric methods, including absorption correction (AC), dual wavelength method (DW), induced dual wavelength method (IDW), and spectrum subtraction method (SS) methods that are used to determine OTC and BR in their binary mixture as well as in their combined dosage form. The developed spectrophotometric methods have the advantages over the reported HPLC [ Oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) was kindly supplied by (Pharco pharmaceuticals, Amriya, Alexandria, Egypt), the supplied material has the purity of 99.53%, 100.34%, 99.42% and 99.53% according to the proposed methods; Absorption correction, dual wavelength, induced dual wavelength and spectrum subtraction methods, in order. Bromhexine hydrochloride (BR) was purchased from sigma Aldrich (Merck Life Science BV, Ildefonse Vandammestraat 5/7B, 1560 Hoeilaart, BELGIUM) of 98.95% 100.34%, 98.88% and 98.95% purity according to accuracy of the proposed methods: Absorption correction, dual wavelength, induced dual wavelength and spectrum subtraction methods, respectively. Oxyclear  
 Chemicals and solvents that were used throughout this work were methanol (Fisher, Southborough, UK) and hydrochloric acid, (Adwic, Cairo, Egypt) Distilled water (Sedico Pharmaceutical Co, New Cairo, Cairo, Egypt). A double beam UV- Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800 PC Series Spectrophotometer, Japan), model UV-1601 PC with 1 cm path length quartz cell, connected to compatible computer. UV-PC software version (3.7) was used for all absorbance measurements and data analysis. It was prepared by diluting 10 mL concentrated HCl by distilled water till adjusting the volume to 1000 mL. Stock standard solutions each of OTC and BR were prepared by weighing 25 mg of each drug and transferring into two separate 25 mL volumetric flasks, mixing well with about 5 mL of methanol and the volume was then completed to the mark using 0.1 mol/L HCl. Working standard solutions were prepared for each of OTC and BR by separately transferring 5 mL from their respective stock solutions (1000 µg/mL) into two separate 50 mL volumetric flasks and then completing the volume by 0.1 mol/L HCl . Six different laboratory prepared mixtures containing different ratios of OTC and BR of concentration ratios of (25/1.5, 20/20, 40/2, 50/3, 50/5, 30/10 µg/mL, in order), were prepared by adding different volumes from their respective working standard solutions into a set of six 10 mL volumetric flasks and then the volume was adjusted with 0.1 mol/L HCl. Details of the prepared mixtures are presented in Table  Pharmaceutical dosage form stock solution of (2500/150 µg/mL) was prepared by .delivering 1.25 mL of Oxyclear Several dilutions were obtained from the previously prepared working solutions (100 µg/mL) to obtain samples containing OTC and BR separately in the ranges of 2–50 µg/mL and 1–30 µg/mL, respectively using 0.1 mol/L HCl for final dilutions. The spectra of each drug were recorded over the wavelength range of 200–400. Further processing of the stored spectra was done following the instructions of each method for construction of the calibration curves. Calibration curve was constructed relating OTC absorbance λ Calibration curve was conducted relating the difference in absorption between λ  The absorbance of OTC at 245.6 nm was recorded and then multiplied by the equality factor of BR (F Calibration curve was constructed relating absorbance at λmax = 380 nm) to OTC corresponding concentrations. Calibration curve was plotted relating absorbance at 245.6 nm to the corresponding BR concentrations. Calibration curve was constructed relating the difference in absorbance difference between 245.6 nm and 283.2 nm (zero difference for OTC) to different BR concentrations. The absorbance of BR at 271.8 was recorded and then multiplied by the equality factor of OTC (F After that, regression equations were computed for the studied components. The spectra of the previously prepared mixtures were recorded over the range of 200–400 nm and further data processing was performed to calculate the concentrations of the studied drugs in the prepared mixtures. The absorbance of the stored spectra of the mixtures was determined at λ While for BR determination in the mixture, the absorbance of the mixture at 380 nm was multiplied by absorptivity factor of OTC (λ The absorbance difference between 271.8 nm and 287.6 nm in the stored spectra of the mixtures (zero difference for BR) was used for the determination of OTC. After that, the concentration of OTC was computed using the corresponding regression equation. For BR determination in mixture, the absorbance difference between 245.6 nm and 283.2 nm in (zero difference for OTC) was calculated. After that, the concentrations of BR were then calculated using the corresponding regression equation. For OTC determination, the absorbance of each mixture at 245.6 was multiplied by the equality factor of BR (F For the BR determination, the absorbance of mixture at 271.8 nm was multiplied by the equality factor of OTC (F For OTC determination in mixture, the mixture spectrum was divided by the normalized spectrum of OTC resulting in plateau region. The amplitude value at the plateau region at 380 nm was then multiplied by OTC normalized spectrum resulting in D The spectra of the prepared pharmaceutical dosage form sample was recorded from 200 to 400 nm and then the developed methods applied for resolving the laboratory prepared mixtures were followed and the regression equations previously computed were used to calculate the concentrations of the cited drugs. Standard addition technique was performed on three different concentrations of each drug to evaluate method accuracy. It was quite challenging to separate the overlapped spectra of multi-component mixtures without prior separation of the active constituents. Spectrophotometric methods are favored over other expensive and complex instrumental methods like chromatographic methods which are often necessitate the optimization of various conditions such as pH, temperature, and flow rate. In this work, four simple methods are adopted to resolve the overlapped spectra of OTC and BR. The proposed methods are absorption correction, dual wavelength, induced dual wavelength and spectrum subtraction methods which have the capability to distinguish between these spectra in few, easy and precise steps so they can be used for quality control and routine analysis of the studied mixture. Different solvents were tried such as methanol, water, 0.1 mol/L HCl and 0.1 mol/L NaOH during methods optimization. 0.1 mol/L HCl was found to be the best solvent for final dilution regarding spectral resolution and method selectivity. Additionally all prepared solutions and samples were found to be stable for at least 1 week in 0.1 M HCL where no spectral changes were observed upon scanning over the range of 200–400 nm. This method is useful to solve the overlapped spectra of two drugs in condition that, one of them shows no interference from the other one at certain wavelength. It cannot be used for resolving of complete overlapped spectra [ - This method uses the absorbance at two selected wavelengths, one at λ

Dual wavelength method provides an effective method for the analysis of a drug in the existence of another interfering drug using their zero order spectra without derivatization [ Dual wavelength method depends on pre-selection of two wavelengths [(λ For OTC determination, the absorbance difference between λ While for BR, the difference between λ Unlike dual wavelength method, this technique can be used when the absorbance difference between the two selected wavelengths for the interfering substance is not zero which gives IDW an advantage over DW method [ IDW method relies on the prior selection of two wavelengths; (λ Firstly, two wavelengths are chosen; λ For analysis of Y: 
 Equality factor of pure X is calculated (Fx) which is equal to the ratio of its absorption at λ Calibration curve for pure (Y) is plotted relating the difference in absorption between λ For measuring (Y) in the binary mixture, the absorbance of the mixture at λ Component (x) can be determined by the same way using the equality factor of (Y) [F The selected wavelengths for determination of OTC and BR were 271.8 (λ For OTC determination in the mixture, equality factor of BR (F Where F While for BR determination in mixture, equality factor of OTC (F Where F The values obtained from (1) and (2) were used along with the regression equations to calculate the corresponding concentrations of both OTC and BR in the prepared mixtures.

After that, the mixture of (X and Y) is divided by the normalized spectrum of (X) to get a plateau region. absorbance at λ For drug (Y): a-it can be determined by subtracting the resolved spectrum of (X) from the total spectrum of the mixture, and then the absorbance of the resulted spectrum of (Y) is recorded at λ For OTC determination, the spectrum of the mixture was divided by the normalized spectrum of OTC to obtain a plateau region. The absorbance at 380 nm in the plateau was then recorded and multiplied by the normalized spectrum of OTC to extract

 Statistical comparison of the results obtained by applying the proposed spectrophotometric methods and the reported method for determination of oxytetracycline and bromhexine Student’s t-test (2.131) F-test (3.438) Five metric systems namely National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI) [ 
 Green profile for the developed spectrophotometric methods and the reported TLC and HPLC methods National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), it is a metric system used as a qualitative evaluator which deals only with chemicals and reagents. It consists of four sectioned pictogram divided as the following; PBT (persistent, bio accumulative and toxic), Hazardous, Corrosive and waste. Spectrophotometric methods showed three green sections, this is due to the usage of hydrochloric acid which is not listed in EPA’s TRI list and RCRA list so it is not considered as a PBT or hazardous solvent keeping the upper two sections green .On the other hand, pH of 0.1 mol/L HCl which is reported to be corrosive. Additionally, the waste for one sample was 10 mL so the waste generated was found to be less than 50gm keeping the waste section colored green. For the reported HPLC method [ Regarding to the modified NEMI tool, it was found to take an advantage over the NEMI system by taking into consideration the energy of the instruments. It is a five sectioned pictogram represents health hazards (NFPA scores for health hazards), safety hazards (NFPA scores for flammability hazards), environmental hazards, energy, and waste amount. Each section consists of three sections colored; green, yellow or red which indicates the greenness of each section. Spectrophotometric methods had four green fields (Environmental hazards, safety hazards, energy and waste amount) with one yellow field (Health hazards). On the other hand, the reported HPLC methods [ For GAPI metric system, it is a semi quantitative tool that deals with different parameters including sample preparation, reagents used and instrumentation. Spectrophotometric methods resulted in seven green, five yellow and three red sections (due to moderately high solvent consumption for preparation, waste generated and health hazards of HCl), For the HPLC reported method [ For Eco-scale system, it is also a semi quantitative tool that took into consideration the hazard effects of each solvent singly. For spectrophotometric methods, the use of low number of solvents solvents (hydrochloric acid only) and lower energy consumption gave lower subtracted penalty points (10 PP) than the reported ones which scored 23 PP [ Concerning to AGREE metric, it is a quantitative tool depends on converting the 12 principles of green analytical chemistry into a score ranged from 0 to 1. For the developed spectrophotometric methods, the overall score for AGREE system was 0.78 while for HPLC method [ It is obvious that every metric method helped to reveal a green side by providing certain information about specific issue concerning the developed and the reported methods giving a complete vision on the comparative study between them. Hence, it is advisable to use more than one metric system to evaluate any method of analysis. The used tools confirmed the superiority of the developed methods over the reported one. Details are given in Table  Successfully the developed spectrophotometric methods proved the ability for determination of OTC and BR in their binary mixture in the pure form and in the pharmaceutical dosage form without any previously separation steps. The suggested methods are fast, accurate, precise, selective, and reproducible. Also the developed methods were able to resolve the overlapped drugs with few steps in zero order spectra without any further dervitization steps. Validation of the developed methods was applied according to the ICH guidelines giving acceptable results. Furthermore, the application of green chemistry principles has evaluated the environmental impact of the developed methods using five different metrics: NEMI, Modified NEMI, Analytical Eco-scale, GAPI, and AGREE which demonstrated that they are not only efficient but also environmentally responsible. The developed methods proved that they can be used effectively for the routine analysis of the investigated drugs in QC laboratories. Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

11469891,Risk of Postoperative Complications After Total Hip and Total Knee Arthroplasty in Behcet Syndrome Patients,"Behcet syndrome (BS), a multisystem autoimmune disorder, has unclear effects on outcomes after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study assessed the relative risk of perioperative adverse events in patients with BS. This retrospective cohort study used the PearlDiver M157Ortho data set, a large national administrative database. Total hip arthroplasty and TKA patients with BS were identified and matched 1:4 to those without BS based on patient age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores, and procedure performed (THA or TKA). The incidence of 90-day adverse events was determined and compared by multivariate analysis. 5-year survival to revision surgeries was assessed and compared with the log-rank test. After matching, 282 THA/TKA patients with BS were identified and compared with 1127 without BS. On multivariate analysis, patients with BS were at independently greater risk of aggregated any (odds ratio [OR] 2.16,  Patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA experienced markedly greater 90-day postoperative adverse events. The findings underscore the need for optimized perioperative management for patients with BS undergoing arthroplasty.","Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are frequently performed orthopaedic procedures to alleviate pain and restore function in patients with end-stage osteoarthritis and other joint disorders. Behcet syndrome (BS) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that is associated with immune dysregulation, cardiopulmonary issues, and vascular dysfunction. Multiple studies have explored the risk factors of adverse events after orthopaedic surgeries, with factors such as age, comorbidity burden, and specific conditions like diabetes mellitus being associated with increased risks. Behcet syndrome, although less common than RA, presents a similar challenge in the orthopaedic setting, given the disease's multisystem involvement and the potential side effects of treatments. Thus, using the PearlDiver M157Ortho data set, this study aimed to evaluate the relative risk of 90-day adverse events and 5-year survival to revision surgery in patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA compared with those without BS. This work builds on the growing trend of leveraging large national databases to evaluate nuanced patient populations, providing insights that may not be attainable through localized studies. This study used the 2010-2022 PearlDiver M157Ortho data set (Colorado Springs, Colorado). This is a large Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act report national billing claims data set containing information on over 157 million orthopaedic patients in the United States across all payer types and sites of care. All PearlDiver data are output deidentified and aggregated at the user interface level; thus, our institutional review board deemed studies using this database exempt from review. Current Procedural Terminology codes 27447 and 27130 were used to identify patients who underwent primary TKA or primary THA, respectively. Patients who had any diagnosis related to trauma, neoplasm, or infection on the day of surgery were excluded from the study cohort. International Classifications of Disease codes were used to isolate TKA and THA patients with and without Behcet syndrome (BS). Several patient demographics were abstracted, including age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI, a longitudinal measure of patient comorbidity burden generated using International Classifications of Disease codes). TKA/THA patients with and without BS were subsequently matched in a 1:4 ratio based on age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed (TKA or THA) using the PearlDiver system. 90-day postoperative adverse events were identified based on International Classifications of Disease codes, as previously described. 5-year revision surgery rates were then defined based on the occurrence of revision codes after index TKA/THA procedures. Survival to revision surgery was determined for matched cohorts of TKA/THA patients with Behcet and without Behcet and compared between the 2 groups. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare demographics of arthroplasty patients with and without BS both before and after matching. The Welch  A multivariate logistic regression model controlling for patient age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed (TKA or THA) was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of experiencing adverse events in the 90 days after arthroplasty surgery in the matched cohort of patients with BS compared with those without BS. 5-year survival to revision surgery was compared between matched cohorts of arthroplasty patients with and without BS using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Log-rank analysis was conducted to evaluate for a statistically significant difference in 5-year survival between the 2 cohorts. All statistical analyses were conducted using the in-built PearlDiver system. Statistical significance was designated as  A total of 2,119,069 arthroplasty patients were identified in the data set from 2010 to 2021, of which 1,437,208 (67.8%) underwent TKA and 681,579 (32.2%) underwent THA. Of this group, 282 patients (0.013%) had a diagnosis of BS, among which 171 (60.6%) underwent TKA and 111 (39.4%) underwent THA (Table  Univariate Analysis of Unmatched and Matched Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Patients With and Without Behcet Syndrome THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty, ECI = Elixhauser Comorbidity Index Bold entries represent statistically significant  After matching arthroplasty patients with and without BS 1:4 based on age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed, 1127 patients (80.0%) without BS were identified and compared with 282 (20.0%) with BS.

THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty Post hoc power analysis revealed the average power for the study to be 0.556, suggesting moderate overall ability of this study to detect differences in adverse events between TKA/THA patients with and without BS. At present, there is a scarcity of clinical research examining surgical outcomes in patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA. Existing studies include a single case report demonstrating a patient with BS who experienced massive pulmonary embolism after THA In our extensive study involving a large cohort of over 2 million patients undergoing THA and TKA, we observed that a small fraction had BS, representing just 0.013% of the study population. This incidence rate is in line with previously reported incidence rates of BS in the United States, ranging from 0.005% to 0.011%. Once the populations were matched and variables controlled for, there were differences in perioperative outcomes for those with versus without BS. Of the adverse outcomes analyzed, BS patients had greatest increased odds of experiencing postoperative pneumonia. This aligned with known irreversible parenchymal lung damage associated with patients with BS that predisposes them to pneumonia. The increased odds for UTI for those with BS may align with genital ulcers that are a well-documented complication of BS. Pulmonary embolism was the other individual perioperative adverse outcome associated with BS. There already exists a body of literature highlighting the pulmonary vascular disease as a clinical feature of BS. This study revealed no difference in the rate of revision surgery within a 5-year period after THA or TKA, indicating that while patients with BS carry a markedly higher risk of short-term complications, their risk on long-term issues are similar to those without the condition. Notably, the complications seen in this population seem to be largely medical rather than surgical. This is encouraging that after mitigation of short-term complications, longer term implant survival may not be affected. This study has several limitations. Notably, administrative data are limited based on the accuracy of coding. Additional administrative data do not provide patient-reported, surgeon-reported, or radiographic outcome measures; thus, these clinically relevant measures are unavailable in this study. In addition, medical therapies administered during the perioperative period including immunosuppression or anticoagulation were not controlled for in the analysis. Finally, surgical approach, hip-specific outcome measures, and adverse surgical outcomes were not assessed. In conclusion, patients with BS undergoing TKA/THA have increased risk of postoperative complications including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and UTI. Increased care must be taken during the perioperative period to mitigate these risks. Specifically, given the greater risk of pulmonary embolism, patients with BS undergoing TKA/THA may be considered for stronger venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Furthermore, given the greater risk of infection in patients with BS, notably sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI, likely due to immunosuppressive medications used to treat the disease, holding these medications in the perioperative period could be considered. In addition, close postoperative monitoring is required in this group to detect early signs of infection. Ultimately, while there is an increased risk of postoperative complications, the longer term similar revision rates should be encouraging to those with this condition and those caring for them.",[],2024-10-10,JAAOS Global Research & Reviews,"""std"""

Noted for high efficiency, ","Perovskite is a substance with a crystalline composition according to the formula ABX A general perovskite solar cell (PSC) consists of an ETL (Electron Transport Layer) and an HTL (Hole Transport Layer). These layers efficiently obstruct the migration of electrons or holes from the absorber to the front or back contact, while facilitating the transport of the generated electrons and holes to the metal contacts.

Fungal strains were cultivated overnight and subsequently harvested, followed by a single wash with PBS. Whole-protein extraction was next performed in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, achieved by grinding cells using glass beads and a turbulence-mixing system adapted onto a vortex machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

11469041,Nanofiber Topographies Enhance Platelet‐Fibrinogen Scaffold Interactions,"The initial contact with blood and its components, including plasma proteins and platelets, directs the body's response to foreign materials. Natural scaffolds of extracellular matrix or fibrin contain fibrils with nanoscale dimensions, but how platelets specifically respond to the topography and architecture of fibrous materials is still incompletely understood. Here, planar and nanofiber scaffolds are fabricated from native fibrinogen to characterize the morphology of adherent platelets and activation markers for phosphatidylserine exposure and  Fibrinogen is a natural component of blood clots and a candidate material for wound dressings. Here, fibrinogen coatings of different topography are demonstrated to activate platelets to different degrees. It is uncovered that the increased surface area of 3D fibrinogen nanofibers favors platelet noncoagulant responses, while plasma components render the scaffolds less adhesive. Topography thus steers blood‐material interactions and platelet responses.
","The treatment of acute and chronic wounds has evolved into one of the greatest challenges of our rapidly aging population. When a blood vessel gets injured, platelets (i.e., thrombocytes) adhere to the subendothelial matrix and form a thrombus through fibrinogen‐mediated platelet‐platelet aggregation. So far, the role of surface topography on platelet‐material interactions has been investigated predominantly in the context of dental implants. Microtextured titanium disks with rough surfaces led to enhanced platelet adhesion from platelet rich plasma (PRP) Fibrin gels can be readily fabricated from (autologous) plasma or from purified fibrinogen by the addition of thrombin and calcium. While fibrin gels offer a simple route to 3D nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, We first characterized the surface topography of nanofibrous versus planar fibrinogen scaffolds. As a reference to facilitate comparisons with previous platelet studies, we included coverslips that were coated with fibrinogen by physisorption from solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and confocal microscopy images showed flat, almost featureless surfaces for the physisorbed glass and planar scaffolds, with an increased fibrinogen staining density on planar scaffolds ( Interactions of human platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) with fibrinogen scaffolds of different topographies.

SEM images showed mainly round platelets without or with filopodia on physisorbed and planar fibrinogen surfaces, whereas platelets appeared denser and more spread on fibrinogen nanofibers (Figure  The failure of platelets from PRP to spread on flat fibrinogen surfaces was unexpected considering that fibrinogen is the primary ligand of the most abundant integrin on platelets,  Interactions of washed human platelets with fibrinogen scaffolds of different topographies.

Bars and error bars show mean and s.e.m. of replicates, respectively. For (e,f), differences between topographies were assessed by a ratio paired  We next investigated how different aspects of the nanofiber topography contributed to platelet responses. We first assessed whether the micrometer‐scale substrate curvature affected platelet adhesion and spreading. Platelets on nanofibers were found to spread in both, convex regions (“peaks”) or in concave regions (“valleys”) of the undulated 3D landscape ( Influence of scaffold curvature and locally accessible surface area on platelet interactions. a) Representative confocal slices of single platelets on nanofiber scaffolds.

Data analysis was based on high‐resolution deconvolved confocal  Apart from forming a mountainous landscape on the micrometer scale, fibrinogen nanofibers offer a substantially increased surface area due to their thin diameter and porous network architecture (cf. Figure  Based on this analysis, we hypothesized that an increased locally accessible surface area due to the mountainous 3D topography directly modulated platelet spreading by offering more immobilized fibrinogen molecules that can be bound by platelet integrins. To test our hypothesis in a more generic setting, we turned toward PDMS micropost arrays as a geometrically well‐defined 3D topography model. We compared two cases: arrays in which only the tops of posts were microcontact‐printed with fibrinogen while the surfaces between posts were passivated, restricting platelet adhesion and spreading to the printed post tops, versus arrays that were uniformly coated with fibrinogen by physisorption, allowing platelets to adhere on posts or in the gaps between posts (Figure  It is well established that the activation threshold of platelets in solution depends on plasma components, Modulation of platelet adhesion on fibrinogen scaffolds by plasma components. a–f) Representative confocal images of a) PRP on untreated scaffolds or b–f) washed platelets on scaffolds preincubated with b) platelet‐poor plasma (PPP), c) bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg mL To test whether the reduction in platelet adhesion was due to a blocking effect, we preincubated the scaffolds with albumin, a major component of plasma commonly used to reduce unspecific protein adsorption or cell adhesion to artificial surfaces. Washed platelets spread normally on albumin‐blocked planar and nanofibrous scaffolds (Figure  The thrombogenicity of materials often is an indirect effect mediated by activation of coagulation, Many blood‐biomaterial interactions take place under shear flow which is known to affect platelet‐surface interactions through adhesion receptor mechanotransduction. Interactions of whole blood with planar or nanofiber fibrinogen scaffolds under flow. Scaffolds were integrated into a flow channel and whole blood was flown over the scaffolds using a defined flow rate. Platelets were visualized by the fluorescent DiOC6 membrane stain in epifluorescence at two frames per second. a) End frame (left, inverted colormap) and kymographs (right) of time‐lapse acquisitions at shear rates of 1500 s The two major findings of our study are that a 3D nanofiber topography facilitates platelet interactions with fibrinogen scaffolds by increasing the local surface area (Figures  Different platelet activation outcomes, most importantly proadhesive integrin activation (enabling attachment at wound sites and platelet aggregation), procoagulant PS exposure (contributing to thrombin‐driven coagulation), as well as prohemostatic and proangiogenic  Immobilized fibrinogen is a well‐known activating stimulus that induces platelet spreading. The interaction of plasma components with the fibrinogen scaffolds that happened before platelet adhesion, rather than their direct action on platelets, led to reduced platelet‐scaffold interactions (Figure  Altogether, our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of employing self‐assembled biomimetic nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds to enhance platelet adhesion and spreading as compared to planar fibrinogen surfaces. Further studies are required to elucidate the interactions of plasma proteins with these scaffolds and their capacity to modulate platelet‐scaffold interactions. It is expected that these differential blood‐scaffold interactions based on topography also change the interactions of other cells with the material. This opens up the opportunity to employ fibrinogen scaffolds with defined topography‐function relationships for various tissue engineering applications, e.g., as novel wound dressing materials or implant coatings. Toward future applications in wound healing where platelets are known to recruit and instruct immune cells, it will be critical to assess the interactions of immune cells with nanostructured fibrinogen scaffolds, ideally taking PRP exposure into account. Targeted modulation of platelet responses by topography may have potential to enhance responses in patients who suffer from impaired wound healing. Other avenues for fibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are the cocultivation of skin cells to develop new biomaterials for skin tissue engineering or the tailoring of the topography of fibrinogen‐based biomaterials for stem cell differentiation or blood vessel replacement. Our more general finding that surface topography on the nanometer to micrometer scale differentially affected certain platelet activation pathways suggests that topography could be exploited as a design parameter for new biomaterials to prevent excessive clotting while supporting the physiological function of platelets. In this respect, we speculate that (nano)topography might be usable as an alternative to heparin coatings of implants. Generally, the comprehensive methodology used in this study could be applied to delineate the particular contributions of plasma proteins and platelets to define blood‐material interactions also for other (bio)materials. Improved understanding of how the interactions of plasma and/or PRP with tissue engineered scaffolds, either by design Glass slides coated with (3‐aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) were used as substrate to prepare nanofibrous and planar fibrinogen scaffolds following a previously published routine. As previously introduced, Micropost arrays containing micropillars of 2.65 µm in height and 1 µm in diameter arranged in hexagonal arrays between solid supports were prepared as previously described.

11468921,Primitive asteroids as a major source of terrestrial volatiles,"The origins of Earth’s volatiles are debated. Recent studies showed that meteorites display unique mass-independent isotopic signatures of the volatile element Zn, suggesting that Earth’s Zn originated from materials derived from different regions of the Solar System. However, these studies largely omitted meteorites from the differentiated planetesimals thought to represent the Earth’s building blocks, which underwent melting and substantial volatile loss. Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn. The remaining Zn was supplied by primitive materials that did not experience melting and associated volatile loss. Combined with other findings, our results imply that an unmelted primitive material is likely required to establish the volatile budgets of the terrestrial planets. Primitive unmelted material supplied nearly 90% of Earth’s zinc and likely other volatiles.","Despite an expanding search in the Solar System and other parts of our galaxy, life remains undetected outside of our planet. With the advancement of observational technology and a seemingly infinite pool of potentially habitable exoplanets, determining the events that led to the habitable conditions on Earth becomes increasingly more important. Yet, both the nature of Earth’s accreting materials and the manner in which they coalesced are still debated. A common approach to address the origin of the materials from which our planet formed is to use nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies to fingerprint the Earth’s building blocks among diverse Solar System materials. These small but detectable differences (mass-independent “anomalies”) in isotope compositions result from the heterogeneous distribution of isotopically distinct grains through the cloud of gas and dust from which all Solar System bodies formed. An important advantage of this approach is that these anomalies are not altered by secondary stable isotope fractionation induced by physical or chemical processes. This makes them a reliable signature, which can be used to establish genetic links between different materials. Most meteorite groups in our inventory have been extensively characterized for isotope anomalies of many elements, revealing a clear dichotomy in the distribution of material in the Solar System. Carbonaceous meteorites, which are thought to originate from beyond the orbit of Jupiter, are generally enriched in the neutron-rich isotopes of Fe-peak elements such as Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Zn ( The diversity among Solar System materials has been exploited in multiple studies that attempted to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition by modeling mixtures between different meteorite groups. Some of these studies have shown that it is possible to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition for various elements by mixing only chondritic meteorites, which are derived from primitive, undifferentiated planetesimals ( A scenario where Earth accreted primarily from chondrites is, however, not without caveats. The mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of chondrites are markedly different from the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) ( Nonetheless, because of analytical challenges that prevented the identification of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of volatile elements for decades, constraints on the origin of Earth’s volatile inventory are much more limited. These elements, which condense at relatively low temperatures of <1100 K ( For many years, volatile-rich objects from the CC reservoir have thus been suggested to have supplied volatiles to the terrestrial planets ( The present study focuses primarily on characterizing the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites derived from differentiated planetesimals, including both the silicate and metal fractions, as sampled by achondrites and iron meteorites, respectively, but additional CCs and NCCs are also included (see Materials and Methods). The results are reported using the  The plotted results reflect compiled data from this study and from Martins  In line with other isotope systems and previous Zn results ( The Zn isotope anomalies are likely produced in the same sites as the anomalies of other Fe-peak elements. Thus, the results obtained here are compared to modeled nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies produced by type Ia supernovae (SNIa) ( Group means encompass results from this study and from Martins  Furthermore, the Zn results correlate with measured isotope anomalies of the other Fe-peak elements ( The results are in agreement with predictions for anomalies of ( Notably, the magnitude of the Ca and Ti isotope anomalies appear to increase with the volume of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), while the Zn isotope anomalies stay roughly the same ( While the mass fraction of the carbonaceous material accreted by Earth has been estimated previously using nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of refractory elements, these estimates do not constrain the CC contribution to Earth’s Zn budget. This is because, unlike for refractory elements, the Zn concentrations of different Solar System materials vary substantially. In general, CCs are rich in Zn, with concentrations ranging from ~100 to almost 400 μg g Despite potentially contributing just 10% or less to Earth’s mass ( The simulation was performed for 10,000 trials, but only results that yielded Earth-like compositions (ε The probability density functions (PDF) of the Zn mass fractions derived from CC and NC reservoirs, encompassing 1201 solutions, yield a mean ε Notably, the lower end of the range determined for the CC Zn fraction (~30 to 50%) is compatible with estimates obtained in other recent Zn isotope studies. Steller  These results contrast with an estimate for K, which suggests a contribution of just 20% from CCs ( The search for Earth’s accreting materials has led to multiple studies that used nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as tracers to identify potential building blocks, often arriving at different mixing proportions of CC versus NC materials. An early work by Lodders ( Other studies included achondrites in their estimates, which can lead to very different results. Warren ( There are, however, additional factors that favor the incorporation of achondrites, and hence differentiated planetesimals, in Earth’s building blocks. The mass-dependent Si isotope compositions of achondrites have been shown to be heavier (enriched in higher-mass isotopes) than chondrites, a feature that is also seen in the BSE ( Taking these factors into account, the models discussed in the following attempt to reproduce not only the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition but also the concentrations of key major elements. The models are based on Monte Carlo simulations in which arbitrarily selected meteorite groups were mixed in randomly generated proportions (Materials and Methods). The isotope data included in the models are Δ Because of the lack of data for some isotope systems (ε The results of the models are shown in  The numbers on the panels correspond to the Run number of the simulation ( Groups included in the models: CI, CM, CO, CV, EH, EL, H, L, LL, eucrite parent body (EPB), angrite parent body (APB), and unsampled materials 1 and 2 (UM1 and UM2: eucrite- and angrite-like elemental abundances and mass-dependent isotope compositions but OC- and EC-like nucleosynthetic isotope compositions for UM1 and UM2, respectively). Checkmarks indicate BE characteristics that are successfully reproduced in each run. In Run 2, 10 Last, Run 3 performed 10 The models suggest that Earth likely accreted an unsampled, volatile-depleted material with an NCC-like nucleosynthetic isotope composition. Therefore, another simulation (Run 4) was performed, which included two hypothetical unsampled materials, representing differentiated planetesimals. Because ECs and OCs accounted for ~90% of the mass in Run 1, which successfully reproduced nucleosynthetic isotope compositions, in Run 4, the unsampled materials are assumed to average out to OC- and EC-like nucleosynthetic isotope compositions, with mean OC and EC values attributed to unsampled materials 1 and 2 (UM1 and UM2), respectively (table S3). Furthermore, achondrites contribute most to Earth’s mass in Run 2 (62 ± 17%), such that their elemental abundances appear to be most compatible with the BE. In addition, the mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of achondrites are also heavier than those of chondrites and largely overlap with BSE values (table S3). Hence, the elemental abundances and mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of both UM1 and UM2 were allowed to vary within estimates for the EPB and the APB. For Run 4, both the nucleosynthetic isotope and the major element compositions were used as criteria for selection of valid results, in addition to the final BE Zn concentration, which is estimated to be between 40 and 70 μg g The need for some unsampled materials in Earth’s accretion was previously raised because the nucleosynthetic Mo isotope composition of the BSE requires the addition of a material that is more enriched in s-process nuclides than any known meteorites ( However, the effect of this distinct s-process enriched material is much more prominent for the BSE’s Mo isotope composition than for Zr isotopes. In detail, while ~50% of the Mo in the BSE appears to have been supplied by the s-process enriched material ( The different enrichment levels of s-process nuclides inferred from Mo versus Zr and Sr isotopes likely reflect the different metal-silicate partitioning of these elements. In detail, early accreted Mo was largely segregated into the core during differentiation due to the siderophile nature of the element, whereas lithophile Zr and Sr preferentially stayed in the BSE. The BSE’s Mo isotope composition thus reflects the last ~10 to 20% of Earth’s accreting materials, while Zr and Sr record the compositions of most of the Earth’s accreting materials ( Given that the timing of accretion of the different materials is not constrained by the present models, late addition of both CC and unsampled s-process enriched NC materials can be accommodated, in line with the BSE’s Mo isotope composition ( Last, the ε Alternatively, if the mass-independent Si isotope compositions reported by Onyett  Notably, the ε The models presented in this study constrain not only the origin (inner or outer Solar System) but also the extent of volatile depletion of Earth’s precursor materials. In detail, the average Zn concentrations of the materials that provided valid results in Run 4 were calculated, yielding 52 μg g In detail, Hin  Yet, this extensive loss of volatiles during accretion is halted once a differentiated body has enough mass to prevent gaseous molecules from escaping its atmosphere. By comparing the velocities of molecules for an ideal gas under magma ocean conditions with the respective escape velocities, one can estimate the radii required for a planetesimal to retain its volatiles during degassing ( The limited Zn contributions from differentiated planetesimals is in line both with geochemical evidence from achondrites ( Differentiation was ubiquitous among the first bodies to form in the Solar System due to the high abundance of  While materials from the inner Solar System supplied a substantial fraction of the Earth’s Zn budget, the addition of primitive materials that formed at much greater heliocentric distances (CCs) is still required to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition. This finding also extends to K, the only other volatile element for which nucleosynthetic anomalies have been identified to date ( Limited mixing between the CC and NC reservoirs has been linked to the scattering of planetesimals and planetary embryos induced by orbital instabilities of the gas giants in the early Solar System ( The study encompassed (i) eight achondrites, including three ureilites, one howardite, two eucrites, one acapulcoite, and one aubrite; (ii) two IAB complex iron meteorites; (iii) three CCs; (iv) six ECs; (v) one OC; and (vi) one R chondrite. Together, 21 meteorites were analyzed, with all relevant information, including meteorite sources, summarized in table S1. Multiple aliquots of the US Geological Survey (USGS) geological reference material BCR-2 were analyzed for quality control. These samples were either used up completely by destructive analysis during the course of the study (Orgueil, Murchison, NWA 13299, MIL 07028, MAC 88136, Tennasilm, Djoua, Nantan, and Toluca) or remaining sample aliquots (Winchcombe, Indarch, PCA 91238, LAR 06025, NWA 11880, NWA 11754, NWA 11757, NWA 11890, NWA 11395, NWA 12265, NWA 8287, and BCR-2) are stored at the Department of Earth Science & Engineering, Imperial College London. Digestion and preparation of the samples and the subsequent Zn isotopic measurements were carried out in the Mass Spectrometry and Isotope Geochemistry (MAGIC) Laboratories at the Department of Earth Science & Engineering of Imperial College London following the procedures outlined by Martins  The original silicate meteorites, weighing between 0.36 and 18.2 g, were crushed in an agate mortar and pestle. Smaller fractions, ranging from 0.158 to 2.74 g, were subsequently aliquoted for this study, depending on the expected Zn content.

As such, the models presented here focus on lithophile elements, which trace most of Earth’s accretion. Neodymium was not included, however, because the BSE’s Nd isotope composition was possibly altered by collisional erosion and preferential loss of more incompatible elements ( Notably, estimates for the bulk Zn and Zr concentrations of the APB and EPB are not available, as is the nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition of the APB. The Zn concentrations of the APB and EPB were thus allowed to vary within the observed ranges of the respective meteorites, which correspond to 0.11 to 8.9 μg g Because angrites are rare (only 20 specimens) and have very low Zn contents, it was not possible to characterize the nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition of this meteorite group for this study.

11468847,Printed Silk Microelectrode Arrays for Electrophysiological Recording and Controlled Drug Delivery,"The use of soft and flexible bioelectronic interfaces can enhance the quality for recording cells’ electrical activity by ensuring a continuous and intimate contact with the smooth, curving surfaces found in the physiological environment. This work develops soft microelectrode arrays (MEAs) made of silk fibroin (SF) films for recording interfaces that can also serve as a drug delivery system. Inkjet printing is used as a tool to deposit the substrate, conductive electrode, and insulator, as well as a drug‐delivery nanocomposite film. This approach is highly versatile, as shown in the fabrication of carbon microelectrodes, sandwiched between a silk substrate and a silk insulator. The technique permits the development of thin‐film devices that can be employed for in vitro extracellular recordings of HL‐1 cell action potentials. The tuning of SF by applying an electrical stimulus to produce a permeable layer that can be used in on‐demand drug delivery systems is also demonstrated. The multifunctional MEA developed here can pave the way for in vitro drug screening by applying time‐resolved and localized chemical stimuli.

","Electrical tissue interfaces have a substantial influence in the field of bioelectronics and lie at the nexus of electrical engineering, biology, and material science. Flexible electrode arrays based on polymeric substrates have been developed as bioelectronic surface interfaces. The silk MEA developed in this study used a carbon electrode and carbon hydrogel electrode, as schematically presented in  Schematic representation of a) the printed soft silk MEA and b) steps for fabricating the MEA by inkjet printing. c) Photograph of printed MEA using silk as an insulator and substrate (scale bar = 0.5 cm) wrapped onto a glass cylinder. d) Image of the silk MEA on gelatin brain model which illustrates the high degree of conformal contact that can be achieved; to allow the devices to be manually handled, the chips in both (a) and (b) were supported by 50 µm PEN foil. The use of inkjet printing allowed us to adjust the carbon nanoparticle content in the final film, meaning that the printed device's conductivity can be tuned, whereby a higher carbon nanoparticle content resulted in a printed device with higher conductivity. The following silk‐fibroin‐based materials are the main focus of this work:

After additional processing, the silk can remain in the physiological environment for up to 1 month remaining its insulating properties. Carbon–silk electrode: A high‐carbon SF solution used as a conductive hydrogel–silk electrode.

A calibration curve was constructed with UV–vis absorption. First, a layer of methylene blue was printed on top of carbon macroelectrode. Next, a silk carbon nanocomposite film was inkjet‐printed to cover the methylene blue layer. The nanocomposite was immersed in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to voltage pulse of 0.5 V for 5 s. UV absorbance spectroscopy was then used to analyze the solution, showing how much methylene blue had been released. The drug release from conventional silk films that were not doped with carbon was also assessed for comparison (Figure  To identify the maximum amount delivered by the silk carbon nanocomposite film, we used different voltages to assess the cumulative release. No methylene blue could be detected under 0.15 V, and a plateau was reached after 0.3 V, indicating that the film could not release any more of the methylene blue after that level (Figure  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used on control structures to examine the carbon–silk nanocomposite film's electrical properties, specifically to show how coatings affect the electrode's impedance across a broad frequency range.  Electrochemical properties of the silk carbon nanocomposite film. Electrochemical impedance spectra recorded in PBS using macroscopic films of bare carbon electrodes, electrodes modified with a silk carbon nanocomposite, and electrodes after voltage trigger. In order to demonstrate film functionality, a proof‐of‐concept experiment was designed to explore whether the voltage pulse triggered release of fluorescein nanoparticles. First, we directly printed a single drop of fluorescein nanoparticles (diameter of 100 nm) onto a carbon microelectrode. This was then covered by a drop of the carbon–silk nanocomposite film. Afterward, we used fluorescence microscopy to image the release of the fluorescein following electrical stimulation, which enabled the quantification of the amount of fluorescein released.

Figure  For future work, rather than using glass to support the ultrathin MEA for in vitro applications, we envision that a biodegradable material such as gelatin or silk could serve as a temporary stiffener for in vivo applications. This work describes a novel silk‐based MEA that is both soft and ultraflexible. The MEA is a sandwich construction of a silk–carbon nanocomposite in between a substrate and an insulator, both also made of silk. We have demonstrated how layers with various properties, including conductive, insulating or electro‐responsive characteristics, can be achieved by varying the composition of the silk ink. When used as an insulator in a physiological environment the silk barrier showed good stability over 30 days. Using models with methylene blue and fluorescein nanoparticles, we examined the drug release behavior of this nanocomposite in the form of macro and microelectrodes, demonstrating that by tuning its properties it can serve as a drug‐delivery platform that can be controlled electrically. Such a precise technique for on‐demand drug delivery would pave the way for effective therapies with reduced toxic effects as the drug delivery could be adjusted to meet the temporal and spatial requirements of specific conditions. Moreover, in vitro assays may also benefit from such a controlled delivery, for example, when performing high‐volume drug screening or as part of cell biology investigations. Because the properties of the silk nanocomposite can be adjusted, facilitating both stability and dosing control, the platform described here may contribute to the development of new drug delivery techniques based on customized drug‐release profiles. Last, the silk MEAs were shown to be applicable for the in vitro extracellular recording of the action potential of HL‐1 cells. Future work should consider using a biodegradable silk layer as a temporary stiffener for the implementation of devices for in vivo applications. The process of preparing the carbon ink was done as in prior work. A Dimatix Materials Printer (Dimatix DMP‐2850, Fujifilm Dimatix Inc., USA) was used to produce the MEAs. The inks were first prepared for printing by sonicating them for 5 min, and then they were passed through a 0.2 µm PVDF syringe filter. The following parameters were employed in the printing process: 2.4 pL Samba cartridges (Fujifilm Dimatix Inc., USA), a 1 kHz jetting frequency, a 22 µm drop spacing, a substrate holder and printhead temperature of 21 °C, a 16 µs jetting period, and a 40 V jetting voltage. For the planar substrates, the printhead‐substrate distance was 250 µm. To ensure the easy handling of the ultra‐flexible MEA, SF was jetted onto glass substrates or 50 µm PEN foil. The noradrenaline ink (NA ink) consisted of 60 wt % NA solution (10 m Aqueous SFn solution was prepared using the established purification protocol. For all release experiments of electro‐responsive printed silk carbon nanocomposites, modified electrodes were immersed in PBS and submitted to release stimulation. The PBS solutions containing the released methylene blue were analyzed with UV–vis spectroscopy (Analytik Jena Specord 200 [Jenoptik, Germany]) at a wavelength of 662 nm to quantify the amount of methylene blue released. To determine the cumulative release of the methylene blue in response to voltage stimulation, the release solution was removed for analysis at given voltage pulses was collected and measured using UV–vis spectroscopy. All the measurements were carried out in ambient atmosphere using a commercial s‐SNOM in reflection mode (neaSNOM, attocube Systems AG). A PtIr‐coated AFM tip (Arrow‐NCPt, NanoAndMore GmbH) was illuminated using a coherent, broadband pulsed beam from a difference frequency generation laser source (TOPTICA Photonics AG). The output beam was set to the 1200–2200 cm All chips were incubated with deionized water for 5 min for cleaning before the electrochemical measurements were performed. A reservoir was produced by adhering the MEAs to glass rings 10 mm high and with a 7 mm diameter using PDMS. A Biological potentiostat (VSP‐300 potentiostat from BioLogic Science Instruments) was utilized to conduct the electrochemical experiments. The medium for all experiments was PBS as a supporting electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl electrode (Super Dri‐Ref SDR 2; World Precision Instruments, USA) was used to reference the recorded signals. The sheet resistances were measured using a four‐point probe head from Jandel connected to a Keysight B2900A source measuring unit. The MEAs were incubated in 70% ethanol for 10 min for sterilization, after which they were rinsed using sterile distilled water. Next, a coating comprising 2.5 µg cm For the statistical assessment of the results presented (HL‐1 cellular recording using silk MEA), MATLAB's findpeaks* function was employed to detect the individual spikes having a minimum peak prominence of six times the standard deviation of the trace. To calculate the background noise, the regions with spikes were ignored and the standard deviation was calculated on the remaining data. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

11468547,Tissue‐Engineered Cochlear Fibrosis Model Links Complex Impedance to Fibrosis Formation for Cochlear Implant Patients,"Cochlear implants are a life‐changing technology for those with severe sensorineural hearing loss, partially restoring hearing through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, they are known to elicit an immune response resulting in fibrotic tissue formation in the cochlea that is linked to residual hearing loss and suboptimal outcomes. Intracochlear fibrosis is difficult to track without postmortem histology, and no specific electrical marker for fibrosis exists. In this study, a tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis is developed following implant placement to examine the electrical characteristics associated with fibrotic tissue formation around electrodes. The model is characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and an increase in the resistance and a decrease in capacitance of the tissue using a representative circuit are found. This result informs a new marker of fibrosis progression over time that is extractable from voltage waveform responses, which can be directly measured in cochlear implant patients. This marker is tested in a small sample size of recently implanted cochlear implant patients, showing a significant increase over two postoperative timepoints. Using this system, complex impedance is demonstrated as a marker of fibrosis progression that is directly measurable from cochlear implants to enable real‐time tracking of fibrosis formation in patients, creating opportunities for earlier treatment intervention to improve cochlear implant efficacy. This study focuses on the development of a tissue‐engineered system for mimicking fibrotic response occurring after cochlear implant placement, enabling real‐time monitoring of implant electrical response. A representative circuit model, informed by electrical impedance spectroscopy, is constructed for this tissue‐engineered system, and a new electrical fibrosis marker is found that corroborates with observations during cochlear implant healing in patients.
","Hearing loss affects 20% of the world's population with an ≈5% needing clinical intervention. Implants are known to elicit an inflammatory response, associated with fibrotic encapsulation. Despite the relevance of intracochlear fibrosis to residual hearing loss, we possess few methods for tracking fibrosis in CI patients. In this study, we investigate complex impedance as a biomarker for fibrosis progression by developing a 3D tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis. We replicate the intracochlear fibrotic environment by encapsulating clinical‐grade CI electrode arrays inside tissue‐engineered fibroblast‐seeded fibrin gel constructs. We show significant and consistent changes in complex impedance over time, with which we produce a realistic electrical circuit model for fibrosis development. We also utilize full voltage waveform measurements to propose an electrical marker of fibrosis development that could be implemented clinically, finding similar electrical behavior in our measurements of patient samples. The results presented in this study and the markers we propose will enable us to track cochlear fibrosis progression in real‐time, allowing for earlier treatment intervention for combating residual hearing loss for CI patients. We modeled cochlear fibrosis by producing a fibrous sheath around a clinical‐grade cochlear electrode array. To generate this model, we injected molded fibrin gels containing fibroblasts into a 3D‐printed mold, with the cochlear electrode array centered on the axis. These electrode arrays with cell‐seeded gel constructs were suspended in culture media inside a conical bioreactor, to set the electrode array and ground electrode location for consistent electrical measurement ( Schematic of 3D bioreactor setup. A) Schematic of the tissue‐engineered cochlear fibrosis model construct including a cochlear implant electrode array encapsulated with a fibrin gel with 3D‐seeded fibroblasts. e1 represents the first/most apical electrode. B) Image of the three apical electrode contacts including connecting wires. We observed considerable axial contraction of the constructs ( Contraction and histology analysis of the constructs. A) Representative image set showing contraction of the construct over the course of the experiment. The length of the construct was calculated using the known mid‐to‐mid contact spacing of the electrode arrays to calculate the scale of the images for each electrode array and timepoint separately, which was then used to calculate the length of the construct. B) Relative contraction of the constructs, normalized to day 0 absolute length, over time. Single datapoints are shown in grey lines with open circles. Mean ± standard deviation is shown for the stimulated and unstimulated groups (ns = not significant, univariate n‐way ANCOVA) in bold as well as all constructs. Relative contraction is significant over time ( Next, we performed histology to retrieve information on cellular orientation and extracellular matrix morphology (Figure  Use of electrical stimulation as a method to prevent CI fibrosis has sparked recent interest. Given that constructs axially contract, we found in some cases, constructs would contract away from electrodes that were covered on day 0. To understand the 3D structure of the constructs relative to positioning along the arrays, samples ( Confocal fluorescence imaging of the construct. 3D orientation of the construct, as fixed on day 14, related to the electrode array.

B) Total and close‐up of a stimulated construct. Both constructs show attachment of the cells on the electrode surfaces. Actin fibers in the cells can be seen spreading out over the surface of the electrodes and numerous cells are attached to a singular electrode alone. Within the statistical tests described in this section, an effect of experiment number was found on relative contraction and DNA quantification (Figures  We hypothesized that complex impedance would change as measured via EIS with cellular contraction and construct remodeling. To test this hypothesis, we tracked complex impedance spectra over six timepoints to day 14. These spectra were fitted to a circuit model ( Complex impedance measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS was measured on all electrodes, regardless of having an open circuit (e.g., air bubble or broken electrode). The exclusion criteria, as described in the materials & methods section, led to  Fitted circuit elements over time with construct on showed CPE phase (CPE‐P) and magnitude (CPE‐T) stay constant, while circuit element R A commonly studied circuit to model contact impedances in relation to cochlear fibrosis was introduced by Tykocinski et al. and includes a resistor in parallel with a capacitor representing EE interface and a single resistor in series representing the bulk of tissue (Figure  To translate the changes in complex impedance to an electrical measurable in patients, we measured voltage waveforms at all timepoints for electrodes with and without construct on ( Measured voltage waveforms, contact “impedances” and SPPR over time.

We used the CI company's software function to measure mutliple timepoints along voltage waveform response, to measure an altered version of SPPR (6 µs into each phase) as well as compare this to the contact impedances ( Contact “impedances” and altered SPPR of four recently implanted CI patients.

Individual data are shown in grey, the mean of each patient is shown in bold. A significant increase in contact “impedances” is seen from intra‐op to post‐op on group level ( Contact impedances showed a significant increase from intraoperative to postoperative timepoints (F = 139.1,  SPPR was only available for two postoperative timepoints (Figure  Mean comfortable loudness levels (MCLs), expressed in the log‐scale unit of current levels (CLs), were available for the 3 and 5 months postoperative timepoints for a subset of electrodes. MCLs are complex and likely to vary due to patient‐related factors such as, but not limited to, auditory nerve survival and central factors. Therefore, we looked at the relationship between change in SPPR and contact impedances with change in MCLs, as to correct for between‐patient differences in absolute MCL. When looking at changes in contact impedances and SPPR (Figure  In this study, we tissue engineered a 3D model of cochlear fibrosis that behaves similarly to data we collected from a postoperative population of patients with cochlear implants. This model was designed to improve our understanding of the fibrotic response that occurs during cochlear implantation and ideally will be used in conjunction with large‐scale human data collection and animal models to improve outcomes for patients experiencing the effects of fibrosis from the placement of a cochlear implant. We used a tissue‐engineered, cell‐seeded gel to simulate the electrical environment of a fibrosing cochlear implant on a clinical cochlear electrode array. We analyzed these data both biologically and electrically to confirm the usefulness of this system as a model for cochlear fibrosis. Finding that we could recreate some of the conditions that we observed in a patient population, we developed a new marker based on our electrical data that was also found to increase in our postoperative patient‐derived data at group level. Cochlear implants are known to cause fibrosis formation in the cochlea that can lead to residual hearing loss for cochlear implant patients. Our tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis has the advantage of including the electrode array that is used in the clinical setting for CI patients, as well as incorporating the 3D aspect of fibrous tissue encapsulation that is known to behave differently from 2D tissue. To design a new electrical marker of fibrosis progression, we first needed to understand the complex impedance changes over time in our model. We proposed a new electrical circuit to represent the changes in our model of cochlear fibrosis and showed significant changes in complex impedance over time. The elements representing the bulk of the construct (R EIS revealed changes in both impedance magnitude and phase angle over time and when modeled with our proposed circuit, revealed significant changes for those circuit elements representing the bulk of the construct. The changes in R To allow for easily measurable data in CI patients using current clinical software and to provide a comparison with currently collected data from patients, we measured voltage waveform responses at each electrode. The clinically measurable contact impedances showed an increase over time, which is in line with studies examining contact impedances and fibrosis formation. We fitted our circuit model of fibrosis encapsulation to voltage waveforms measured and found significant correlations with the output of complex impedance fitting, showing an opportunity for additional information extraction from voltage waveforms in CI patients, which is possible with research software. The model presented in this paper could be used as a drug‐testing platform, where changes in complex impedance, SPPR, and contraction could be used to test ways to inhibit or even reverse fibrosis. Patient biopsies could be used to build patient‐specific models of cochlear fibrosis. In our study, we did not observe any effects on our cells from applied electrical stimulation, despite contrary observations in some studies. As our system is meant to represent the immune response to CI implantation, we have notably not included immune cells within this model. Fibrosis in vivo is complex and involves other cell types beyond just fibroblasts. One limitation of this model is that clinical fibrous encapsulation is attached to the walls of the cochlea, making longitudinal contraction to the levels seen in our study less likely. In conclusion, this study presents a tissue‐engineered model of fibrosis progression on a clinical cochlear implant array. It demonstrates complex impedance as a marker of fibrosis progression and applies the changes found in complex impedance to directly measurable cochlear implant patient data. A new marker, the SPPR, provides a potential mechanism for gauging cochlear implant fibrosis formation progress in patients, with no additional software or equipment needed. These findings can be used to track fibrosis formation in patients in real‐time, allowing for earlier treatment intervention, and can be used in drug‐testing platforms to test and develop new treatments inhibiting fibrosis and therefore combating residual hearing loss. The findings in this study hold the potential for generalization to other neural implants with fibrosis formation, opening up new areas of exploration and treatment, for improving implant science. The overall goal of this study was to find an electrical biomarker for the development of fibrosis in a 3D bioreactor model with visual feedback in real‐time. The 3D bioreactor models (Figure  During six timepoints over a course of 14 days, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and full voltage waveform responses were measured for the stimulated group. Additionally, contraction status of the construct was captured with a hand‐held digital microscope at seven timepoints (including day 0). The experiments were repeated three times, with five bioreactors in the first round ( The experiments were ended on day 14 to prevent the construct from contracting off the electrode fully, at which point not enough tissue would be available for a follow‐up assay. Outliers that were present in the electrical dataset were excluded based on their complex impedance response (see EIS section for details). For a detailed description of the experimental methods described in the results, see the Detailed Methods section in the Supporting Information. MED‐EL (Innsbruck, Austria) cochlear implant electrode arrays were manufactured for the purpose of this study. The electrode arrays are identical to the arrays of clinical implants within the MED‐EL FLEX series, consisting of 12 platinum‐iridium contacts in a silicone array (Figure  Prior to placing the electrode array and ground within culture media in the conical, a fibrin gel was cast around the electrode array. A 3D‐printed platform was designed to keep the electrode array in place, while the construct was cast within a 3% w/v Pluronic‐coated (Pluronic F‐127, Sigma–Aldrich) silicone tube. The protocol for fibrin gel fabrication follows the Roberts et al. approach. To track localization of the construct relative to the individual electrodes, photos were taken at seven timepoints (on the day of fabrication and every measurement timepoint thereafter) using digital microscope (Dino‐Lite, Premier AM4113T). Whether the construct was on or off individual electrodes was decided by visual inspection and subsequent analysis (EIS and voltage waveform analysis) was grouped on this basis. Contraction analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Image scaling was calibrated to the known mid‐to‐mid electrode contact spacing for each image. The mean and standard deviation of the calculated scaling was then used to calculate the length of the construct. Error bars in Figure  DNA was quantified for a subset of constructs following the Kim et al. protocol for papain digestion of the constructs and Hoechst 33258 fluorescence assays. Samples for histology were prepped on day 14 by fixing the construct in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Thermo Scientific) for 2 h. Thereafter, the construct was removed from the electrode array and cut in transversal and longitudinal slices (Figure  Samples (2 constructs, from Exp3, one stimulated, one unstimulated) for confocal imaging were fixed on day 14 in 4% PFA for 15 min. While keeping the construct on the electrode array, the construct was permeabilized for 10 min with 1% Triton‐X (Fisher Scientific) in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS, Oxoid Ltd.). The constructs were first incubated with phalloidin‐iFluor 594 reagent (Abcam) for 1.5 h at a concentration of 4 µL mL The electrode array and ground electrode were connected to an impedance analyzer (RS PRO LCR‐6100) via printed circuit boards and a data acquisition system (DAQ, USB‐6212, National Instruments), powered by a power supply (Keithley 2614B SourceMeter). An AC signal with an amplitude of 100 mV was used to collect complex impedances from 10 Hz to 100 kHz, with 10 frequencies per decade at equivalent logarithmic intervals. The order of stimulation of the electrodes on the array was randomized using LabVIEW (v2018, National Instruments Corp.) to a total of three repeats per electrode per timepoint. The mean and standard deviation per three repeats were calculated for the absolute impedance magnitude and the corresponding phase angle in MATLAB. To exclude outliers (e.g., broken electrodes or an air bubble present on the electrode), timepoints for individual electrodes on the arrays were excluded when the 25% highest standard deviations of the phase angle ( EIS data was then modeled using ZView (v3.1, Scribner Associates Inc.) to fit an equivalent circuit (Figure  The data were then fitted using ZView's complex calc‐modulus data weighting fitting, with a maximum of 100 iterations and 100 optimization iterations. Circuit element  Additionally, an example response was fitted with the simple circuit described for voltage waveform responses of cochlear implants (Figure  In order to measure full voltage waveforms, as measured during clinical contact impedances, the electrode array was connected to a CI emulator (Advanced Bionics, AB, CA, USA). With this emulator, current stimuli can be generated by the Bionic Ear Data Collection System software (BEDCS, AB) when connected to a headpiece, an external sound processor (AB Clarion Platinum), a Clinician's Programming Interface (CPI‐2, AB‐6500, Clarion) and a laptop. The electrode array was stimulated with monopolar biphasic charge‐balanced pulses with a phase duration of 50 µsec and an amplitude of 50 µA, both cathodic‐leading and anodic‐leading. Recordings were made with an oscilloscope (Teledyne LeCroy HDO4054A‐MS, LeCroy Corp., New York, USA). The order of stimulation, and thus recording, were randomized using LabVIEW to a total of 15 repeats per pulse and electrode. When EIS recordings exhibited unusual high absolute impedances across all frequencies, the electrode was excluded from voltage waveform data collection for that timepoint. The collected voltage waveforms were filtered using a first order digital Butterworth low‐pass filter with a cut‐off frequency of 80 kHz, using MATLAB's function  Clinically measurable contact impedances were calculated by taking the peak of the first phase of the cathodic‐leading biphasic pulse and dividing it by the input current (50 µA). Additionally, the SPPR was calculated (Figure  To correlate the second phase voltage peak ratio with EIS‐fitted circuit elements, a linear function was fitted to the SPPR over time using MATLAB's  After modeling the EIS circuits to the data, voltage waveforms were simulated with the outputs of the model in a similar fashion to Jiang et al. Since Ohm's law states the voltage is the product of current and impedance, the voltage can be expressed as:
 To obtain the voltage waveform response in the time‐domain, an inverse Laplace transform was performed on the formula for voltage in the frequency‐domain:
 This can be solved so that the voltage ( To find the circuit elements, the normalized, filtered, mean voltage waveform of 15 repeats was used as an input. All voltage waveforms were fitted for which a comparative EIS fitting was available on day 2. First, the step function  Data were collected from four patients implanted with a Cochlear Ltd. (Sydney, Australia) using Custom Sound EP 6.0, which allows for data collection of voltage per unit input current at several timepoints within the waveform. Three patients (P1, P3, P4) received a later‐wall electrode (C622) while one patient (P2) received a modiolus‐hugging electrode (CI612). One timepoint was collected intraoperatively, while four timepoints were collected 3 months and 5 months postoperatively (Figure  All data are shown in the figures as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated.

11468513,Agent-Object Relationships in Level-2 Visual Perspective Taking: An Eye-Tracking Study,"Visual perspective taking (VPT) generates a shared frame of reference for understanding how the world appears to others. Whilst greater cognitive and neurophysiological demands are associated with increasing angular distance between the self and other is well documented, accompanying attentional characteristics are not currently understood. Furthermore, although age and group status have been shown to impact task performance, other important cues, such as the relationship between agents and objects, have not been manipulated. Therefore, 35 university students participated in an eye-tracking experiment where they completed a VPT task with agents positioned at a low or high angular disparity (45° or 135° respectively). The congruence between the age of the agent (child vs adult) and the object they are attending to (e.g., teddy-bear vs kettle) was also manipulated. Participants were required to respond to the direction of the object from the agent’s position. The findings reveal more fixations and increased dwell-times on agents compared to objects, but this was moderated by the age of the task agent. Results also showed more attentional transitions between agents and objects at higher angular disparities. These results converge with behavioural and neurophysiological descriptions of task performance in previous studies. Furthermore, the congruency of the relationship between agents and objects also impacted attention shifting and response times, highlighting the importance of understanding how social cues and contexts can modulate VPT processes in everyday contexts and social interaction.","Representing the visual perspectives of others is a fundamental sociocognitive process. Evidence supports a distinction between the ‘level 1’ computations which are fast, involuntary, and required for visibility judgments (L1-VPT;  To-date, no eye-tracking experiments have been conducted with L2-VPT, yet eye-tracking data from L1-VPT and related processes such as gaze-cueing reveal significant effects of task manipulations. For example, work on gaze-cueing reveals preferential attention to in-group others (for a review see  Understanding the influence of social cues on perspective representation is also gaining increasing attention. To date, VPT has been shown to be affected by social factors such as group status ( A close thematic relationship between agent and object (e.g., ‘doctor’ and ‘stethoscope’) results from the cooccurrence of one or multiple semantic features which are processed by a general representational mechanism ( Crucially for VPT tasks, where an agent typically looks at an object in front of them, Becchio et al’s ( In summary, this pre-registered study ( Replicating previous behavioural findings ( Extending previous ingroup effects on VPT ( We hypothesise that congruent age-object relationships will result in significantly quicker response times (akin to  To supplement the pre-registered hypotheses, and for clarity, there is currently no evidence for any outcome measure to hypothesise an interaction between angular disparity and object congruence, angular disparity and avatar-age, object-congruence and avatar-age, or a three-way interaction. 35 participants (27 female) from XXXXX participated for course credit or were recruited via advertisements placed around campus and paid £5.00. 1 participant was removed due to low overall accuracy (<66%). The final sample included 34 participants (26 female;  A 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures design with three independent variables of angle (low vs high), avatar-age (child vs adult) and object-relevance (relevant vs irrelevant) as factors. Example stimuli can be seen in  Example stimuli to demonstrate manipulations of avatar-age, object congruence and angular disparity. Participants completed an adapted version of the Kessler and Thomson ( Participants rested their heads on a fixed chin rest 60 cm from the 19 inch (360 × 270 mm) ViewSonic Graphic Series G90fB coloured display screen. The left eye of participants was recorded using an EyeLink 1000+ eye-tracker running at 1000 Hz. Participants were shown example images of the objects facing left and right (see Figure X for some examples). Participants were then shown example experimental stimuli (see Figure X) and told that they had to respond to whether the object was facing right or left from the avatars position using the ‘Q’ for leftward and ‘P’ for rightward. Each trial began with a fixation cross lasting 750 ms and was followed by the experimental stimuli that remained on screen until a response was made or 8 seconds had elapsed. The experimental stimuli were 1024 × 460 pixels and appeared centrally on the screen; this corresponds to 33.4 × 15.35° of visual angle which should mean participants had to move their gaze to focus on the individuals sat at the seating positions (a graphic with the standard 5° of visual angle (149.03 × 149.03 pixels) laid over an example stimulus can be seen in  The red square represents 5° of visual angle from the centre of the screen. The target objects and avatar positions are located beyond the boundaries to encourage eye-movements. On each trial, a total of two  Factors of angle (45°/135°), avatar-age (child/adult) and age-object relevance (relevant/irrelevant) were entered into a linear mixed effects model for response times, number of fixations, area-of-interest transitions (AOITs) and proportionate dwell times, and logistic regression for accuracy data using the lme4 package ( Means and standard deviations on all dependent measures for all conditions. Results from Mixed Effects Logistic Regression on Accuracy Data and Linear Mixed Effects Analysis on Response Times. Results from Linear Mixed Effects Analysis on Number of Fixations, Area of Interest Transitions and Dwell Time Proportions. Before proceeding to hypothesis testing, it was important to confirm that there was no effect of object.

First, to supplement behavioural and neurophysiological distinctions between low and high angular judgements with attention data. Second, to further examine the effects of avatar characteristic in L2-VPT using eye-tracking to measure the number of fixations, the number of transitions between agents and target objects, and the proportion of time spent fixating on the agents and objects. Third, to explore whether stronger thematic relationships between agent and object impact L2-VPT similarly to how they affect gaze judgements ( A corpus of work supports the distinction between processing level-2 visual perspectives at low and high angular disparity ( Evidence is increasing that agent attributes such as humanness, group-status and age affect the computation of visual perspectives ( Whilst acknowledging that salient characteristics modulate attention in previous research (e.g.,  As hypothesised, agent-object incongruence increased the number of AOI transitions, extending the known influence of thematic relationships on language comprehension ( Object relevance was also found to interact with avatar-age. Whilst object relevance did not affect response times for adult avatars, for child avatars, age-relevant objects reduced response times and age-irrelevant objects increased response times. This suggests that while less interference is experienced from incongruent cues when paired with an in-group member, additional social cues facilitate or disrupt perspective representation of outgroup others. Importantly, real-world experience is important for developing thematic relationships ( The interaction between avatar-age and object relevance visible in eye-tracking data was modulated by angular disparity. At low angles, where perspective taking can rely on an egocentric frame of reference ( On all trials, objects and agents were located in predictable positions. Real-world social cues are often dynamic with regular gaze shifts, varying distances and changing agent-object relationships. To better resemble real-world social processing, future eye-tracking research could vary room layouts or present stimuli as to encourage naturalistic viewing behaviour ( Our angular disparity findings raise an interesting question regarding attention allocation required for different types of L2-VPT. Previous work distinguishes between visual and spatial forms of L2-VPT and finds that judging whether a ‘6’ or ‘9’ appears on the left or right is more effortful than whether the agent ‘sees’ a ‘6’ or ‘9’ ( Evidence that agent-object relationships significantly impact cognitive effort and attention allocation in L2-VPT demonstrate the role of perspective representation in understanding intentionality and predicting behaviour. Our results are the first to demonstrate the effects angular disparity on attention allocation in L2-VPT, extending the current cognitive and neurophysiological evidence ( Raw data available at: ","['visual perspective taking', 'level-2', 'agent object relationships', 'object congruency', 'intentionality', 'eye-tracking', 'stereotype']",,Journal of Cognition,"""std"""
11468397,Secretome from estrogen-responding human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells rescues ovarian function and circadian rhythm in mice with cyclophosphamide-induced primary ovarian insufficiency,"Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is an early decline in ovarian function that leads to ovarian failure. Conventional treatments for POI are inadequate, and treatments based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as an option. However, the lack of consideration of the estrogen niche in ovarian tissue significantly reduces the therapeutic efficacy, with an unclear mechanism in the MSCs in POI treatment. Furthermore, the disruption of circadian rhythm associated with POI has not been previously addressed. Conditioned medium (CM) and estradiol-conditioned medium (E2-CM) were generated from estrogen receptor positive MSCs (ER The secretome of ER This study is the first to demonstrate that, in considering the estrogen niche in ovarian tissue, an estrogen-priming ER The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12929-024-01085-8.","Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also referred to as premature ovarian failure (POF), is characterized by an irreversible decline in ovarian function and estrogen levels in women younger than 40 years [ The typical manifestations of a decrease or loss of folliculogenesis are an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (to menopausal levels [> 40 mIU/ml]) [ Chemotherapy is a major contributor to POI development. Chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, such as DNA double-stranded breaks, can induce the apoptosis of granulosa cells and oocytes in the ovaries [ Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is widely used in cancer treatment because its metabolite, phosphoramide mustard, exhibits anticancer properties [ Estrogen was demonstrated to regulate the peripheral tissue clock and metabolic rhythm [ Clinical trials have utilized stem cell therapy, particularly mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, to treat patients with POI. To date, 29 clinical trials have reported on the use of autologous or allogeneic MSCs for POI treatment ( In the present study, considering the estrogen niche in ovarian tissues, we identified MSCs from human placenta choriodecidual membrane tissues that express ERs (ER In the present study, human placentas were donated by women who received cesarean sections in Taipei Medical University Hospital with procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board at Taipei Medical University (IRB Approval No. TMU-JIRB 201501063 and TMU-JIRB N202304143). Written informed consent was obtained from all donors and experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The pcMSCs from human placental tissues (provided by Prof. Thai-Yen Ling’s Lab in National Taiwan University) were isolated and characterized as described in our previous study [ To investigate the differences in protein concentrations between CM and E2-CM, pcMSCs were cultured in serum-free MCDB201 medium; for this procedure the seeding number (5 × 10 Cells from the human granulosa-like cell line (KGN, RCB1154), a steroidogenic human granulosa cell line, were purchased from RIKEN Bioresource Centre (Tsukuba, Japan).

Pre-chilled 24-well plates were coated with the matrix (50 µL/cm To establish an in vitro granulosa cell injury model, the KGN cells were seeded and cultivated upon reaching 50–60% confluence, after which they were treated with 4-OOH-CP (8 µg/ml) for 12 h to induce cell apoptosis and senescence. The 4-OOH-CP-treated KGN cells were cultured with basic medium (DMEM/F12 mixed with 20% MCDB201 medium) and divided into three groups, namely the Mock group (supplemented with basic medium), CM group (supplemented with CM), and E2-CM group (supplemented with E2-CM).

The CTX-induced mouse POI model was established per the protocol described previously [ We performed actimetry according to established procedures [ The collected ovaries were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C for 24 h. The specimens were then dehydrated, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin wax, serially sectioned into 5-μm-thick slices, and mounted on glass slides. Hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed on every tenth sample from three consecutive slides, sampled from a total of 20 ovaries across 4 experimental groups ( Ovarian and SCN tissues, pcMSCs, and KGN cells were collected and homogenized, and their total RNA was isolated using an EasyPure Total RNA Spin Kit (Bioman Scientific, Taiwan) per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). We synthesized cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT, M1705, Promega, USA). Ovary RNA (2000 ng) and SCN RNA (400 ng) were mixed with a reverse transcriptase master mix in a final volume of 25 μL. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 50°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 10 min. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 96-well plates on a LightCycler 96 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) by using the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (15,350,929, Applied Biosystems, MA, USA). PCR reactions were conducted using a mixture comprising 5 μL of SYBR Green I Master, 2.5 μL of RNAse-free water, 2 μL of 30 nM primer mix, and 0.5 μL of cDNA for a total volume of 10 μL. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial cycle was performed for 20 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles for 10 s at 95°C, 20 s at 60°C, and 20 s at 72°C. Melting curve analyses for determining the dissociation of PCR products were performed at between 65 and 95°C. The PCR efficiencies of the primers was evaluated by examining the samples through the use of six standards in triplicate (diluted in fivefold series). Two reference genes ( The collected cells and ovaries were lysed with RIPA buffer (Energenesis Biomedical, Taiwan) along with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Total protein solutions were obtained by centrifuging the lysed samples at 14,000 rpm for 25 min at 4°C. The protein concentration was detected using the Pierce BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein (30 µg) in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer were separated by applying electrophoresis to 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel, after which the separated proteins were transferred to pure polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon, Merck Millipore, Germany). The membranes were placed in 5% skimmed milk for 1 h to block nonspecific binding and were then incubated with corresponding primary antibodies (Table S2). They were then washed three times with tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer (Bioman, Taiwan) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Bioshop, Canada). After undergoing rinsing, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:3000). Finally, they were visualized using Immobilon Western (Millipore, Germany) and imaged using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare, USA).

Slides were incubated in a heating chamber at 60°C for 30 min, immersed in xylene, and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min at 98°C for antigen retrieval and were subsequently washed with TBS and permeabilization with TBST (0.2% Tween 20 in TBS solution). These sections were then blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, S-1000, USA) for 1 h. After blocking, the slides were incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: CYP19A1 (Abcam, ab18995, UK), PER2 (Abcam, ab227727, UK), RORA (Proteintech, 10616-1-AP, USA), and Rev-Erbα (NR1D1, Proteintech, 13906-1-AP, USA). Subsequently, they were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, USA) for 1 h. Finally, the sections were stained with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine substrates (Vector Laboratories, USA). For confocal fluorescence detection, the slides were subjected to incubation overnight with mouse anti-PCNA (Chemicon, CBL407, Germany) or double staining with cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, #9961, USA) by using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (TUNEL assay, Roche, Cat. No.11684817910, Switzerland). Double immunofluorescence staining was also performed using antibodies against CD31 (550274, BD Pharmingen, USA) and VEGF-A (ab183100, Abcam, UK). On the next day, after being washed with TBST, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor-594–labeled goat anti-mouse IgG/goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, USA) and then counterstained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Fluorescence signals were detected using a Stellaris 8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). KGN cell cultures grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% newly prepared paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with cold TBST for 10 min, and incubated with a blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum in TBST for 1 h. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies for the proteins: Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580, UK) and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, #9961, USA). Subsequently, the coverslips were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (Life Technologies, USA), and F-actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (Invitrogen, A12381, USA). Fluorescence signals were detected using a confocal Stellaris 8 microscope (Leica, Germany). Table S2 presents the experimental conditions for the antibodies used for Western blotting or immunostaining. To perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), serum samples were obtained from the mice in each experimental group to evaluate the levels of AMH (MBS2507173, MyBioSource, CA, USA), E2 (MBS261250, MyBioSource, CA, USA), and FSH (MBS2507988, MyBioSource, CA, USA). Fresh CM and E2-CM from four consecutive passages were used to quantify angiogenin (ELH-ANG, Raybiotech, GA, USA). All assays were conducted using ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’ instructions. KGN cells were treated with Allophycocyanin (APC) Annexin V in a staining buffer containing propidium iodide (BioLegend, USA) per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The samples were analyzed using a BD FACSVerse system and the software BD FACSuite (CA, USA). The cytokines in CM/E2-CM were detected using antibody array-based technology (Human Cytokine Arrays C5, RayBiotech, USA). Each array was incubated with CM/E2-CM (700 µg/ml) at 4°C overnight in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals on the membranes were imaged using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare, USA). Integrated densities were measured using ImageJ 1.53u. The samples were normalized on the basis of six spots of positive controls and the background of the surrounding area. To obtain the exosomes in CM and E2-CM, the ER Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol LS reagent (10296010, Invitrogen, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by using a spectrophotometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop Technology, USA) to measure absorbance at 260 nm. The quantity of RNA was evaluated by using a LabChip RNA 6000 kit (Agilent Technologies, USA) and the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology). Sample libraries were prepared using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit (Qiagen, Germany) per the manufacturer’s guidelines, and subsequently they were sequenced using an Illumina instrument (75-cycle single-end read, 75SE). The miRNA data obtained in the present study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE247568. The collected sequencing data were analyzed using the Illumina BCL2FASTQ v2.20 software (Illumina, USA) for demultiplexing. We used Trimmomatic to isolate high-quality reads, discarding those shorter than 18 nucleotides [ Total exosomal RNA extracted above, including miRNA, was used to conduct quantitative analysis of miRNA by qPCR. cDNA was synthesized using the miRCURY LNA RT Kit (Cat#339340, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the miScript HiSpec Buffer in the kit, allowing selective conversion of mature miRNAs but not precursors. Mature miRNAs were polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase and reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo-dT primers. Polyadenylation and reverse transcription were performed in parallel in the same tube. The expression of the miRNAs of interest was assessed via qPCR using the miRCURY LNA SYBR Green PCR kit (Cat#339345 Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). U6 (RNU6-1) snRNA was chosen as the internal control for microRNAs. Primers were designed based on a miRNA-specific stem loop-RT assay [ All experiments were performed at least three times. The collected data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.3, USA) and were presented as means ± SDs. An unpaired Student’s  The effects of CTX on the POI-associated ovarian morphology, sex hormones, and mouse body weight were analyzed. As presented in Supplementary Fig. 1, the CTX-induced POI mice exhibited significant weight loss (Fig. S1A), reduced ovary size, poor ovarian morphology (Fig. S1B), impaired folliculogenesis (Fig. S1C and D), decreased serum E2 and AMH levels, increased serum FSH levels (Fig. S1E), and decreased CYP19A1 protein levels (Fig. S1F). These results indicate the successful establishment of a CTX-induced POI mouse model. Estrogen is produced by granulosa cells. It stimulates ovarian folliculogenesis and plays a key role in the interaction between granulosa cells and surrounding niche cells [ We previously demonstrated that pcMSC (same source as ER The mice were divided into four groups, namely the control group comprising healthy controls, the POI group comprising CTX-induced POI mice, the CM group comprising POI mice treated with CM, and the E2-CM group comprising POI mice treated with E2-CM. The POI mice were intraperitoneally injected with PBS, CM, or E2-CM. The experimental designs are presented shown in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM improved ovary function in CTX-induced POI animal model.  To determine the effects of CM/E2-CM on ovarian damage due to CTX-induced POI, immunohistochemical staining for PCNA was performed; PCNA is an indicator of cell proliferation. As revealed in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM protected GCs from apoptosis in CTX-induced POI animal model. To elucidate the effects of CM and E2-CM on granulosa cell apoptosis, the human KGN granulosa cell line was used to establish an in vitro cell model (Fig. S3A). In the present study, 4-OOH-CP (8 μg/ml), an active form of CTX, was employed to test the effects of CM and E2-CM (Fig. S3B). The flow cytometry analysis results reveal that, when compared with the 4-OOH-CP-treated KGN cells (Mock group), those treated with CM or E2-CM exhibited significantly reduced 4-OOH-CP-induced early and late cell apoptosis (Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore granulosa cell viability in CTX-challenged KGN cell model.  Estrogen is closely associated with circadian rhythm regulation [ Figure  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore ovarian circadian rhythm in CTX-induced POI animal model.  We analyzed the gene expression related to estrogen biosynthesis ( Moreover, cells expressing  As was true with  The impact of CM and E2-CM on the expression of circadian proteins REV-ERBα and E4BP4 in ovarian granulosa cells was further validated through immunofluorescence staining using KGN cells in vitro. Our findings revealed that the CTX analog 4-OOH-CP significantly increased nuclear REV-ERBα levels, while CM/E2-CM effectively attenuated this effect of 4-OOH-CP (Fig.  We hypothesized that the interplay between circadian rhythm disruptions and the components contributing to POI can be reflected in circadian locomotor rhythms. The disruptive effect of CTX and the repairing effects of CM and E2-CM were studied by examining the locomotor activity in POI mice. The experimental design is detailed in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore period in locomotor activity in CTX-induced POI animal model.  Neovascularization plays a key role in ovarian hormone production and folliculogenesis. To investigate the potential role of CM and E2-CM in restoring CTX-induced angiogenesis defect in vivo, the protein levels of CD31 (a marker for vascular differentiation) and VEGF-A in ovarian tissues subjected to different experimental conditions were analyzed. We discovered that CTX treatment considerably reduced the protein levels of CD31 and VEGF-A in the ovarian tissues of the experimental mice, and that CM and E2-CM treatments significantly restored the CTX-induced defects (Fig.  CM and E2-CM promoted angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, possibly with angiogenin involvement. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying the aforementioned findings, cytokine array analysis was performed to identify the cytokines of CM and E2-CM that might be involved in angiogenesis (angiogenin and TNFRSF11), extracellular matrix regulation (TIMP1 and TIMP2), immunoregulation (CCL2 and CCL7), and cell growth (IL-8 and IGFBP2) (Fig.  To investigate whether angiogenin plays a role in CM/E2-CM-induced angiogenesis, HUVEC cells were treated with CM or E2-CM supplemented with or without angiogenin-neutralizing antibodies. Compared with the negative control (basal medium only), the CM and E2-CM groups exhibited the same effects experienced by the positive control with respect to the promotion of HUVEC tube formation. Neutralizing angiogenin in CM and E2-CM significantly suppressed the effects of CM and E2-CM on angiogenesis with respect to total tube length and total branch points (Fig.  The key role of exosomes in CM in regulating CTX-induced POI and circadian rhythm disorders was further investigated using a 4-OOH-CP-treated human KGN granulosa cell model in vitro. The experimental groups included the control group (Control group), the groups challenged with 4-OOH-CP then treated with: MDCD201 mock medium only (Mock group), exosome-depleted conditioned medium (Exo-/CM group), exosomes only (Exo group), and conditioned medium (CM group). We assessed the protein levels of C-Casp3 and PCNA (indicators of granulosa cell apoptosis and proliferation, Fig.  ER To further identify the potential molecular exosomal factors responsible for the therapeutic efficacy, the exosomal miRNAs present in CM and E2-CM were analyzed. As shown in Supplementary Figure S6, the E2-CM group showed a significant higher exosome counts then the CM group (Fig. S6A). The overall miRNA profiles in CM and E2-CM showed that there are miRNA candidates associated with apoptosis, POI, estrogen production, circadian rhythm modulation, and estrogen-circadian rhythm interactions (Figs. S6B–F). Figure  pcMSC Exosomal miRNA Profile.  The results pertaining to the interactions between miRNAs and their target genes are presented in Table  Putative interactions between miRNAs and their targets For each target gene of interest, only the top two most abundant miRNAs with a TargetScan Context++ score of ≤ – 0.2 are included. The data in the table were sourced from TargetScan 8.0, and gene names, along with the pairing sequences between target genes and miRNAs, are highlighted in red The expression levels of potential miRNA candidates in each group were further quantified using Q-RT PCR analysis. We found that E2 priming enhances the expression of miRNAs of ER The unique biosignature of ER-expressing MSCs in repairing POI and circadian rhythm disruption was further demonstrated by comparing the exosomal miRNA profiles of ER-positive MSCs (pcMSCs) with those of ER-negative MSCs (BMMSCs, ADMSCs, and WJ-MSCs (Data were referenced from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE153752 ( The present study is the first to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the secretome derived from niche-responsive estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) human placenta–derived MSCs (ER The potential therapeutic effects of MSCs on POI have been reported in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition to MSCs, CM obtained from various MSC types have been shown to effectively restore ovarian function in chemical-induced POI through various mechanisms. For example, CM derived from human umbilical cord MSCs has been demonstrated to improve the ovarian reserve of the premenopausal ovary through paracrine growth factors such as HGF, VEGF, and IGF-1 [ We found that CTX led to significant alterations in ovary size, morphology, and function, including poor folliculogenesis and low E2 levels. Specifically, pcMSCs expressed ERα to respond to the estrogen in the ovarian niche. Treatment with CM and E2-CM derived from ER Studies have reported that  We assessed the CYP19A1 and CYP11A1 protein levels in ovarian tissues at ZT8 and ZT4, and our results indicate that CM and E2-CM treatment effectively reversed the CTX-induced suppression of CYP19A1 and CYP11A1. Similarly, CM and E2-CM restored the CTX-induced suppression of RORA protein levels in ovarian tissues at ZT4. The expression patterns of REV-ERB The exosomal miRNAs in CM and E2-CM apparently play a key role in reversing the effects of CTX on ovarian function and circadian rhythm disruption. miRNAs have been regarded as potential targeted therapeutic drugs because of their ability to regulate mRNA expression. Researchers have used several miRNAs to treat POI in mouse models, specifically targeting the genes of primordial follicle activation ( In the present study, we demonstrated the effects of CM and E2-CM on CTX-induced apoptosis and Caspase-3 expression in granulosa cells in vivo (Fig.  Female reproductive function is regulated by under the circadian rhythms of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, which help maintain ovarian hormone secretion and a regular reproductive cycle [ Our study demonstrates the effects of CM and E2-CM on CTX-induced circadian rhythm disorder involving the clock proteins RORA, REV-ERBα, E4BP4, DBP (Fig.  The expression levels of certain miRNAs were notably elevated in both CM and E2-CM samples. Specifically, let-7a-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7i-5p, and miR-24-3p were associated with the regulation of apoptosis and estrogen synthesis, while miR-199a-5p, miR-199b-5p, miR-24-3p, and miR-191-5p were linked to the regulation of circadian rhythm. Additionally, miR-29a-3p and miR-16-5p played a role in follicle activation. These findings highlight the potential direction of miRNA therapy for POI and POI-related circadian rhythm disorder. The estrogen responding ER The coordinated time-dependent action of the HPG axis has been reported to maintain physiological hormone secretion and reproductive function in accordance with the diurnal cycle. It is directly involved in the regulation of ovarian steroid-associated genes such as  The present study is the first to demonstrate that the pcMSC secretome (with or without E2 priming) can respond to the ovarian niche and effectively restore ovarian failure and circadian rhythm disruption both in vitro and in vivo.

11468102,Three-dimensional Analysis of Facial Asymmetry in Unilateral Lambdoid Craniosynostosis,"Unilateral lambdoid synostosis (ULS) is characterized by occipital flattening, mastoid bulging, and contralateral parietal bossing. Anterior craniofacial features are less well-defined. This study utilizes volumetric, craniometric, and composite heat maps of three-dimensional (3D) rendered CT scans to analyze anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS and compared to controls. A retrospective review of three-dimensional CT scans. Tertiary care pediatric institution. 30 ULS and 30 control patients. Volumetric and craniometric analysis of the anterior fossa, orbits, zygomas, maxilla, and mandible was performed. The anterior fossa volume was greater bilaterally (0.047, 0.038), and the fossa angle was more anterior contralaterally (<0.001) and more anterior bilaterally than controls (0.038, 0.033). The orbits had greater height and lesser depth bilaterally compared to controls (0.006, 0.009; < 0.001, < 0.001). Zygoma length was significantly greater on the contralateral side than controls (0.048; < 0.001). Nasal contralateral deviation of 3.57  ±  1.97°. The maxillary length was longer on the contralateral side (0.045). The mandibular angle was more anterior on the ipsilateral side and posterior on the contralateral side (<0.001) compared to controls (0.042, < 0.001). Chin had a contralateral deviation of 1.04  ±  3.74°. ULS has significant asymmetry in the anterior craniofacial skeleton. There is a bilateral expansion of the anterior cranial fossa with greater frontal bossing on the contralateral side. Increased orbital height and decreased depth. Contralateral zygomatic and mandibular body lengthening with posterior mandibular deviation. These features may provide more effective diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies.","Unilateral lambdoid synostosis is the least common form of single suture craniosynostosis, accounting for only 1 to 4% of all cases. Most of the morphometric studies evaluating unilateral lambdoid synostosis have primarily focused on alterations in the middle and posterior cranial vault; a few small studies have begun to describe some of the anterior craniofacial features. Previously, the laterality of frontal bossing had been used in the differentiation of synostosis and deformational plagiocephaly. Features of facial asymmetry appear to persist following surgery; therefore, it is worthwhile to perform a comprehensive analysis to understand better the complex anterior deformational changes in this rare condition. Retrospective CT scan analysis of 30 patients diagnosed with ULS following institutional review board approval by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All CT images were obtained pre-operatively, and no patient with a synostosis-related syndrome, positional plagiocephaly, or any other craniofacial malformation was included. An additional 30 age- and gender-matched control subjects’ images without pathological findings were analyzed for comparison. The average age of the ULS group was 1.84  ±  2.25 years and the control group were 1.85  ±  2.24 years. In both groups 16 were male and 14 were female. Right sided laterality was present in 17 patients and left sided in 13. Metopic ridge was present in 13 patients. CT images were converted to three-dimensional skeletal models using Mimics 22.0 (Materialise, Belgium) and then analyzed using 3-Matic 15.0 (Materialise, Belgium). Volumetric data was collected from 3-Matic 15.0 (Materialise, Belgium). The anterior fossa volume was separated by tracing along the edge of the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone to the edge of the cranial vault. The anterior fossa was further split into left, and right-sided volumes separated by a plane through the anterior nasal spine and sella turcica ( Volumetric segmentation of the orbit, zygoma, mandible, and anterior cranial fossa. The three-dimensional rendered skeletal models were analyzed by measuring various craniometric distances and angles. The anterior fossa angle was measured between the mid-sagittal plane and the lesser wing of the sphenoid ( Orbital landmarks (top left), zygomatic measures (top right), zygomatic angle (bottom left), and nasal deviation (bottom right).

Mandibular volume was not significantly different shown in  Heat maps created from overlaid right sided ULS and control patient group composites are shown in  Premature closure of the lambdoid suture profoundly affects skull growth, resulting in significant asymmetry of the cranial base, calvarium, and facial skeleton. Although many of the characteristic deformities in ULS are well documented in the literature, previous studies have primarily focused on calvarium and cranial base morphological changes. The current study provides a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS patients, employing a combination of volumetric, craniometric, and composite heat map analysis using preoperative three-dimensional rendered CT scans. This approach allows for a more detailed and accurate assessment of the anterior craniofacial features in ULS patients than previously reported. The relatively large cohort of 30 patients enables us to draw more robust conclusions regarding anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS patients. These novel findings enhance our understanding of this rare condition's complex anterior deformational changes, ultimately informing more effective diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies. Reports of anterior cranial morphology in ULS have been inconsistent in previous studies and have described ipsilateral and contralateral frontal bossing cases. While orbital dysmorphology is a documented feature in craniosynostosis of other major sutures, particularly metopic and coronal synostosis, this has not previously been described in lambdoid synostosis. When examining the midfacial structures, the zygoma length was significantly longer on the contralateral side compared to the ipsilateral side. This indicates midface protrusion on the contralateral side of the face in ULS patients. This had previously been theorized by Smartt et al., who speculated that anterior displacement of the mandible on the ipsilateral side might coincide with anterior displacement of the midface and lengthening of the zygoma on the contralateral side. The results of the lower facial analysis are consistent with the findings of previous studies and demonstrate that mandibular angles at the articular fossa were all increased on the contralateral side, which appears to reflect a posterior shift of the cranial base on the contralateral side. Notably, 43% (13 out of 30) of our patients with ULS exhibited visible metopic ridging on skeletal CT images. Benign metopic ridge is thought to be present in 10-25% of infants as a variant of normal, which raises the question if the increased incidence in our study population is more than coincidental. Traditionally, surgical correction for ULS has focused on reshaping the posterior cranium. Depending on the patient's age, this may involve endoscopic strip craniectomy or open posterior cranial vault remodeling. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex anterior craniofacial deformations in patients with ULS when planning surgical management. Although our study does not explicitly propose a surgical technique or staged procedures, our results contribute to the ongoing discussion about the most appropriate surgical management for ULS patients. By incorporating a comprehensive understanding of anterior craniofacial asymmetry into the decision-making process, clinicians can develop more targeted and individualized treatment plans that address each patient's specific needs. Future research should focus on evaluating the outcomes of various surgical approaches in the context of these findings. Unilateral lambdoid synostosis results in a significant asymmetry in the anterior craniofacial skeleton. There is compensatory contralateral superior and midface protrusion found with frontal bossing and increased zygomatic protrusion. Orbital height expansion with decreased depth. There exists midline deviation toward the contralateral side in both the nose and the chin. In the lower third the ipsilateral side has increased protrusion in the mandible and in the body length. An increased incidence of the benign metopic ridge was also observed in our cohort. These findings in the anterior cranium, orbits, midface, and mandible should be considered for diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies.","['craniosynostosis', 'craniofacial morphology', 'facial morphology']",2023-5-17,The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal,"""std"""
11468025,Transfusion burden and willingness to pay for temporary alleviation of anemia status in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients in China,"Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) is one of the global public health concerns highlighted by the World Health Organization. Patients with TDT require regular blood transfusion to survive. However, the availability of blood resources is extremely limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate transfusion burden and willingness to pay (WTP) for temporary remission of anemia status among patients with TDT and to explore the associated factors. Adult patients with TDT were recruited through cluster sampling across several high-incidence provinces in China. Consenting patients completed online questionnaires on demographic information, transfusion burden and WTP with real-time WeChat communication assistance from researchers. The guiding techniques of double-bounded dichotomous choices and open-ended questions in the contingent valuation method (CVM) were used to obtain participants’ WTP for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. WTP calculations were performed using maximum likelihood estimation, with further insights gained through subgroup analysis based on gender, family monthly income level and convenience of blood transfusion. The analysis included 149 TDT patients from five high-incidence provinces, with an average monthly income of $198.5. Patients received an average of 3.7 units per transfusion, 15.4 times annually, with an average WTP of $70.4 per unit (95% CI [62.0, 78.9]). Estimated WTP for temporary anemia alleviation per transfusion totaled $260.6, exceeding monthly income by 1.32 times. Higher WTP was observed among males, higher-income households, and those with at least junior education. Lower WTP was noted among patients with lower transfusion volumes and those needing to travel for transfusion or during hospitalization for blood transfusion. High WTP indicated a strong desire for temporary anemia relief. Most TDT patients faced significant economic and transfusion burden. The evident gap in meeting clinical needed underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments to reduce transfusion dependency, potentially transforming TDT care and improving socioeconomic well-being and clinical outcomes. These findings supported evidence-based decision-making for TDT pharmacoeconomics and efficient healthcare resource allocation in China. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11547-2. 
 In China, patients generally had low economic levels and faced high transfusion burden and severe challenges in obtaining transfusion. They received an average of 1.4 blood transfusions per month. In addition, 25.5% of patients did not receive regular transfusion, and 91.9% experienced delayed transfusions. Chinese transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) patients, aiming to temporarily alleviate anemic conditions, were willing to pay up to RMB 513.5 (USD 70.4) for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. This finding may provide valuable insights for future health economic studies focused on TDT. Male gender, higher household income, and education beyond junior high school were correlated with higher WTP. Additionally, patients with lower single-transfusion volumes and more convenience of blood transfusion exhibited higher WTP. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11547-2.","β-thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder marked by ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia of varying severity, the overall prevalence is 2.21% in China [ China’s blood supply has faced a'tight balance,' with shortages that are seasonal, structural, and regional. The red blood cell distribution rate per thousand people, a measure of blood institutions’ clinical supply capacity, stood significantly lower than the global average, at 11.1 donations per thousand in 2020 and 3.4 milliliters of red blood cells per capita [ In China, blood is not a commodity. It is collected by blood stations, which are non-profit organizations, and used exclusively for clinical purposes without any trade. Since 2005, a uniform national fee for blood has been in place, with a standard charge of RMB 220 for 200 milliliters. This regulation significantly ensured the safety of blood transfusions. However, the blood price may not reflect its true value. If the price of blood was the sole criterion, the monetary value of blood for patients could be underestimated, potentially impacting the development of innovative technologies aimed at reducing transfusion burden. Standardized blood transfusion and chelation therapy were major challenges for many developing countries and represent major and unsustainable health burden [ WTP elicitation methods are crucial techniques for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of CVM assessment [ The data were collected from adult TDT patient samples in five high-prevalence provinces in China [ In this study, “anemia status” referred to the state in which patients exhibited anemia symptoms and required blood transfusions for life sustenance. To clarify this concept for participants, the questionnaire was developed with insights from six leading hematologists across China, who concurred that blood transfusion is pivotal for temporary relief from anemia—a concept easily understood by patients as essential for their health. Therefore, the measurement of the willingness of TDT patients to pay for a unit of blood was chosen, reflecting their willingness to temporarily alleviate anemia. The pilot survey confirmed that patients had a positive understanding of the questionnaire. As the payment unit for WTP, this study focused on 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted suspended red blood cells due to: (1) the recommendation in the 2022 Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia, which prescribed these cells for TDT patients unless autoimmune hemolytic anemia necessitates washed red cells [ This study designed a questionnaire, which was composed of two sections (as detailed in the Supplementary File). The first section encompassed 44 items, concentrating on patient demographics and the burden of transfusion. In this section, the part on blood transfusion treatment-related information comprised details such as the number of units transfused in a single session, the frequency of annual transfusions, the need for hospitalization, experiences with anemia, and chelation therapy. This section was designed to gather information about the patient’s transfusion history and aided in the recollection of the transfusion experiences. It also aimed to facilitate patients’ mental engagement with the treatment scenario, enhancing their comprehension of the subsequent sections related to WTP. The second section of the questionnaire focused on the WTP. CVM was used to examine TDT patients’ WTP for temporarily alleviating anemia status. The formal survey employed the double-bounded dichotomous choices based on the predetermined bids which were determined by the pre-survey using open-ended questions. In the scenario where blood transfusion offered temporary relief from anemia and no other temporary relief was available, interviewees answered two rounds of questions to assess their acceptance of the bid for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. The term ‘bid’ referred to the proposed price that participants were asked to consider in their WTP evaluations. If respondents answered ‘yes’ to the initial bid (Bid The dichotomous choice method. Bid To explore the WTP of patients under ideal conditions, this study examined patients’ WTP under conditions both with and without economic constraints. Except for the consideration of economic limitations, the descriptions for the two scenarios were otherwise identical. This required participants to provide answers for both scenarios at each set of bids. Eligible participants were those diagnosed with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and willing to participate. Exclusion criteria encompassed the inability to independently complete the questionnaire due to health or cognitive impairments and those prescribed washed red blood cells for transfusion. Given the rare nature of this disease and the lack of incidence data across provinces in China, coupled with their typically close communication with medical institutions due to the need for long-term transfusions, a convenience sampling approach was adopted. Furthermore, a snowball sampling method was utilized to identify additional participants, which involved asking patients to post recruitment notices in WeChat groups, thereby expanding the sample size to 149 patients. The local hospital hematology department directors explained the nature and purpose of the investigation. Patients who consented to participate were then contacted by trained investigators through WeChat. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data for the questionnaire were collected using the WJX platform (www.wjx.cn). The survey instrument, developed by the research team in Chinese, was subjected to a thorough evaluation process. This involved consultation with six hematology department directors from major tertiary hospitals and four health economics professors. Experts provided recommendations for refining the guided scenarios and minimizing interpretive ambiguity in the questions. After two rounds of revision, all experts deemed the questionnaire to have satisfactory validity and reliability. A pilot survey was then conducted with 20 patients to assess the questionnaire’s rationality, understandability, and readability. Following this survey, researchers conducted one-on-one interviews with participants to ensure accurate comprehension of the questionnaire items. Subsequently, the study conducted both a pre-survey and a formal survey. The surveys were administered by three interviewers who had undergone two days of training and were familiar with the questionnaire, under the supervision of two public health experts. Consistency and completeness checks were performed after the questionnaire was submitted. Mean, variance and frequency were used for descriptive statistics.

 Patients’ WTP in pre-survey RMB 589 (SD = 1123) [USD 81(SD = 154)] RMB 658 (SD = 1111) [USD 90 (SD = 152)]  The bids, as detailed in Table  Design of bids Twenty TDT patients, with an average age of 26.2 years (SD = 6.5), participated in the pre-survey. Among these participants, 55% were male. Appendix  Formal survey questionnaires were obtained from 149 TDT patients across five provinces in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan and Guizhou. The patients had an average age of 26.2 years (SD = 9.0), and 31.5% of them were students. Most patients (78.5%) had an educational background below a bachelor’s degree. A total of 28.2% of patients were unemployed or without employment, 46.3% of the patients had no income at all, and 85.2% of the patients had a monthly per capita family income below RMB 5,000 (USD 685.9). Excluding students, the personal income of other patients was RMB 1979.9 (SD = 1601.7), equivalent to USD 271.6 (The exchange rate on November 13, 2023, was 1 USD = 7.29 RMB). Patients’ self-perceived health status was classified into four levels: “poor,” “fair,” “good,” and “excellent”. Of these, 77.2% of patients rated their health status as “poor” or “fair”. Regarding the current transfusion situation, patients had an average transfusion burden of 3.7 units per single blood transfusion (SD = 1.2) and an annual transfusion frequency of 15.4 times (SD = 11.2). In terms of transfusion history, 25.5% self-reported that they did not receive regular or adequate transfusions, and 28.9% received transfusions in different locations, taking an average of 2.5 days per transfusion including pre and post transfusion. A total of 75.2% of the patients required hospitalization for blood transfusions, 76% of whom mentioned complex admission procedures Delayed transfusions were reported by 91.9% of patients, with the longest delays averaging 41.3 days (median 30 days). Hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 9 g/dl were observed in 67.1% of participants, and 36.2% perceived a timely blood supply as inadequate. Moreover, 83.9% of patients experienced insufficient blood supply during a single transfusion. Symptoms reported included weakness (65.1%), delayed growth (37.6%), and heart failure signs (10.1%). Patients underwent iron monitoring every 4.3 months, on average (SD = 4.5). Deferasirox was the most commonly used iron chelator (59.7%), followed by deferoxamine (26.2%). Patient details are presented in Table  
 Basic patient information and transfusion burden Following randomization, 74 patients participated in the survey for the first set of bidding scenarios, and 75 patients engaged with the second set. Table  
 Patient response statistics  Considering their own economic circumstances, TDT patients had an average WTP of RMB 513.5 per unit of leukocyte-depleted suspended red blood cells (95% CI [452.0-575.0], equivalent to USD 70.4). Furthermore, the study endeavored to assess patients’ WTP without considering economic levels. Consequently, the average WTP reported by patients was RMB 1,104.1 (95% CI [931.5-1276.7]), equivalent to USD 151.5. See Table  Estimates of WTP ¥513.5 ($70.4) 31.4 (4.3) ¥1104.1 ($151.5) 88.1 (12.1) To explore the determinants of WTP for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells, the basic model incorporated all possible factors (variable definitions in Appendix  
 Expanded model results *** The subgroup analysis results are presented in Table  Results of subgroup analysis The results of the gender subgroup analysis indicated that male patients showed a higher WTP than female patients. Female patients were willing to pay RMB 444.8 per unit of blood (95% CI [373.0-516.5]), equivalent to USD 61.0, while male patients were willing to pay RMB 580.5 per unit of blood (95% CI [480.2-680.8]), equivalent to USD 79.6. The monthly household income subgroup analysis revealed that, in general, patients with higher monthly household incomes expressed a higher WTP per unit of blood. Specifically, patients with monthly per capita incomes at or below RMB 3,000 were willing to pay RMB 448.2 per unit of blood (95% CI [365.4-531.2]), equivalent to USD 61.5. And those with incomes between RMB 3,001–5,000 were willing to pay RMB 465.1 (95% CI [379.1-551.2]), equivalent to USD 63.8. Patients with incomes of RMB 5,001 or above presented the highest WTP at RMB 906.0. (95% CI [686.0-1126.0]), equivalent to USD 124.3. The convenience of blood transfusion subgroup analyses revealed that patients with less convenient access to blood transfusion demonstrated a higher WTP. In this study, convenience of blood transfusion was measured by whether hospitalization was required and whether blood transfusion needed to be performed in a different location. The WTP for patients with convenient access to blood transfusion was RMB 529.4 (95% CI [458.3-600.6]), equivalent to USD 72.6. In contrast, the WTP for patients with inconvenient access to blood transfusion was RMB 457.4 (95% CI [339.4-575.3]), equivalent to USD 62.7. This study investigated transfusion burden and WTP for temporary relief from anemia among adult TDT patients in high-prevalence areas by analyzing factors influencing WTP. From the results, it was clear that patients place a high value on anemia relief, regardless of their financial situation, indicating a significant WTP for health improvements. Patient gender, age, household income, and the number of units transfused in a single session were also associated with their WTP. Adult TDT patients, frequently of lower socioeconomic status, bore a considerable disease-related financial strain, predominantly due to the increasing costs of clinical transfusion and iron chelation therapy with age [ Furthermore, the hospital admission process, necessitating navigation across multiple departments, was cited as onerous by numerous respondents, significantly consuming time and energy. Moreover, in light of blood shortages, some hospitals enforced strict criteria, requiring patients to exhibit low hemoglobin levels or additional medical complications to qualify for inpatient blood transfusions. Thus, the standardization of clinical blood management protocols could markedly alleviate the burden associated with transfusion. Even though patients had a low economic status, they consistently faced high disease burden. Their WTP for temporary relief from anemia was still high, and their actual payment willingness may be higher due to costs beyond the blood itself. On average, each patient received 3.7 units of blood per transfusion session, with an annual average of 15.4 transfusion sessions. The WTP of RMB 1,900 (USD 260.6) for survival in a single session and RMB 29,259 (USD 4,013.6) annually for temporary relief from anemia could be roughly calculated. However, a single transfusion involves more than just the value of the blood itself. It also includes various costs, such as pretransfusion tests to prevent immunological reactions, medical equipment costs, hospitalization costs, and iron chelation costs. This study found that elderly and higher-income patients exhibited a higher WTP, consistent with previous research [ The amount of blood transfusion and its convenience also influence patients’ WTP. Patients who required a greater number of units of blood in a single transfusion session expressed a lower WTP. The increase in the number of blood transfusion units led to higher economic burden. Consequently, patients may reduce their WTP for each unit of blood due to concerns about the high medical costs. Additionally, as the volume of transfused blood increases, the marginal health benefits per unit of blood may diminish, resulting in a decreased WTP among patients. Patients with more convenient blood transfusions exhibited a higher WTP. This could be attributed to the fact that the convenience of blood transfusions may enhance psychological comfort and reduce anxiety associated with the procedure, thereby increasing WTP. Furthermore, convenient transfusion conditions may save patients additional costs such as transportation, examination, and cost of hospitalization, thus potentially increasing their WTP for blood. These findings suggested that when formulating medical policies and blood transfusion services, it was necessary to consider the economic status and needs of different patient groups. To improve the accessibility and equity of medical services, more support and subsidies may be required for patient groups with weaker economic capabilities. At the same time, improving the convenience of blood transfusion services, such as by optimizing appointment processes and reducing waiting times, may also help to enhance patients’ WTP. This study was the first to investigate patients’ willingness to pay for transfusions to alleviate anemic conditions. The burden of transfusion and TDT patients’ recognition of the value of health could provide data insights for future related health economic research. This study had several limitations. First, for the sake of patient understanding, this study concretized the concept of sustaining life with blood transfusion. However, in reality, the costs of temporarily alleviating their anemia status also included the costs of testing, iron chelation, etc. Blood was only the most crucial component of transfusion therapy, and it may not fully represent patients’ WTP to temporarily alleviate their anemia status. Second, due to limitations in the research conditions, this study employed online questionnaires for data collection, compared to face-to-face interviews, this method may have resulted in less accurate responses. This study investigated transfusion burden of patients and explored the WTP for temporary relief from anemia among patients from Chinese provinces with a high prevalence of TDT. The study pinpointed key determinants of WTP, notably age, gender, income, education, the convenience of blood transfusion and the number of units transfused in a single session. The results indicated that patients exhibit a high WTP for temporary relief from anemia and that thalassemia imposes significant burden of blood transfusion on patients. The evident gap in meeting clinical needs underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments that can lessen transfusion dependency, potentially transforming the care landscape for TDT, improving patients’ socioeconomic well-being, and enhancing overall clinical outcomes. This research contributed to a deeper understanding of TDT’s transfusion burden, serving as a valuable resource for pharmacoeconomic studies and informing effective healthcare resource allocation in China.

Can Multivalent Glycoconjugates Improve
upon Nature’s Design?","Multivalent interactions
between receptors and glycans play an
important role in many different biological processes, including pathogen
infection, self-recognition, and the immune response. The growth in
the number of tools and techniques toward the assembly of multivalent
glycoconjugates means it is possible to create synthetic systems that
more and more closely resemble the diversity and complexity we observe
in nature. In this Perspective we present the background to the recognition
and binding enabled by multivalent interactions in nature, and discuss
the strategies used to construct synthetic glycoconjugate equivalents.
We highlight key discoveries and the current state of the art in their
applications to glycan arrays, vaccines, and other therapeutic and
diagnostic tools, with an outlook toward some areas we believe are
of most interest for future work in this area.","Carbohydrate recognition plays a pivotal
role in many different
biological processes, including cell–cell recognition, pathogenesis
and the immune response. The mammalian cell surface is decorated with
a rich array of complex glycans tethered to membrane-bound proteins A representation
of the diversity in form and function of the glycocalyx.
a) Glycolipids, for example the glycosphingolipid sialyl Lewis x antigen
shown; b) proteoglycans, for example the mucin MUC1, displaying branched  Often these key processes of physiology
and pathology rely on interactions
with multiple copies of a displayed glycan, and this multivalent presentation
furnishes selectivity and avidity not achievable with individual (or
monovalent) interactions. The attractiveness of this precise, yet
tunable molecular recognition has led to the design of biomimetic
systems which exploit the power of multivalent glycan interactions,
for applications in drug discovery, vaccines, diagnostics, and tools
to probe fundamental biological interactions. Despite significant
progress, however, we remain far from achieving the complexity and
intricacy displayed in nature. This perspective will briefly
explore the basis of the potent,
selective yet dynamic recognition and binding enabled by multivalent
glycan presentation, and then introduce the scaffolds commonly utilized
to produce synthetic equivalents. We will highlight key examples of
synthetic systems which harness multivalent glycan interactions in
the context of developing diagnostics, designing vaccines and therapeutics,
and probing biological recognition through glycan arrays. Finally,
we will discuss the outlook for this exciting field, exploring the
key opportunities and challenges presented. It has long been established that multivalent
presentation of recognition
motifs can enable increases in affinity and avidity of recognition
events ( Representations of a) monovalent binding; b) multivalent
binding;
c) reduced enthalpy due to conformational strain associated with multivalent
binding and nonoptimized linker length; and d) impact of increasing
the effective local concentration through multivalent ligand presentation. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, however, complex
carbohydrates
are not created using a templated biosynthesis, and confer macromolecules
with far more structural diversity, owing to their large monomer palette,
multiple attachment points that allow for branching, and variable
enzymatic modification. Lectins are proteins which
bind carbohydrates, and are often complexed
as multimers possessing several recognition sites, with the ability
to interact with multiple copies of the relevant glycan. The idea
that polydentate ligands could form more stable complexes than their
equivalent monodentate ligands (the chelate effect) is a concept that
has long been familiar to supramolecular chemists. The favorable free energy changes of multivalent binding interactions
are driven by the enthalpic and entropic contributions of linked carbohydrate
ligands with a receptor protein. A favorable binding enthalpy is driven
by networks of hydrogen bonds between the carbohydrate ring hydroxyl
groups and amino acid residues, The influence
of a previous binding event upon the enthalpy and
entropy (and therefore free energy) of a subsequent binding eventis
known as cooperativity. Cooperativity is quantified with a parameter
α, which is >1 when cooperativity is synergistic, <1 when
cooperativity is negative and interfering, and =1 when recognition
is noncooperative/additive. The classic biochemical example of positive
cooperativity is the allosteric binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, Even in systems
where subsequent binding is negatively cooperative,
multivalent systems still provide useful degrees of higher-avidity
binding. Many carbohydrate–lectin
interactions are multivalent with
respect to both the carbohydrate and the lectin recognition domain,
furnishing access to multiple binding modes. Multivalent glycoconjugates
may bind to multiple recognition sites on a single lectin, or cross-link
recognition sites on adjacent lectins. It is often difficult to deconvolute
the contribution of these distinct binding modes, particularly in
complex biological systems, yet their impacts may be profound, as
has been demonstrated by a model system exploring recognition of DC-SIGN. There are several suggested reasons
for why nature employs the
multivalent presentation of low-affinity interactions, rather than
many different, specific and high-affinity contacts. First, multivalency
provides a chance to increase binding affinity over a dynamic range,
giving a breadth of response to mono or multivalent ligands, rather
than a simple on/off switch. Finally, multivalent interactions allow for recognition events
and aggregate structures over large surface areas. For example, it
is thought they may play a role in processes such as cell–cell
signaling and tissue structure at the membrane The synthesis of multivalent systems is typically
achieved by conjugation
of an appropriately compatible glycan onto a central or core structure
suitably equipped for multiple points of glycan attachment. Robust
chemistries, such as copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
(CuAAC), amide coupling, Michael addition and oxime or hydrazone ligation
are frequently used as attachment methods ( a) Common attachment methods for the synthesis
of multivalent glycoconjugates.
b) Classification of constructs commonly used to achieve multivalent
glycan presentation. In order to facilitate
multivalent binding, surfaces or macromolecular
scaffolds are often used to present glycans in two or three dimensions,
with a high degree of diversity in the structures used ( The presentation of multiple carbohydrate recognition motifs
on
a synthetic macromolecular scaffold also allows for the use of simplified
carbohydrate structures, A key development in the pursuit of complex
synthetic multivalent
systems was in the automated production of the glycan itself. Automated
glycan assembly (AGA) was pioneered by Seeberger in the early 2000s Chemoenzymatic synthesis, where synthetic building blocks
are assembled
or modified by enzymes, is another strategy which has pushed forward
the production of more complex glycans. Glycan arrays are a high-throughput approach
to screen glycan recognition
capabilities against target proteins or other binding partners of
interest. This technology was pioneered in the early 2000s, with the
noncovalent deposition of glycolipids onto nitrocellulose surfaces Schematics of a) typical glycan array setup for investigating
the
glycan-binding preferences of a protein of interest (POI); b) spherical
liposome-based 3D glycan array; Development of orthogonal attachment
chemistries means that sugars
can be grafted onto distinct areas of a given solid support using
a myriad of methods, including thiol–ene and tetrazine click
reactions, imine condensations, and nonspecific photolabeling strategies. Glycan arrays have aided in the discovery of many interactions
of glycans and binding proteins from viruses, One advantage of glycan arrays is the very small amount of
material
that is needed for screening (down to femtograms of glycan), and which
is printed onto slides with automated robots that can routinely print
spots with 100 μm diameters, The spacing and
orientation of glycans on a biological interface
such as the cell surface is critical for carbohydrate recognition,
in particular for multivalent binding. One interesting route to overcoming the enforced structural
presentation
of surface attachment, and to introduce equilibrium control over density
and orientation, is the modification of glycan array approaches to
incorporate fluid membranes, for example by using liposomes or lipid
bilayers. For example, by incorporating varying amounts of D-mannose-appended
glycolipids into a supported lipid bilayer, Guo and co-workers have
showed  By allowing for the free diffusion of glycans, these
membrane-based
systems can equilibrate with glycans clustered at the correct distances
and orientations for optimal multivalent binding. Separately, this
concept has also been demonstrated in supported lipid bilayers ( More recently, whole cells have been demonstrated as platforms
which may offer enhanced functionality compared to conventional glycan
arrays. This can be done in one of two ways. First, the surface expression
of glycans can be manipulated by harnessing the mammalian cell’s
own glycan synthetic machinery. While the density of glycan presentation
is more easily controlled
with the synthetic glycoconjugate scaffolds discussed here, it can
be hard to replicate the heterogeneity present in biological systems
without significant synthetic effort. By utilizing genetically engineered
and chemoenzymatically altered whole cell platforms, it is simple
to access controlled diversity in the glycans presented, although
the more granular details of binding constants or cooperativity for
individual interactions may not be possible to infer. A spectrum of
technologies is available, ranging between precisely defined systems
and fluid, whole-cell glycan arrays, and the ideal technology will
depend greatly on the application and desired information. A therapeutic application of multivalent
glycoconjugates that garners
considerable research effort is vaccine development. Glycans are generally
considered to be poorly immunogenic, failing to produce long lasting
protection, particularly in infants and the elderly. a) T-cell-independent
immune response with carbohydrates. b) T-cell-dependent
immune response using glycoconjugate. c) Semisynthetic antibacterial
vaccine developed by Gening and co-workers. A list of current FDA approved
glycoconjugate vaccines has been
compiled recently. Both semisynthetic
and fully synthetic vaccines consist of three
main components: a synthetic carbohydrate antigen, a linker and a
carrier. The Cuban vaccine, Quimi-Hib, against the pneumonia and meningitis
causing bacterium  The development of fully synthetic vaccines
also garners considerable
research effort, however no fully synthetic vaccines have been licensed. A further application of multivalent
glycoconjugates is toward
the synthesis of anticancer vaccines and immunotherapy, an area of
research that has been reviewed extensively in the past 15 years. Quimi-Hib has shown us that semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccines
are possible. A major bottleneck in the application of semisynthetic
and fully synthetic vaccines is the large-scale synthesis of the desired
glycans through increased manufacturing complexities and higher costs,
when compared to obtaining glycans through pathogen cultivation, Multivalent glycoconjugates
are being investigated for a variety
of other therapeutic and diagnostic applications, including for lectin
inhibition, a) Antiadhesive therapies against  The macromolecular nature
of multivalent glycoconjugates typically
excludes them being considered “drug-like”, e.g., considering
Lipinski’s rules. Given the rapid acceleration in antibiotic
resistance, Multivalent glycoconjugates have also been applied to the inhibition
of carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Deficiency in the β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase),
which
is the underlying cause of the glycosphingolipid lysosomal storage
disorder Gaucher disease, can be counterintuitively improved by the
application of multivalent inhibitors in a technique called chaperone
therapy. Influenza A
infection is dependent on the action of two carbohydrate-binding
proteins The multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands on a macromolecular
scaffold also presents opportunities for the design of antiadhesive
agents, which act to prevent the adhesion of bacteria to cellular
surfaces in the initial stages of infection. For example, uropathogenic  Biofilm formation in  Mimicking natural structures synthetically is an important step
in the development of new therapeutics. Mucin, a densely glycosylated
polypeptide, is the primary component of mucus and provides an important
barrier for cells against microbial infections and toxins. Kiessling  Interest in the use of glyconanoparticles as diagnostic tools has
also been garnering attention. Colorimetric and fluorometric approaches to detect disease
markers
are attractive from a point-of-care context on account of their rapid
throughput, and typically high-sensitivity. With these applications
in mind, tetraphenylethylene scaffolds have been decorated with multiple
copies of carbohydrates that bind to the bacterial toxins As discussed above within
the context of glycan arrays, there is
a move toward creating biologically engineered whole-cell systems
for the specific display of multivalent glycoconjugates for therapeutic
and diagnostic applications. Early work used chemoenzymatic glycocalyx
editing to produce cells with specific glycosylation patterns, for
example using fucosyltransferase to install E-selectin ligands onto
the cell surface to enhance engraftment and trafficking of stromal
cells The progress made in complex glycan synthesis
and characterization
over the past 20 years has brought about a “golden age”
for glycobiology. Automated synthesis, chemoenzymatic methods, and
the huge diversity in scaffolds available means chemists can synthesize
multivalent carbohydrates which more and more closely approximate
the complexity and diversity seen in nature. This is complemented
by the tools that have been developed for the characterization of
complex systems, including mass spectrometry and chromatography techniques,
as well as a host of chemical biology and bioinformatics techniques
which can more accurately predict the natural systems we are seeking
to emulate. With these tools and techniques to hand, there remains
many challenges and opportunities for synthetic chemists to expand
our understanding of glycobiology. Heteromultivalent systems
present an area which deserves increased
attention, both for our fundamental understanding of interactions
with the glycocalyx in nature, and for the benefit of therapeutic
and diagnostic design. There is evidence to suggest that secondary
binding effects could have different entropic and enthalpic contributions
than their corresponding homomultivalent systems, The fluid, three-dimensional presentation of
a glycan within a
dynamic surface is a factor deserving increased consideration in the
design of multivalent systems. Multivalent interactions occur over
large surface areas, and the glycocalyx is thought to regulate membrane
shape by exerting forces that bend the plasma membrane in high-density
regions, Finally,
multivalency produces opportunity for aggregates as proteins
and multivalent glycans interact with one another through networks.
There is evidence that multivalent ligands and receptors can aggregate
and become kinetically trapped as a result of a phase transition. The ability to synthesize
mimics of the multivalent glycoconjugates
we see in nature affords the potential to understand their behavior
on a fundamental level. Further to these examples, there will be a
plethora of new biological questions, as well as applications in diagnostics
and therapeutics, which are fertile ground for synthetic chemists
who can increasingly make systems that reproduce the complexity and
diversity seen in nature.",[],2024-09-28,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"""std"""
11467826,Comparison of urine protein–creatinine ratio and urine dipstick test for significant proteinuria in preeclamptic women,"Assessing for significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP) stands as a key indicator for diagnosing preeclampsia. However, the initial method typically employed for this assessment, the urine dipstick test, often yields inaccurate results. While a 24-h urine collection is considered the most reliable test, its implementation can lead to delays in diagnosis, potentially affecting both maternal and fetal well-being. The urine protein–creatinine (P/Cr) ratio can be used as an alternative to 24-h urine protein analysis, but its diagnostic accuracy has remained uncertain. There is a need to compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine P/Cr ratio and dipstick urinalysis for SPIP, especially in resource-poor settings. To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine P/Cr ratio and dipstick urinalysis in a spot urine specimen for the diagnosis of SPIP among women evaluated for preeclampsia using 24-h urine protein excretions as a gold standard. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The study involved 82 singleton pregnant women evaluated for preeclampsia from 20 weeks of gestation who underwent dipstick and P/Cr ratio tests in the same urine sample. Women at risk of preeclampsia were given a specimen container for the collection of urine samples on an outpatient basis. Participants were trained and told to collect the urine sample 24 h prior to their next antenatal appointment. However, those on admission and evaluated for preeclampsia had their 24-h urine collected in the hospital. The outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio and accuracy for the two tests. Significant proteinuria was defined as a P/Cr ratio >0.27 or ⩾2+ of proteinuria on the dipstick test. Preeclampsia was confirmed in women with both high blood pressure and SPIP. The mean age of participants was 28.65 ± 5.76 years. Comparatively, the diagnostic accuracy (91.46% (95% CI = 83.29–96.59) vs 59.76% (95% CI = 48.34–70.44),  The spot urine P/Cr has superior diagnostic accuracy in the determination of significant proteinuria in pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia than the widely used dipstick test. A more robust multicenter study is needed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of spot urine PCR with the standard 24-h urine protein in low-income settings. 
Comparison of diagnostic tests for the detection of protein in the urine of pregnant women with preeclampsia
 • Preclampsia is one of the medical disorders that can complicate pregnancy, and it is a major cause of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. • Preeclampsia is the development of elevated blood pressure beyond the normal value during the second half of pregnancy with a significant amount of protein in the urine. • The detection of a significant amount of protein in the urine is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia; however, there are limitations with the various methods of urine protein detection and estimation. • The study was conducted among women being evaluated for preeclampsia. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of the urine protein-creatinine ratio and dipstick urine test for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria in pregnancy using 24-hour urine protein excretions as a gold standard. • Our findings showed that the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio has superior diagnostic accuracy when compared to the regular dipstick urine tests for the detection of significant protein in the urine among pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia.","The examination of urine for the presence of protein constitutes an important part of detecting people with preeclampsia. Traditionally, significant proteinuria (0.3 g/24 h) has been diagnosed through the collection of a 24-h urine sample, and this remains the widely recognized gold standard for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria. Due to the above shortfalls in 24-h urine collection, other methods are being proposed, which include the use of a urine dipstick, urine collection over shorter periods (2, 4, 8 or 12 h) and urine protein–creatinine (P/Cr) ratio. The dipstick is cheap, does not require much technical input and gives an instant result; however, studies show that it has low sensitivity and specificity when compared with the gold standard test. The protein–creatinine (Pr/Cr) ratio is superior to 24-h urine protein measurement, as stated by the UK Chronic Kidney Disease guideline. Medical disorders in pregnancy associated with significant proteinuria may increase adverse outcomes for the pregnant woman and her baby; therefore, the importance of an accurate assessment of SPIP cannot be overemphasized. Significant proteinuria in pregnancy may be seen in conditions such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension and renal disease. Preeclampsia remains a significant cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A lack of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) specific to glomerular foot processes (podocytes) is linked to kidney impairment in preeclampsia. fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), a soluble VEGF receptor, is expressed at higher levels in hypoxic placentas in patients with preclampsia (PE). In the end, sFlt-1 disrupts the filtration barrier and causes proteinuria by preventing VEGF from attaching to its receptor on endothelial cells and podocytes, leading to damage to the podocytes and glomeruloendotheliosis. Most of the previous studies on this have used only subjects in Western or Asian countries. There is a paucity of studies in our environment on the comparison of the P/Cr ratio and the urine dipstick test for significant proteinuria in preeclamptic women. Therefore, this research is undertaken to determine and compare the P/Cr ratio and dipstick test in a spot urine sample for accuracy in detecting the presence of SPIP against 24-h urine protein estimation for the diagnosis of preeclampsia. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The reporting of this study conforms to the Standard for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement. This study was conducted at the obstetrics and gynaecology unit of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) in Nnewi, Nigeria, between March and September 2020. The study participants were pregnant women at risk and evaluated for preeclampsia that presented to the antenatal clinic and labour ward unit of NAUTH, Nnewi, Nigeria. Those included in the study were all pregnant women with raised blood pressure diagnosed from 20 weeks of the index pregnancy, pregnant women with ⩾1+ of proteinuria on routine urinalysis from 20 weeks gestational age and pregnant or intrapartum women with a history of convulsion. The exclusion criteria were as follows: women diagnosed with hypertension and/or renal disease before pregnancy; pregnancy less than 20 weeks of gestation; pregnant women with a history of recurrent infection of the urinary tract; participants with concurrent clinical and laboratory evidence (bacteriuria) of urinary tract infection, molar pregnancy, or multiple pregnancies; and women who delivered before the completion of 24-h urine collection. The minimum sample size required for the study was calculated using Fisher’s formula. Documented, informed consent was obtained from all participating women. Women at risk of preeclampsia were given a specimen container for the collection of urine samples on an outpatient basis. They were told to collect the urine sample 24 h prior to their antenatal visit. However, those admitted to the hospital and evaluated for preeclampsia had their 24-h urine collection done on an inpatient basis. A container tagged with the patient’s full name and identification number was used to collect the specimen. Thorough washing of the hands with soap and water was done, and the hands were dried with a paper towel. The cap of the specimen container was removed, and care was taken to avoid touching the inside of the cap or the inside of the container. The cap was then placed on the table with the inside of the cap facing up. A sterile wipe was opened, and the patient was taught (by a female research assistant) to separate the labial folds covering the urinary opening with fingers and clean inside using one sterile wipe, moving from the front to the back. One side was cleaned and discarded, and then, with a new sterile wipe, the centre was cleaned and also discarded. The other side was finally cleaned with a new sterile wipe. The participant urinated into the toilet while still parting the urinary opening. The specimen container was introduced into the urine stream until it was half-filled with a mid-stream specimen. The cap was placed back on the container without touching the inside of the cap or the inside of the container. Every drop of urine during the 24-h period was collected, and it was started in the morning after emptying the bladder upon waking up from sleep. The time of starting was recorded. Urine was collected into the sample container and stored at room temperature. Urine was also collected at the time of defecation; care was taken to avoid fecal contamination. It was concluded the next morning after collecting the first urine. A midstream specimen of urine was provided by the participant in a 10-ml sterile container. The test was conducted immediately by dipping the strip into the urine sample, ensuring that the coloured reagent part was completely immersed in urine. The test strip was placed flat on a paper towel and read after 60 s by holding the strip against the container to compare the standardized chart with the sample strip. The result was recorded, and the strip was discarded. The dipstick test was performed by the researcher at any time of the day that the participant was seen, using N-Multistix SG-L, manufactured by Siemens Health Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. This Multistix container was colour-coded such that 1+ protein = 30 mg per 100 ml and 2+ protein = 100 mg per 100 ml. The research assistants were blinded to the clinical status of the participants. The estimation of protein and creatinine content in the urine sample was done using the colorimetric method. The sample was run as soon as it was collected. Boric acid was added as a preservative. In situations where the test cannot be done within 2 h after voiding, the sample is refrigerated immediately and then allowed to return to room temperature before the test is performed. Microbial multiplication in unpreserved urine at room temperature may lead to protein loss. Samples were stored at 0–8°C for a week or at 20°C for a month without significant effect on test results. Proteinuria was measured by the quantitative method Creatinine was measured by the quantitative method The protein concentration was divided by the creatinine concentration in mg per 100 ml. Significant proteinuria is a protein concentration greater than or equal to 300 mg in a 24-h urine specimen, greater than or equal to 2++ on a dipstick in a random mid-stream urine sample or a P/Cr (mg/mg) threshold of >0.27. Hypertension was defined as the presence of systolic blood pressure ⩾140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ⩾90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 h apart. Women who have hypertension and SPIP occurring after 20 weeks of gestation are classified as having preeclampsia. The outcome measures were the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio, and accuracy of the urine dipstick method and spot urine P/Cr in the diagnosis of SPIP in women evaluated for preeclampsia. The data were checked for completeness and tabulated. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were presented in tables and charts, while continuous data were presented in mean and standard deviation. As shown in previous studies, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios and accuracy for the P/Cr ratio versus dipstick test were calculated. The study was done over 7 months from March 2020 to September 2020. In all, 97 pregnant women with new-onset elevated blood pressure diagnosed in the second half of the index pregnancy were assessed for eligibility. Eleven of the subjects were excluded. Seven out of the 11 had chronic hypertension, while the remaining four developed hypertension before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Out of the 86 women who were recruited into the study, 82 (95.3%) women completed the study and were analysed, while four women delivered before the completion of 24-h urine collection and were further excluded. The flow chart for this study is shown in  Flow chart of the study. Participants’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

SPIP, significant proteinuria in pregnancy. The motivation for this study was that accurate examination of urine for the presence of protein constitutes a very important aspect of care to detect people with preeclampsia and its complications. Prompt and accurate diagnosis may contribute significantly to reducing the adverse effects of this condition in pregnancy. The principal finding of the present study was that the spot P/Cr ratio has higher diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio than the dipstick test. However, the negative likelihood ratio for the dipstick test was expectedly higher than the spot P/Cr ratio. The spot P/Cr ratio showed a better correlation with 24-h urine protein measurement than the dipstick test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of accuracy and sensitivities for the dipstick urinalysis. Ebeigbe et al. The present study also showed that the spot P/Cr ratio had a higher sensitivity and specificity value when compared to the dipstick test. These results are comparable to those reported by Ebeigbe et al., who showed a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 88.5% for the spot P/Cr ratio. Ebeigbe et al. The present study also demonstrated that there was no relationship between the spot P/Cr ratio and the dipstick test. This could be the result of some mechanisms. For instance, the production of creatinine is constant for every individual, and it depends on the muscle mass of that individual, unlike the excretion of protein in the urine, which depends on the degree of endothelial damage to the kidneys. However, in a prospective observational study done by Baba et al., Contrary to predictive test values, likelihood ratios are less subject to variations in the presence of a disease in a given population. A likelihood ratio greater than 1 indicates that the test result is associated with the presence of the disease, whereas a likelihood ratio less than 1 indicates that the test result is associated with the absence of the disease. The further likelihood ratios are from 1, the stronger the evidence for the presence or absence of the disease. Likelihood ratios above 10 and below 0.1 are considered to provide strong evidence to rule in or rule out diagnosis, respectively, in most circumstances. In this study, the sub-group analysis of women at pre-term gestation compared to term gestation showed that the majority of the participants had preterm delivery. This shows that a greater burden of the disease, in terms of fetal morbidity and mortality, results from complications of preterm birth. The clinical implications of the findings could be very fascinating; for instance, the dipstick test could be described as cheap, easy to perform, does not require technical expertise and gives an instant result. On the other hand, P/Cr ratio tests are more expensive and require technical expertise and trained laboratory personnel when compared to dipstick urinalysis. The P/Cr ratio test result could be available within 30 min (though longer than the dipstick test time), but it is still timely to make a definitive diagnosis and institute appropriate treatment. Though the P/Cr ratio test may be more expensive, its benefits in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy far outweigh the drawback of cost because the consequences of misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions are far-reaching. The strength of this study lies in the fact that our study provided updated information on the accuracy of the spot P/Cr ratio test compared to the urine dipstick test for evaluating significant proteinuria. However, the limitation of the study was that we could not determine the accuracy of the test with respect to the severity of preeclampsia. Also, the study is a single-centre study; hence, it is difficult to generalize our findings; hence, a multicentre, large sample size study is necessary to strengthen or refute our findings. In future studies, factors such as differences in the detection thresholds, variability in test conditions or patient heterogeneity should be evaluated to determine its significant contribution in the interpretation of findings. In this study, the spot P/Cr ratio, a hospital-based test, has superior sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the determination of significant proteinuria in pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia than the widely used protein dipstick tests. There was no correlation between the protein dipstick test and the spot P/Cr ratio test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy. While the dipstick test may at best be used as a screening tool because of the cost/convenience, there may be a need for universal adoption of the spot P/Cr ratio test for the confirmation of significant proteinuria in pregnancy in women evaluated for preeclampsia in this setting.","['hypertension', 'preeclampsia', 'protein/creatinine ratio', 'proteinuria', 'significant proteinuria in pregnancy']",2024-10-9,Therapeutic Advances in Reproductive Health,"""std"""
11467576,Diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases in canines based on images using neural networks for image segmentation,"The primary challenge in diagnosing ocular diseases in canines based on images lies in developing an accurate and reliable machine learning method capable of effectively segmenting and diagnosing these conditions through image analysis. Addressing this challenge, the study focuses on developing and rigorously evaluating a machine learning model for diagnosing ocular diseases in canines, employing the U-Net neural network architecture as a foundational element of this investigation. Through this extensive evaluation, the authors identified a model that exhibited good reliability, achieving prediction scores with an Intersection over Union (IoU) exceeding 80 %, as measured by the Jaccard index. The research methodology encompassed a systematic exploration of various neural network backbones (VGG, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet) and the U-Net model, combined with an extensive model selection process and an in-depth analysis of a custom training dataset consisting of historical images of different medical symptoms and diseases in dog eyes. The results indicate a fairly high degree of accuracy in the segmentation and diagnosis of ocular diseases in canines, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. In conclusion, this potentially makes a significant contribution to the field by utilizing advanced machine-learning techniques to develop image-based diagnostic routines in veterinary ophthalmology. This model's successful development and validation offer a promising new tool for veterinarians and pet owners, enhancing early disease detection and improving health outcomes for canine patients.","The purpose of this research was to explore the possibility of developing efficient software models that will be able to provide fast screening for eye abnormalities in canines solely by examining an image taken by a smartphone or single camera under various conditions. Using the developed model, pet owners may have a unique opportunity to detect early development of eye diseases in their pets and seek timely veterinary help. Furthermore, such tools may also provide rapid screening capabilities for veterinarians allowing them to quickly initiate medical treatment or facilitate a referral to the veterinary ophthalmologist, dramatically improving the quality of the veterinary care for patients with eye diseases. To develop the precise and reliable diagnostic success of software tools, it is crucial to construct a precise and robust model based on expert knowledge [ Symbolic representation and general anatomic localization of clinical symptoms - corneal edema (a), episcleral congestion (b), epiphora (c), and Cherry Eye disease (d). Corneal edema  As already mentioned, all the above clinical symptoms and diseases can be early clinical signs of vision-threatening ocular diseases, and their early detection and recognition may provide a unique opportunity for timely veterinary intervention and prevention of more serious complications. The main contributions and novelties of this manuscript are the following. A novel dataset of eye clinical symptoms and diseases with images containing close-ups of ocular structures, annotated and prepared for supervised machine learning. Extension of U-Net architecture for image segmentation composed with the backbone of deep convolutional neural networks VGG16, ResNet34, Inception V3, and EfficientNet B3 with extensive performance comparison. Influence analysis of the selected loss functions (Categorical cross-entropy loss, Dice loss, and Focal loss) in the U-Net segmentation architecture for the canine eye symptoms segmentation. A novel U-Net model with Res-Net34 backbone for pixel-based automatic localization of clinical symptoms and recognition of eye diseases in dogs with detailed statistical analysis. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: A summary of the research about the popular machine learning techniques used in medical-related imagery for humans and pets closely related to ophthalmology is provided in Section  The field of ophthalmology has increasingly integrated the advances of computer vision over the past decade, leveraging its capabilities to enhance the classification and diagnosis of eye diseases [ Despite the broad application of these technologies in human ophthalmology, the exploration into canine ocular diseases has been relatively limited [ The first convolution networks were used for classification tasks only [ Object detection (a) vs. image (instance) segmentation (b). For our modeling, we first needed to detect the eye to localize the area of interest in the image, and then segment the eye image so that we can more precisely mark the area of the eye that is affected by a disease. For this reason, we chose artificial neural networks that are typically used to classify images, localize objects, and extract features from images, such as edges or corners, namely convolutional networks. These networks use convolution operations to process the input data allowing them to handle large amounts of image data and video. We also chose to research the methods that showed the best results on segmentation tasks on benchmark data sets, so in the research, we decided to investigate the possibility of applying and adapting the U-Net architecture and its variants in our tasks. Given that there is no available data that could be used to train models for automatic canine eye disease detection, we had to build a dataset that includes segmentation of eye regions with clinical symptoms and classification into the appropriate class. To build and annotate the database, we used original images and expert knowledge from a board of certified veterinary ophthalmologists. It is known that the training of most neural networks will be more successful if many thousands of labeled training samples are used, which is difficult to ensure when creating a customized database for special purposes such as our case. However, experiences and trends have shown that deep neural networks, including U-Net, can be successfully trained with much fewer images, using methods of knowledge transfer and data augmentation [ To be able to learn a machine learning model for the detection and segmentation of the eye area, as well as for all tasks of supervised machine learning, it is necessary to have an appropriate data set prepared in such a way that the model can be trained on it and a set on which the model will be evaluated and tested. When defining an appropriate data set, it is necessary to collect appropriate images, preprocess them, and prepare them for the appropriate machine-learning tasks for which the model will be trained. In the field of medical and veterinary image analysis, we used expert annotations to associate a diagnosis label to images for the task of image classification and recognition of eye disease diagnoses, then labeling with a bounding box the object (eye) in the image and associating the corresponding label that includes the corresponding diagnosis and coloring the eye region for image segmentation. Careful selection of the learning set, i.e. a quality data set, is key to developing a model that aims to help define diagnoses with relevant and useable suggestions. Many publicly available datasets are designed specifically for a certain purpose, but none involve the detection or segmentation of the eye, especially not the eye of a dog or cat, nor the detection of disease states. The size of benchmark datasets varies from a couple of MB to a few TB and can be applied in classification, object detection, semantics, and instance segmentation. The Pascal VOC dataset [ The MS COCO dataset [ The open Images dataset [ The ImageNet dataset [ We built our original custom dataset DogEyeSeg4: Dog Eye Segmentation 4-Class Ophthalmological Disease [ Some of the images were taken from the Atlas of Veterinary Eye Diseases [ For each image, a corresponding single-channel mask of the same dimensions as the original image is created that includes segmented image regions corresponding to a particular medical symptom or eye disease. There are 4 classes plus the background in the set, which are displayed in such a way that different pixel intensities represent different classes as shown in  The input image examples, column (c1), with the corresponding masks column (c2). The masks are colored to better distinguish between classes. The dataset exhibits a well-balanced distribution among the different classes, as can be observed in  Distribution of Data Classes in the Dataset. The number represents the recurrence of certain diseases in images. To enhance the robustness and effectiveness of our model, we implemented data augmentation techniques. Drawing from the insights of previous research in the domain of medical imaging, particularly referencing the U-Net approach [ In a separate context, those exploring polyp segmentation [ Affine augmentations: Original image (a), horizontal flip (b), horizontal shift (c), rotation (d), and vertical shift (e). The bottom line of our augmentation methodology lies in its ability to diversify the dataset, making it more representative of different viewing angles during image capture, all the while preserving the integrity of the underlying symptoms. This approach aligns with a scientific and rigorous manner of data manipulation, ensuring that the augmentations serve as a surrogate for changes in camera position, without altering the essential clinical characteristics of the eye conditions under study. Transfer learning is a widely used technique in computer vision that allows the use of patterns previously learned on other problems and data sets with little tweaking, on another data set to learn models of interest instead of starting the learning process from scratch. Namely, CNNs in their layers can learn different features on images, e.g.: initial network layers learn low-level features such as lines, points, curves, and the like, layers in the middle of the network learn objects built on top of low-level features while high-level layers can include high-level features based on the features of previous layers. Of course, the more similar the data sets are, the better results can be expected. It has been shown transfer learning achieves as good results as learning from scratch but with significantly less time and computer resources [ Also, thanks to transfer learning more complicated CNN architectures can solve more complex computer vision tasks, so we can build an architecture e.g. object detection or image segmentation on top of another CNN that was originally trained for image classification, we just need to discard the fully connected layers that are intended for classification. In this case, we use CNN as a feature extractor, which is a key part of the model for object detection and segmentation. The networks that are used to extract features in more complicated models and that process the input data into a representation of a particular feature are called the backbone. Many popular CNN architectures can be used as backbone networks, and we have included in our research: VGG (Visual Geometry Group Very Deep Convolutional Network) [ Those networks that we used to extract features work well as stand-alone networks on simpler classification tasks, and we have used their already pre-trained models on large data sets such as the ImageNet dataset [ The pre-trained models, initially developed on the extensive and varied datasets serve as a strong foundation for their adaptability to specific tasks on the custom ophthalmology dataset. This custom dataset is carefully constructed to be used in eye disease detection; tailoring domain-specific features built on the rich knowledge gained from ImageNet. Through a process of fine-tuning, these models were trained to provide the best possible results in the specific area of ophthalmic image segmentation for our research. This fine-tuning involved adjusting model parameters and training strategies to match the unique characteristics and challenges presented by ophthalmic images. As a result, the models are finely calibrated to detect and diagnose eye diseases with high accuracy. To incorporate pre-trained model weights into U-Net architecture it was essential to prepare images to an expected input of the desired model. The desired model is applied to a coder part of the U-Net structure and feature maps are concatenated in the same manner as when the U-Net base model is applied to a decoder segment. This way U-Net becomes the structure that is held by a CNN backbone of one's choice. Further, different backbones used in these experiments will be described along with the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The fully convolutional neural network VGG, which was proposed in 2015, was designed to reduce the number of parameters in the convolution layers and thus reduce the training time. Compared to AlexNet [ The architecture of a VGG-16 deep convolutional neural network. With each layer in CNN, the complexity of model functions increases. The weights of CNN, such as VGG are computed through the backpropagation. Due to backpropagation the gradient loss closely related to the weights is calculated in each layer and reverted through the network. With each multiplication or convolution of small weights, the gradients get considerably smaller in earlier layers, which can result in a significant increase in the training time. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem and considerably affects the performance of CNN [ The architecture of the ResNet18 deep convolutional neural network. In certain cases, objects in focus appear in different sizes and this is proven to be difficult to detect, especially if the dataset doesn't consist of different scale object presentations [ The architecture of Inception V3 deep convolutional neural network. The last CNN used in this research, called EfficientNet, tries to efficiently use the knowledge gathered from the previously introduced CNN-s. The architecture of the net is carefully designed to give better results with fewer parameters. As an example, EfficientNet B1 is 7.6x smaller and 5.7x faster than ResNet152 [ The architecture of EfficientNet B0 deep convolutional neural network. The pre-trained model depends on the usability of the dataset used for training. U-Net is an image segmentation architecture that was developed primarily for medical image analysis [ The encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that downsamples the input image and extracts features at different levels of abstraction. It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers. The base U-Net [ The bridge connects the encoder and decoder. It combines the features from the deepest layer of the encoder with the features from the shallowest layer of the decoder. By doing so it allows the network to propagate contextual information from the encoder to the decoder. This is essential for accurate segmentation. The decoder is also a CNN, but it up-samples the feature maps from the encoder and combines them with features from the encoder at different levels of abstraction. The decoder consists of a series of up sampling and convolutional layers. As before the base U-Net CNN has a 2x2 transpose convolution layer in each up-sampling layer and a kernel size of 3x3 which uses the ReLU activation function. The decoder up-samples the feature maps from the encoder by a factor of 2 at each stage. This means that the final output of the decoder has the same spatial resolution as the input image. The following algorithm diagram  Algorithm explaining the process of getting predicted segmentation masks from training images with corresponding masks describing ground truth. Once the model is trained, it can be used to segment new images by predicting the probability of each pixel belonging to each class. The class with the highest probability is then assigned to each pixel. A visual representation of the algorithm can be seen in  Basic U-Net architecture. The arrows represent convolution, ReLu, max-pooling, and crop-concatenation. Blue boxes feature maps at each layer and gray cropped feature maps from the contracting path. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) The upgraded U-Net model utilized in this study combines the strengths of different backbones, employing a feature extraction at various abstraction levels, like the structure depicted in  Improved base U-Net model with backbone where each encoder block downscales input image and extract features which are then combined with decoder blocks up-sampled feature maps at different levels of abstraction. The purpose of the activation function in CNN-s is to calculate and convert the weighted sum of the neuron to a non-linear output. The most used activation functions and the ones used in the scope of this research are ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit) [ Activation functions from left to right: ReLu (a), Sigmoid (b), SoftMax (c). ReLu is often used in hidden layers of CNN.  It avoids vanishing gradient, and it is simpler than sigmoid activation functions and therefore it requires less computation resources. Its main disadvantage is shown to be for the activations in the part of the domain less than 0 causing dead neurons. Some derivatives avoid such behavior, such as Leaky and Parametric ReLu but cause other problems [ The sigmoid activation function has an output from 0 to 1 and because it is not zero-centered it raises the problem of vanishing gradient which results in great computation time consumption.  Its main advantages are simplicity and applicability to be used as a classifier. In image segmentation, it is widely used for binary classification. For the multiple classification SoftMax activation function is used rather than Sigmoid. SoftMax as shown in  When activation functions are applied for multiple classifications, SoftMax's probabilities sum to a value of 1 which is not the case with a Sigmoid's probabilities. Sigmoid's class probabilities are independent of one another because Sigmoid treats each neural node output value separately. In SoftMax, where probabilities depend on each other, one probability value will decrease in favor of a more probable class. SoftMax for this reason is easier to implement as it gives a vector as an output from which a class can be easily extracted using Argmax. The evaluation metric is used to measure the quality of the trained model to determine its usefulness. There are many different evaluation metrics available to assess a model. Choosing the right one has a great impact on the training and testing and therefore on acceptance of the same. To justly compare models, the same metric must be used. Some metrics are more applicable to image classification than to image segmentation and vice versa. Precision is one of those. It is the simplest and most effective metric but due to class imbalance, it is shown to be extremely inefficient. The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) are the most used in region detection metrics. In image segmentation the IoU, as the name suggests, takes two regions of interest, and measures the similarity between them by dividing the region which overlaps with a region of both regions united. If there are no intersecting pixels the IoU value will be zero but if there are some the IoU score will rise to the value of 1 in case regions overlap one another entirely. The IoU metric is simple and easy to implement once the regions are classified as shown in  Implementation of Jaccard index (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) using a confusion matrix. The way IoU and DSC are calculated is very similar where their score is always within a factor of 2 as seen in  They are also always positively correlated, meaning that if one of classifiers is better under one metric it will also be better using another metric as well. The difference between metrics is visible when the average score over a set of inferences is taken. This can be observed by quantifying how much worse one classifier is over another. IoU leans towards punishing bad classifiers’ single instances more than DSC does. Consequently, DSC leans toward measuring a bad classifier closer to average whereas the IoU tends to measure the score of a bad classifier closer to the extreme. This can have an impact on the final decision like in an example where most of the inferences are slightly better by one classifier and just a small number are drastically worse by the same classifier. In that case, those two metrics may differ in judgment on which classifier to prefer. In this research average scores of both metrics were used to prevent misclassification. Loss functions are mathematical formulations that analyze deviations of the predictions and the ground truth values. A greater loss value indicates the model is more prone to errors whereas a lesser loss suggests the model's predictions are more accurate. The main objective of loss function application is loss reduction. The way this is achieved is by affecting trainable parameters, for instance, biases and weights. There are many loss functions available today and each of them has its ways of rewarding and penalizing the model's accuracy and errors respectively. Some are more applicable to the model on which this research is focused than others, which is why it is important to choose the one that will provide the best results. One of the loss functions used in this research is the Dice loss (DL) function. It is based on the DSC metric, which essentially measures the overlap between two sample areas of an image. The mathematical  DL comes in a range from 0 to 1, where DL leaning towards 1 indicates bad classifier and DL leaning towards 0, which is the desirable outcome, points to a perfect classifier. DSC can be expressed using precision telling how accurate positive predictions are and recall which describes coverage of actual positive samples. Both precision and recall in a good classifier will lean towards 1. The mathematical presentation of precision and recall, as seen in  F1-score is a harmonic means of precision and recall. The harmonic mean will always give the lowest value of precision and recall and by doing so it will penalize the lowest score. By maximizing F1-score both precision and recall will raise in value while staying balanced. To transform the discrete function of DL to calculate probabilities in the range from 0 to 1,  Cross entropy (CE) loss function is another loss function used in this research and it's widely acceptable in the scientific community for its simplicity and positive training results. It measures the difference between two probability distributions rather than overlaying between areas like DL for a specified arbitrary set of events. When used in statistics, entropy refers to the measurement of disorder providing info about the number of ways a system can be arranged. A higher entropy value means higher disorder. CE stands for the sum of all entropies of all the probability predictions. The CE is also known as a Binary CE (BCE) since it's used in the classification of only two classes.  A Categorical CE (CCE) that consists of multiple BCEs is used in multi-class cases, and the  CE loss is focused on minimizing pixel-related error, but in class-imbalanced cases, this leads to over concertation on larger objects, which as a result, lowers the segmentation performance of smaller objects. To improve performance on hard-to-detect objects CCE can be extended to Focal loss function (FL). FL concentrates more on the objects that are wrongly predicted than on the objects that were correctly predicted with high confidence by making sure that predictions on hard examples get better in time. This is achieved by downweighing as described by authors in Ref. [ The BCE can be presented in  For building models, along the U-Net base model, U-Net with four different backbones was used. ResNet34; Inception V3; VGG16; EfficientNet B3. Selection was based on popularity and benefits explained in the previous section along with publicly available pre-trained weights for quicker and better convergence. Particular versions of each backbone were hand-picked after initial experiments considering the speed-accuracy ratio. A learning rate of 0.0001 with a fixed batch size of 16 images, optimized with Adam optimizer for 100 Epoch was used across all models. Four different loss functions were used. Categorical cross-entropy loss – CCE, Dice loss – DL, Focal loss – FL, Balanced Dice and Focal loss function - DL + FL. The training was done using the original dataset in combination with augmented images. The dataset was divided between test and training in a ratio of 1:9 by random selection of images. All models were developed in Python with libraries compatible with Keras and TensorFlow frameworks. The training part was performed on the Windows platform using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 12 GB RAM and the testing part was made using Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1603 v4 @ 2.80 GHz. Models were trained in sequence on the same hardware using the same datasets to maintain the fairness of evaluation. During training, loss, and IoU values were observed. Metrics used to evaluate the performance of models are IoU and F-score equally distributed with a threshold of 50 %. The models with the highest score during each of the 100 epochs were chosen and preserved for further evaluation. The progress of training loss is shown in  The example of average training loss (a) and IOU (b) values for 100 epochs. Trained models can be divided into U-Net base model and 4 groups where each group is trained using based U-Net and with a different backbone. Each group can be subdivided into 4 different models based on loss function as can be seen in  Segmentation  Average test time is computed as approximation of time needed for the segmentation of 20 images on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1603 v4 @ 2.80 GHz. Average train time is time needed for training on full dataset using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 12 GB RAM. The results clearly show that the use of a more complex model that includes U-Net and backbone models was a very good strategy that contributed in most cases to a significant improvement in segmentation and classification results. Regardless of which type of backbone network is used and which loss function is used in model training, significantly better results than the original U-net network were achieved for all classes except for the Cherry eye class. This can be related to the insufficient data for that class which was not sufficient to adjust the EfficientNet network parameter, and the overly simple VGG backbone network which failed to extract relevant and discriminative features for Cherry eye. The U-Net + ResNet34 model using DL + FL loss has the overall highest score for two out of 4 classes according to the Jaccard coefficient measure. When exclusively employing the Dice loss within the U-Net + ResNet34 model, performance, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, demonstrates a significant improvement of the Epiphora class compared to other models. U-Net + Inception V3 has the best score for the Corneal Edema class with a Jaccard index of 78.3 %. The difference between the best and worst performing models in cases where the background class is disregarded is 27 %. Both are from the model with the same backbone. This is also an example of the highest improvement using different loss functions. If the least detectable class is not considered – Epiphora class, the average score of all models improves up to over 13 %. The models based on U-Net + VGG16 are shown to be the quickest in the segmentation of test images. Further experiments were performed on all models using DL + FL functions which gave the best results according to  Cross-validation using dataset folds in a ratio of 80:20. Notably, in this part of the experiment, the background was considered as first class. This consideration of the background class significantly contributes to the overall improvement in model performance, as background segmentation accuracy is usually particularly high. The results of the cross-validation are shown in  Results of a 5-fold cross-validation with a Jaccard index coefficient in percentage as a reference with background class included. Since we could not compare the models trained on our image database for segmentation and classification of eye diseases with the reference results because they simply do not exist, we analyzed the results with statistical tests ANOVA [ Prior to further statistical analyses we conducted a QQ-Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot) for Standardized Residuals to assess the normality of the data distribution since the normal distribution of residuals is a common assumption in ANOVA [ The QQ-Plot visually compares the distribution of standardized residuals from our data to a theoretically normal distribution. Ideally, for the residuals to be considered normally distributed, the plot's points should align closely with the 45-degree reference line. In our analysis, the points from the QQ-Plot demonstrated a satisfactory alignment with this line, indicating that the assumptions of normality are reasonably met. The QQ-plot following our research is shown in  Shows a QQ-plot, comparing the standardized residuals of a model to a theoretical normal distribution. The data aligns with the expected normal line, with minimal tailing observed, indicating a generally normal distribution of residuals. Based on the results obtained from the QQ-Plot analysis, which suggested that our data distribution adheres to the normality assumption, we proceeded with a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the impact of the proposed network architecture modifications on the segmentation results. ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more samples to understand if at least one sample mean is significantly different from the others due to a specific factor. In this case, we compare the means of the five samples where factor is the architecture modification, and the samples are the Jaccard index coefficient from each fold. The null hypothesis asserts that all group means are equivalent, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that at least one group differs significantly. To compute the p-value, we conducted the ANOVA test [ The next step, Between-Group Variance, involves calculating how much the group means deviates from the overall mean of all samples combined. This metric reflects the variance resulting from the differences in network architectures. After Between-Group Variance, Within-Group Variance is calculated. Here, the variability of individual group samples around their respective group means is assessed. This variance measures the characteristic variation in segmentation performance within the same network architecture across different folds. By dividing the between-group variance by the within-group variance the F-value is calculated. A higher F-value suggests a greater degree of difference among group means relative to the variation within groups. Finally, the p-value is derived from the F-distribution, based on the calculated F-value and the degrees of freedom associated with the between-group and within-group variances. The p-value indicates the probability of observing the calculated level of variation among group means if the null hypothesis were true. A p-value less than 0.05 is a widely accepted standard indicating that the observed data would be quite unlikely under the null hypothesis, suggesting a real effect or difference between the groups tested. In our case, the calculated p-value of 5.294·10 The Tukey HSD test is a widely endorsed method for this purpose, allowing for multiple pairwise comparisons while controlling for the family-wise error rate. This test is particularly useful in situations where multiple comparison tests are required, as it adjusts the p-values to account for the fact that the more tests you perform, the higher the chance of encountering a false positive. The outcome of the Tukey HSD test provides us with a means to rigorously compare each model against the others, returning pairwise significance levels and confidence intervals for the difference in means. These statistical tools guide us in determining which architectural enhancements to the U-Net model yield a statistically reliable improvement in segmentation performance. The analysis, again, was performed using the Jaccard Index as the primary metric for evaluating model performance ( Comparison of models using Jaccard Index based on different architectures with combination of Dice and Focal Loss using Tukey HSD test showing p-value for each pair combination. In this comparative analysis, we specifically focused on how modifications to the U-Net architecture influence its segmentation accuracy, with a use of Jaccard Index. The p-values reported by the Tukey HSD test, as shown in  The comparisons within the enhanced U-Net models reveal varying degrees of performance impact. The match between U-Net + ResNet34 against U-Net + Inception V3 with resulting p-value of 0.013 and U-Net + VGG16 with p-value of 0.001 shows significant performance differences, highlighting a robust performance distinction. However, the comparison between U-Net + ResNet34 and U-Net + EfficientNet B3 yields a p-value of 0.046, situating it at the border of statistical significance. This suggests a meaningful but less distinct contrast in their performance, indicating that while different, the performance improvements from ResNet34 and EfficientNet B3 are closer than with others. Worth mentioning, the comparison between U-Net + Inception V3 and U-Net + EfficientNet B3, with a p-value of 0.9, suggests no significant difference in their performance enhancements. This outcome implies that both architectural modifications offer comparable benefits. Additionally, the near-significant p-value of 0.09 for U-Net + Inception V3 versus U-Net + VGG16 indicates a slight but not statistically significant difference in performance, suggesting their potential equivalence in effectiveness. The results of statistical analysis indicate that the U-Net + ResNet34 models besides consistent well performance, significantly differ from other models based on the different architecture, therefore further experiments will include U-Net + ResNet34 model alone. U-Net + ResNet34 models showed the best segmentation and classification performances on our image database. In  5-fold cross-validation results of U-Net + ResNet34 models based on the Jaccard and Dice Index. The best results are marked in bold, and average in bold italic. In addition, Precision, Recall, and Pixel Accuracy were evaluated, which provides a comprehensive understanding of model performance, as shown in  Precision, Recall, and Pixel Accuracy evaluation of cross-validation models. The best results are marked in bold. Average results are written in bold italic. In  Confusion matrix of U-Net + ResNet34 Cross-Validation Model 2. A confusion matrix provides a practical way to compare a model's performance across different classes, especially when there's an imbalance in the number of pixels belonging to each class. The background has very high precision and it has less than 1 % FP in favor of Corneal Edema. Epiphora class has the best performance with only 3 % belonging to the Epiphora class but being classified wrongly as belonging to the Background. Other classes have fewer pixels classified correctly and are only confused with the background. Zeroes implies that the model does not confuse samples originally belonging to disease class with each other, i.e. the classification boundary between disease classes was learned well by the model. The Cherry Eye prediction outcomes should be the focus for enhancing this model's performance. The classifier misclassified 30 % of samples which is the highest misclassification rate of all the classes. This pattern suggests difficulties in differentiating Cherry Eye from the background, potentially due to texture and color similarities. It's important to note that the confusion matrix in  In  Segmentation of test images containing closeup of an eye with diagnosis. The left column (c1) shows original images, the middle column (c2) shows ground truth (GT) and the right column (c3) predictions. The upper row (r1) predicts two classes as ground truth, the middle row (r2) fails to detect Epiphora class, and the lower row (r3) falsely detects another instance of Episcleral congestion. Segmentation of test images containing whole head figure with diagnosis. The left column (c1) shows original images, the middle column (c2) ground truth (GT) and the right column (c3) predictions. The upper row (r1) predicts Cherry Eye positively and episcleral congestion falsely. The middle row (r2) makes a false detection of the corneal edema but correctly segments Cherry Eye. The lower row (r3) detects a combination of episcleral congestion and corneal edema classes where only the Cherry Eye class is present. From the resulting images of the test dataset, it is evident that the prediction model works within the scope of the expectation, providing the user with sufficient data to assist in the diagnosis of four eye conditions a pet can experience. The epiphora is the class which in general has proven to be the hardest to segment, even though U-Net + ResNet34 Cross-Validation Model 2, which was taken as an example shows otherwise, is also the most difficult to annotate due to not-so-distinguished boundaries. Considering the visual difference, when observed by the human eye, the classes that get most mixed between are the Cherry Eye and episcleral congestion. These are the ones developed models also find sometimes difficult to distinguish, especially when the observed object is small and distant. The problem that arises when the head figure or whole body is present in the image is related to false positives in regions that don't include the eye at all. Such a behavior can be prevented by focusing on an eye before starting a segmentation. The reason for the inclusion of these images in the dataset is the fact that dogs aren't always cooperative during the close-up eye image capturing. Further research could include handling mechanisms of obtaining closeup images by extracting regions with an eye and making an automatic selection of the best eye image in the image sequence. When comparing the results of models based on different backbones, datasets, and loss functions ResNet34 was demonstrated to be the optimal solution providing the best results in the majority of tests. Considering the time of test prediction execution, which is in close relation to complexity and resource requirements, in combination with other scores U-Net + ResNet34 was superior for the analysis of dataset from this study. Only base U-Net and U-Net + VGG16 have a faster response but at the considerable cost of a prediction score. Slightly better segmentation results of corneal edema have U-Net + Inception V3 which can be assumed is caused by better segmentation of images with a variable size of the cornea. The potential model improvement could be achieved by combining various backbones to keep practicality as the major priority. The background should be discarded in average scores. The decision to exclude the background class from average scores warrants further elaboration. In this image segmentation study, it became evident that including the background class in our evaluation metrics did not significantly contribute to the practical insights gained from the model. The primary reason for discarding the background class in our average scores is twofold. Firstly, background pixels typically dominate the majority of images in the dataset, resulting in a disproportionately large share of the evaluation. However, these background regions often do not contain meaningful information related to the specific eye conditions under investigation. As a result, their inclusion would unduly influence the overall segmentation scores without providing valuable insights into the model's ability to differentiate between the classes of interest. Secondly, the study focuses on the accurate identification and segmentation of specific eye conditions in canines, a task that necessitates precise recognition of pathological features within the images. In most cases, the background class does not offer relevant information for the diagnostic process. Therefore, considering the high values achieved in the absence of the background class, its inclusion would not only deceive the observer but also complicate the interpretation of the model's performance on the classes of actual clinical interest. In essence, the exclusion of the background class from our average scores aligns with the study's primary objective, which is to assess the model's performance in identifying and segmenting Corneal Edema, Episcleral Congestion, Epiphora, and Cherry Eye. By doing so, the aim is to provide a more focused and accurate evaluation of the model's practicality and effectiveness in the domain of veterinary ophthalmology. By removing the background class from our average scores, we ensure that evaluation metrics provide a clear and meaningful reflection of the model's ability to address the specific challenges presented by canine ocular diseases. This deliberate choice emphasizes commitment to a balanced and informative assessment of the model's diagnostic capabilities. The Jaccard and Dice Index are used as the main evaluation over other metrics such as Recall and Precision considering segmentation evaluation best practice [ The decision to use a combination of DL and FL gave better results than using FL, DL, or CCE alone. The choice to combine DL and FL, rather than employing each loss function individually, stemmed from the unique advantages they bring. Dice Loss, known for its ability to handle class imbalance effectively, excels in providing precise segmentation results. Focal Loss, on the other hand, prioritizes challenging examples during training, contributing to better convergence and performance in the presence of abundant easy examples. This combination effectively balanced the trade-off between high-precision segmentation and the ability to tackle complex cases. While the alternative strategy of combining FL and CCE was not specifically tested in this study, it can be reasonably assumed that the joined benefits of DL and FL would outperform using FL alone or in conjunction with CCE. This is due to the similarity in objectives between FL and CCE, with FL enhancing the concepts of CCE. The inclusion of an additional 25 % of augmented images in the dataset proved to be a successful strategy in this research. By doing so, the dataset was extended to an optimal number of images based on [ During the training process, it is apparent that all models were converging as expected by continued lowering of the loss and an increase of IoU. It can be speculated that further training could result in better performance, but it would require significant resources, which might not be justified. It would take significantly more training to achieve just a mild improvement. Since the goal of this study was to make the model widely applicable, further research will be oriented toward making it more practical and easily applicable on mobile devices. The final model should strive to be a tradeoff between accuracy and accessibility. Acknowledging the limitations and weaknesses of our study enriches its context and guides future research directions. The current dataset, though informative, could be enhanced by increasing its size and diversity with more classes, potentially improving model generalization. Incorporating attention mechanisms might also refine the results by focusing on relevant features. However, dataset expansion is challenging due to the extensive expert hours required for accurate annotation. Experimenting with a broader range of models and continuously enriching the dataset with more classes and images would likely enhance performance, despite the significant effort and time investment involved. Additionally, exploring advanced data analysis techniques could unveil deeper insights, further advancing the study's contributions. Our model, originally designed for a canine eye disease, was applied to a human eye segmentation dataset – Open Eye Dataset (OpenEDS) [ Notably, the absence of parallel research efforts specifically addressing canine eye segmentation highlights the innovative application of this model. The minor practical difference in mIoU relative to the challenge's top entry suggests the possible further model refinement, especially with a specific segmentation task in mind. Despite the model's origination for diagnosing canine eye diseases, its competitive performance in a human eye segmentation challenge illustrates its broader applicability and underscores the potential for cross-species diagnostic tools. While there is a limited supply of datasets and study dedicated to segmenting the human eyes for numerous reasons, corresponding datasets and studies focusing on canine subjects are virtually nonexistent. The scarcity of comparable studies, especially in the segmentation of canine ocular diseases, highlights the unique contribution of this research and its potential impact on the field. Based on the research results, we suggest further exploration and development of the U-Net + ResNet34 model. This proposed model is designed for the recognition and pixel-based localization of clinical symptoms and canine eye diseases, with a primary focus on achieving the highest Intersection-over-union (IoU) scores for individual and combined classes. The adjustments made to enhance robustness and practicality aim to facilitate effective decision-making for non-specialized veterinary applications. In the domain of veterinary ophthalmology, this research embodies both promise and challenge. The author's machine learning model for diagnosing ocular diseases in canines indicates precision and accessibility, redefining the boundaries of diagnostic capability. The model's diagnostic accuracy is essential to this achievement, reflected in Intersection over Union (IoU) scores that surpass 80 % for a particular class. It empowers veterinarians and pet owners with a dependable, user-friendly tool for the early detection of ocular diseases. This decentralization of diagnosis paves the way for improved treatment outcomes, which will eventually promote the well-being of canine patients. Acknowledging these leaps, it is vital to confront the inherent constraints that frame this study. The dataset, while carefully assembled, remains but a fragment of the expansive clinical landscape. Therefore, as in computer vision tasks, the pursuit of larger and more diverse datasets is imperative to augment the model's generalizability. Furthermore, the specter of subjectivity in data interpretation, despite expert oversight, may benefit from collaboration with a panel of specialists to mitigate individual bias. The exploration of alternative hyperparameter configurations remains pivotal for enhancing the model's precision and robustness. A notable constraint comes in the form of scalability. The dataset needs updating and rebalancing with each new disease that justifies inclusion. This task proves complex, as diseases occur with varying frequencies, potentially making dataset maintenance an ongoing challenge. Real-world application and seamless integration into clinical settings represent uncharted terrain. Bridging the gap between model development and practical deployment remains a focal point. Simultaneously, the constant need for vigilance is required by ethical and privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with legal and moral standards. The path ahead offers numerous avenues for refinement. Collaboration with Specialists: Engaging a panel of veterinary experts further elevates data interpretation and model calibration. Hyperparameter Exploration: Exhaustive hyperparameter exploration can result in more precise and adaptable models. Real-World Integration: Integration into clinical systems and real-world deployment demands exploration. Ethical and Regulatory Adherence: Ongoing commitment to ethical and regulatory compliance is imperative. In sum, this research embodies a juncture where technology converges with veterinary practice, elevating the skill of ocular disease diagnosis. In this context, benefits, limitations, and the path ahead converge to extend the reach and influence of veterinary ophthalmology.

11467404,A flexible and fast digital twin for RRAM systems applied for training resilient neural networks,"Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) has gained considerable momentum due to its non-volatility and energy efficiency. Material and device scientists have been proposing novel material stacks that can mimic the “ideal memristor” which can deliver performance, energy efficiency, reliability and accuracy. However, designing RRAM-based systems is challenging. Engineering a new material stack, designing a device, and experimenting takes significant time for material and device researchers. Furthermore, the acceptability of the device is ultimately decided at the system level. We see a gap here where there is a need for facilitating material and device researchers with a “push button” modeling framework that allows to evaluate the efficacy of the device at system level during early device design stages. Speed, accuracy, and adaptability are the fundamental requirements of this modelling framework. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-like modeling framework that automatically creates RRAM device models from device measurement data. Furthermore, the model incorporates the peripheral circuit to ensure accurate energy and performance evaluations. We demonstrate the DT generation and DT usage for multiple RRAM technologies and applications and illustrate the achieved performance of our GPU implementation. We conclude with the application of our modeling approach to measurement data from two distinct fabricated devices, validating its effectiveness in a neural network processing an Electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset and incorporating Fault Aware Training (FAT).","Resistive Random-Access Memories (RRAMs) are promising due to their built-in non-volatility and since they can perform Vector-Matrix-Multiplication (VMM) of arbitrarily large inputs with constant computational complexity  Surprisingly, despite attempts to address this challenge, we found that there is a lack of models which are (a) fast to simulate, (b) accurate and (c) easy to adapt to new devices and/or programming algorithms. While various modelling approaches exist, these tend to be lacking in one or more of these criteria, hindering system-level development and - subsequently - adoption. These efforts are fundamental for RRAM research since recent research indicates that e.g. individual instances of artificial neural networks react quite differently to device variations In this work, we propose a solution to the before-mentioned challenge. We implemented an end-to-end modelling flow for the generation and usage of Digital Twins (DTs) in a fully automated manner, as depicted in Fig.  We showcase the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed model through its application to three distinct domains. Firstly, leveraging the inherent non-volatility of RRAMs, we explore their potential application as memory, where ongoing research focuses on diverse error correction approaches. Secondly, we illustrate the suitability of RRAMs for real-time applications at the Edge, particularly in tasks like Edge detection. Lastly, we investigate the suitability of two distinct different device technologies for the implementation of ANN. We derived measurement data for  This is not the first work attempting to model memristive devices, significant efforts have been spent on creating simulation environments for both memory and compute applications of memristive devices at different levels of abstraction: At the lower levels of abstraction researchers have devised atomistic To the best of the authors knowledge none of the existing works can achieve simulation speeds which are competitive with the results reported in this work while being as easy to fit to new measurement data and/or a different application domain. Furthermore, limiting RRAM models to the mere device itself lacks substantial information about the surrounding circuit, both regarding area and power draw. Subsequently, we integrated the capability to model surrounding circuitry. This approach has been used successfully to design and evaluate a RISC-V One of the key contributions of the proposed modelling technique lies within the fully automated flow from raw measurements to system-level evaluation; A new generation of RRAM devices, a different wafer or a novel programming algorithm can be modelled by pressing a single button (Fig.  Proposed approach. Generating Digital Twins from measurement data is fully automated (brown box). This can be used to create many individual Digital Twins, each covering a different variability aspect (middle). These can be integrated seamlessly in various simulation environments in order to validate a given application or system architecture (yellow box). A significant number of devices have to be characterized to adequately capture the device behavioural model. To ease this measurement phase, the  Forming voltage sweep: 2.0 V to 5.0 V using steps of 0.01 V and a pulse duration of  Reset/set voltage sweep: 0.5 V to 2.0 V using steps of 0.1 V and a pulse duration of  Read operation: A single 0.2 V pulse.

Subsequently, we derive the individual DT as follows; The percentage of stuck-at-HRS devices can be derived automatically by counting the occurrences of high-resistive (e.g. x The measurements taken for the  HRS/LRS characteristics of  This section describes key aspects of rendering the proposed model fast enough to support both large crossbars and the evaluation of large systems. The model itself is application agnostic, a given Digital Twin can be seamlessly evaluated across application domains. More details are described in the Methodology section. The fundamental concept can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the to-be-written state is selected by the application. Next, the model samples the “baseline” from the first to-be-used distribution which has been found for a given variation type (typically device-to device variation), including the mean. Further variations are added arithmetically by ignoring the mean of the corresponding distribution. The resulting energy usage (provided by the model annotations) is provided to the application. Secondly, during the read operation, the simulated resistance value is compared to the parametrized ADC, determining which digitized state this would correlate to, again providing the energy usage for the system-level evaluation. This procedure has to be repeated for each individual device. We found that this can be implemented on GPU without major data dependencies by spawning an individual CUDA thread per RRAM device. This ultimately leads to impressive overall simulation performance while only moderately taxing GPU memory (up to about  There are two fundamental approaches to integrate a digital twin containing multiple variation modules into a simulation environment. Firstly, one could sample each kind of distribution for each kind of device and each individual variation module and store the result in memory. This is advisable when a lot of operations are required since the computational complexity of retrieving the current state of the memristor is  We implemented a prototype to evaluate whether this holds for an actual simulation. We evaluated its performance by programming to  We have implemented a memory simulator using the proposed concept. A memory block is accessed randomly, setting individual RRAM devices to individual states. In order to achieve sufficient performance we ported our model to CUDA and ran it on a NVIDIA H100 GPU. The achieved equivalent simulation speed for differently sized memory blocks is depicted in Fig.  We have implemented an application which uses individual (simulated)  ( RRAM devices tend to be affected by multiple types of variability (such as e.g. device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations) simultaneously, which need to be taken into consideration for system-level evaluations. Subsequently, multiple types of device variability need to be simulated simultaneously, ultimately slowing down the achieved simulation speed. We performed multiple simulations which program  This section describes the validation of the D2D module using a separate set of data received from  Firstly, a model has been created using measurement data from a specific wafer of  The histogram drawn from these write operations on wafer b is depicted in Fig.  Our efforts to validate the usage of parallel  Results: ( Given the notable speed of the proposed model, it seamlessly integrates into widely used NN frameworks. This integration facilitates the introduction of device faults to the network during the training phase, empowering the model to enhance its resilience to such faults. While the concept itself is not new, the rapid processing capabilities of our model allow its application across NNs of varying sizes. We exemplify this by employing the model to implement FAT in an NN designed for detecting cardiovascular diseases using ECG data sourced from the “China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC)” dataset ( Within this work we have demonstrated a modelling approach which helps mitigate two crucial aspects: Firstly, it outperforms existing modelling works by multiple orders of magnitude (as a result of being fully GPU compatible). Secondly, it resembles a push-button approach to modelling, being easy to fit to new devices or individual programming algorithms. While this model cannot predict the behaviour of hypothetical devices due to the fact that it is not a physics-based model it can emulate existing devices with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have illustrated its portability by integrating it into quite different application domains. Our memory emulation benchmark achieved multiple GB/s of effective simulation speed on a HPC GPU, which - to the best of the authors knowledge - outperforms any previous work. We illustrated that this model can be ported to a CPU implementation seamlessly, allowing for the evaluation of a real-time application. Lastly, our model enabled us to apply Fault Aware Training to a neural network, allowing the training procedure to adapt to two different types of RRAM devices. More implementation details are outlined in the next section. The implemented approach is summarized in Fig.  Proposed framework: The evaluation begins with taking measurement data of RRAM devices (covering a given variation type) and combining them with circuit parametrizations to create a Digital Twin (red box). After selecting variation types (green box) these can be integrated into different applications to evaluate and/or mitigate the effects of device variations (yellow box). Lastly, the individual DT can be validated with additional measurement data (blue box). Although a materials exploration is beyond the scope of this work, we selected two different RRAM devices in order to evaluate the technological independence and flexibility of our framework. This section describes the fabrication of the two types of devices. The  The  Figure  I-V characteristics of the utilized memristive devices. The black line depicts the median of individual measurements. This section describes how to create an individual DT from raw measurement data (Fig.  Within this section we will explain how we rendered the proposed approach universal and ensured it meets performance requirements (Fig.  GPUs use the Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) approach to process many threads in parallel. A prominent example, namely ANN applications, have mostly moved to GPU processing since these provide significantly more compute capacity (about 67 TFLOP/s on a recent NVIDIA H100 Fortunately, RRAM devices are largely independent from each other, which allowed us to spawn threads without data dependencies without being bottlenecked by data transfers. Subsequently, we spawn one thread per RRAM device and spread them on the SMX units containing CUDA cores using the grid interface provided by the CUDA API. Locality effects can be covered using either the grid-thread mapping interface or by setting a cutoff distance (as typical for MD simulation frameworks) accordingly, preventing data movement bottlenecks. However, this needs to be easily accessible from an implementation-agnostic interface - the RRAM researcher should not have to deal with implementation details. Subsequently, we implemented this by initializing a PyTorch tensor per memory block accordingly and using CUDA kernels to act on them. This combination allows for eased integration into a given framework while still providing the full control of using CUDA directly. This GPU implementation can be ported to any language which is interoperable with CUDA without the need to rewrite the model itself. We used this implementation to perform a memory simulation using RRAM-blocks as storage simulating differently sized memories. This yields the performance as reported in Fig.  While a CPU is fundamentally easier to program than a GPU, creating as many threads as on a GPU is not feasible. Nevertheless, a model needs to be compatible since a lot of devices such as laptops or embedded devices might not have a dedicated GPU. Fortunately, a lot of effort has been spent on rendering CPU implementations of iterator patterns within programming languages reasonably fast We used this approach to evaluate the suitability of  The CPU needs to simulate an increasing number of crossbars while still meeting real-time requirements. Fortunately, as depicted in the performance graph in Fig.  Results: We use the DT to evaluate the suitability of  The concept of FAT has been proposed by Zahid et al. PyTorch provides the “tensor” data structure, yielding objects that can be stored and evaluated fast on a GPU. However, this proved not flexible enough to cover all aspects of RRAM models. Subsequently, we have split up our implementation into parts which can be implemented using Tensors and parts which need to be implemented with CUDA and combined them into one coherent implementation. The performance characteristics are similar to the memory simulation described earlier. This approach tries to find a middle ground: For the forward pass, the device faults are applied in a way that is similar to the quantization. To do so, a wrapper for the Digital Twin has been integrated into a custom pre/postquantizer block utilized within the custom Brevitas implementation. A matrix correlating to the stuck devices is constructed for the backward pass. Firstly, each element is initialized with ones (Eq.  As described in a previous section coupling two RRAM devices to form a single weight was neccesary when training for the  Subsequently, we applied both quantization aware training and FAT using the proposed DT approach. We configured the training procedure in such a way that device variation effects would start occuring from epoch 100. The resulting training procedure for the first 150 epochs when using the  This figure depicts the individual training procedures when training neural networks to detect the morbidities as prevalent in the CPSC dataset.

11467093,Moss spores: overlooked airborne bioparticles in an urban environment,"Moss spores are present in aerobiological samples, but their low representation, lack of known allergenic properties, and difficult identification have led to their being overlooked by aerobiologists so far. The data about their presence in the atmosphere and the factors that influence them are, however, important from the biodiversity conservation point of view, since they give us information about their ability to spread to new habitats. In this pilot study, we analysed their presence in the atmosphere of Bratislava city, Slovakia (2018–2023), using Burkard volumetric sampler, and determined the most significant factors influencing its temporal distribution. The size category of 13–18 µm was the most represented in the samples. Environmental factors influenced the daily spore concentrations and the characteristics of the whole spore season. The start of the Main Spore Season (MSS) depended mainly on the temperatures in November–January, initiating earlier growth of sporophytes in the following year, while the intensity of the MSS was influenced by high humidity in April, stimulating the formation of spores in sporangia. The daily concentration of airborne moss spores was mostly influenced by the actual temperature and wind speed, promoting the release and dispersal of spores, and precipitation lowering their levels due to the “wash-out” effect, although no intradiurnal pattern was observed. More data from other locations is needed to determine the role of atmospheric spore transport for the conservation of moss species facing anthropogenic climatic change. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11356-024-35028-5.","Mosses (division Bryophyta) are non-vascular spore-bearing plants, consisting of some 12,000 species worldwide (Goffinet & Buck  Mosses reproduce asexually by production of vegetative propagules or fragmentation of gametophytes and sexually by meiospores which are passively dispersed in the environment predominantly by air currents (Hutsemekers et al.  The concentration of airborne moss spores depends primarily on meiospore production of the parental organisms, the mechanism of their discharge from the capsule and meteorological conditions. In general, moisture is required for the fertilization process and formation of sporophytes. Evidence of high spore production for species with small spores (7–20 μm) is evident; for instance, a single sporangium in  Despite the inaccuracy of the widely accepted statement that mosses only absorb water and nutrients together with the pollutants from the atmosphere (Varela et al.  Despite the decades-long permanent aerobiological monitoring, attention is primarily focused on pollen grains and fungal spores and information about other bioparticles in the atmosphere, including moss spores, and their spatio-temporal variability is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a pilot spatio-temporal examination of airborne moss spore occurrence within the inland temperate climate with regards to their size. Additionally, the effects of meteorological parameters and air pollutants on their levels in the air were assessed. Aerobiological samples were collected in the city of Bratislava (48°08′ N, 17°06′ E, 152 m a. s. l., 367.7 km Location of spore sampler in Bratislava. Forested areas are mainly represented by Carpathian deciduous forests The climate in the study area is temperate continental. The detailed descriptions of the weather conditions in Bratislava can be based on meteorological data from the period 2010–2023 obtained from the Bratislava–Mlynská dolina meteorological station (located 500 m apart from the aerobiological sampler). The mean annual air temperature was 11.4 °C with the highest mean monthly temperature recorded in July (22.0 °C) and the lowest in January (0.3 °C). The average precipitation is 602 mm/year with the highest rainfall in the May˗September period. Over the studied years (2018–2023), the highest mean annual temperature (12.2 °C) and precipitation (1170.9 mm) were recorded in 2023. The lowest temperature (10.8 °C) was recorded in 2021 and the lowest precipitation (830.4 mm) in 2022. Despite the relatively dry and warm climate and low altitude, 245 bryophyte taxa have been recorded in the study area (Janovicová et al.  The concentration of airborne moss spores was measured from 1 March to 30 November (275 daily samples per year) for six consecutive years (2018‒2023), using a Hirst-type volumetric aerospore trap (Burkard Manufacturing Co Ltd.). The sampler was located on the rooftop (N 48.14973, E 17.07375) at 18 m a. g. l., thus avoiding the barrier effect of urban development on airflow. At this altitude, the air is sufficiently mixed and, in addition to aeroparticles of local origin, also contains those that are remotely transported (Lacey & West  The volumetric sampler sucks in 10 l of air per minute. The air inside hits an adhesive tape placed on a rotating drum, where aeroparticles are captured on a vaseline coating. The drum revolves with a speed of 2 mm/h and turns completely in 7 days, determining the changing interval of the exposed tape. The tape was then cut into segments, each representing a daily exposure, and microscopic slides were prepared by mounting them in glycerol gelatine and staining with fuchsin. Moss spores were identified and counted along twelve vertical transects per slide, each corresponding to two hours, using a light microscope with a magnification of 400 × (Galán et al.  The Main Spore Season (MSS) was determined as the period that includes 90% of the total annual spore concentration (Annual Spore Integral – ASIn). Therefore, the MSS signifies the interval during which the cumulative sum of mean daily spore concentrations ranges from 5 to 95% of the total annual spore concentration (Nilsson & Persson  The effects of the environmental variables on moss spore concentration during the MSS in Bratislava were analysed using Poisson regression with a logarithmic link function.

Analysis of the studied years showed significant differences in relative humidity in April, influencing the value of SSIn in the given year. The highest SSIn was recorded in 2023, when the mean relative humidity in April reached 81% (27% above the long-term average 1983–2023, SHMÚ), while the 44% relative humidity in April 2020 (31% below the long-term average) was followed by the lowest SSIn (Fig.  Seasonal Spore Integral (SSIn) and mean daily values of relative humidity in April in Bratislava Table  Significant environmental variables in Poisson regression model for airborne moss spore concentration in Bratislava over the Main Spore Sason, years 2018−2023 The spores of mosses, as highly efficient wind-dispersed organisms (see Patiño & Vanderpoorten  The airborne moss spores quantity depends on their size, sporangia placement above ground, the size and distribution of source populations and their proximity to the sampling equipment and meteorological conditions.

The ASIn ranged from 124 to 367 spore*day/m In Central Europe, many mosses sporulate during the vegetation season between April and September, resulting in the highest airborne spore concentration (Stark  No intradiurnal pattern was observed in the aerobiological data, which can be explained by the heat island effect in an urban environment. The near-surface layer of the troposphere remains dynamic even during the evening and nighttime hours, thus preventing spore sedimentation in the evening (Jones & Harrison  Regarding the timing and intensity of the MSS, we noted that its start depended mainly on the temperatures in November–January preceding sporulation. Warm temperatures during these months probably initiate earlier growth of sporophytes, similar to the flowering woody plants in spring influencing the onset of their pollen seasons (Schramm et al.  The results of the statistical analysis show a dependence of airborne moss spore levels on a combination of several environmental parameters. The positive impact of temperature and wind speed and the negative impact of precipitation are similar to their influence on other airborne bioparticles, like pollen grains and fungal spores (Grinn-Gofroń & Bosiacka  CO was found to act as a potent antioxidant in plants, protecting them against oxidative damage caused by biotic and abiotic stressors (Sa et al.  We have conducted a pilot study of the presence of moss spores in the samples from the aerobiological trap in Bratislava (2018–2023). Our results show a relatively low representation of this type of bioparticles, despite their characteristics suitable for aerial transport, possibly explained by their preference for closed forest habitats from which they rarely enter free stream air transport. There are several limitations to this type of studies, since the morphological characteristics of Bryophyte spores do not enable accurate identification of genera and their low abundance in the air is an obstacle to metagenomic studies. Without proper identification, it is not possible to determine the possible differences in the responses of individual taxa to environmental factors. Cultivation of spores would be needed for correct identification, but this is not possible from aerobiological samples without some additional spore capture. Since the aerobiological trap placement can have a great role in the ratio of captured local spores to spores originating in long-distance transport, further studies with different sampler placement (including close to the ground in forested areas) are needed to learn more about the aerobiological pathway of moss spores. It is important to study the presence of Bryophyte spores in the air despite their lack of allergenic molecules (as known so far) since long-distance transport of moss spores is important for colonising new habitats in the light of the recent climatic change and anthropogenic activities impacting them with gradual loss of their preferred habitats.

However, recent comparative studies on metric learning ( Because of the structural complexity and density of the organelle networks, their fine structural details cannot be effectively represented by the high-level semantic features obtained after multiple layers of convolution operations.

In particular, our study highlights the importance of low-level features. Many deep learning models are designed originally for natural images.

We have developed resources for further studies of intracellular organelle networks, a distinct class of dynamic and distributed networks for bioinformatics research. The resources include open-access datasets of intracellular organelle networks, ER and MITO, to support the development of new deep learning segmentation models. We have also developed methods and software to analyze dynamic morphological and topological properties of intracellular organelle networks. Both conventional and deep learning methods have been developed for the segmentation of fluorescence microscopy images ( Over the past decade, deep learning has reshaped nearly all areas of computer vision.

The computational demands of MRE are nontrivial, and further validation across a broader range of organelle networks is necessary.

11466868,"Automated pipeline for denoising, missing data processing, and feature extraction for signals acquired via wearable devices in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis applications","The incorporation of health-related sensors in wearable devices has increased their use as essential monitoring tools for a wide range of clinical applications. However, the signals obtained from these devices often present challenges such as artifacts, spikes, high-frequency noise, and data gaps, which impede their direct exploitation. Additionally, clinically relevant features are not always readily available. This problem is particularly critical within the H2020 BRAINTEASER project, funded by the European Community, which aims at developing models for the progression of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using data from wearable devices. The objective of this study is to present the automated pipeline developed to process signals and extract features from the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch, which has been chosen as the primary wearable device in the BRAINTEASER project. The proposed pipeline includes a signal processing step, which applies retiming, gap-filling, and denoising algorithms to enhance the quality of the data. The feature extraction step, on the other hand, utilizes clinical partners' knowledge and feedback to select the most relevant variables for analysis. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed automated pipeline have been evaluated through pivotal beta testing sessions, which demonstrated the ability of the pipeline to improve the data quality and extract features from the data. Further clinical validation of the extracted features will be performed in the upcoming steps of the BRAINTEASER project. Developed in Python, this pipeline can be used by researchers for automated signal processing and feature extraction from wearable devices. It can also be easily adapted or modified to suit the specific requirements of different scenarios.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are chronic conditions characterized by a progressive decline in motor and cognitive neurological functions. Although they are distinct diseases, they present similar challenges for patients and the healthcare system ( BRAINTEASER (BRinging Artificial INTelligencE home for a better cAre of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple SclERosis) (www.brainteaser.health) is a project funded by the European Horizon 2020 initiative, which aims to deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies for the daily home care of MS and ALS. In this context, AI is considered a key element in meeting the needs of both patients and clinicians. Specifically, AI methodologies can be utilized to analyze the progression of MS and ALS, allowing for the capture and handling of patients’ inter-variability, and providing tools for forecasting disease evolution ( The structure of the paper is the following. We will start by presenting the BRAINTEASER project and its aims, and the rationale behind the selection of the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch and, by exploiting the feedback received from the clinical teams in the project, we will show the procedure we applied to identify the most useful signals and features. Then, we will illustrate in detail the automated pipeline we developed to obtain signals with improved quality and extract relevant features for AI-based models employed in BRAINTEASER. Finally, we will conclude by thoroughly defining all the extracted features, and in the last section, we will present the effectiveness of the automated pipeline by evaluating the result of its application to pivotal beta testing sessions. The BRAINTEASER project aims at exploiting clinically relevant features extracted from wearable devices to feed AI-based models to monitor and predict the progression of ALS and MS chronic diseases. Before selecting the wearable device, there was the need to better understand which signals could be potentially relevant, from the clinical point of view, for the two considered diseases. Both ALS and MS have multiple degradation effects on many vital functions of patients, especially related to respiration, blood oxygenation, and fatigue. These symptoms have been studied and analyzed in recent years by many research teams, to better understand their connection with the disease and its progression. Heart rate and related features have been identified as significantly different between individuals with each respective disease and healthy subjects ( To further validate these findings with hands-on input, we asked the clinical partners of the BRAINTEASER project to provide a list of desired features to collect from the wearable device, their priority, and the ideal sampling rate. For MS, Fondazione Istituto Neurologico Nazionale Casimiro Mondino (IT) and Servicio Madrileño de Salud (ES) are the clinical partners involved in BRAINTEASER and their teams identified a very high priority for activity-related signals, such as daily steps, burnt calories, and the raw accelerometer data. They also identified the tracking of respiration rate and  The clinical input provided expert-based information for identifying the device’s requirements. Subsequently, a more technical analysis of the available devices was conducted. We focused on wrist-worn devices because of their ease of use, small impact on the patient’s life, wide availability, and ability to collect signals such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and blood oxygen concentration. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in order to identify the devices utilized in similar studies. Additionally, we thoroughly explored the manufacturer websites to obtain a more profound understanding of the capabilities and functionalities of each device. Compared wearable devices with a brief summary of the identified advantages and disadvantages. After considering all previously listed aspects, the BRAINTEASER project agreed to select the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s as the one that best fits the clinical and technical needs. The Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s (Garmin Ltd, Olathe, KS, USA) is a smartwatch that comes in two sizes and allows collecting all the signals identified in  List of health-related signals available from the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s. Of course, as discussed in  As far as the accelerometer signal is concerned, its high sampling rate would potentially lead to a high amount of data management and processing. Furthermore, its continuous collection greatly reduces the battery life to a few hours. Due to these considerations, we chose to drop this signal. However, the inclusion of accelerometer data in future studies remains relevant to these diseases. Despite the difficulties associated with its ongoing collection, it has the potential to enhance the understanding of these conditions and should be considered whenever feasible. For this project, we have chosen to use steps and calories as a proxy for physical activity information since they are readily obtainable from the device. These two specific data types represent the cumulative sum of steps performed and calories burned up to the current moment. Regarding Stress and Body battery signals, all clinical partners agreed that they would be beneficial to track. However, these signals are computed by Garmin and there is neither information nor validation on how these variables are calculated by the manufacturer, as well as no info on their clinical validity. The previous considerations led all the partners to agree on discarding these signals as well. Finally, an additional note on the  The final list of signals to be collected, analyzed, and processed with the pipeline presented in this work (see  Final list of health-related signals and the selected sampling rate exploited in the BRAINTEASER project after the device capabilities analysis and usability considerations. The AI models require as input clinically relevant features that are computed from the signals collected with the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s and allow for a summary of the most important signal characteristics. In this section, we present the processing pipeline that has been designed and developed in Python aimed at extracting clinically relevant features.  Complete processing pipeline. It can be divided into two parts: the first three blocks are devoted to signal processing, to improve the quality of the raw data by retiming the input to a fixed sampling grid, filling data gaps, and removing noise, whereas the last block performs the extraction of clinically-relevant features. All the collected signals need to be processed before being usable for feature extraction. In our pipeline, the signal processing consists of three steps specifically tuned to deal with the characteristics of each signal. The first step is the retiming of the signal, which aims at bringing all data points to a uniform time grid. Indeed, input data might have a non-constant sampling grid and this may bias the calculation of the features. Being our final aim of feature extraction, this aspect represents a clear problem. Retiming is implemented by an algorithm that averages all input data points to the closest output grid point. In this way, the original data are preserved and only translated to the constant time grid. The average is reduced to a sum in the case of cumulative data types, such as daily calories and steps. The second step is gap-filling. Indeed, the data can have missing values, and the presence of missing values can bias the calculation of the features and any further analysis. Several strategies have been investigated to reliably fill data gaps. Since a priori information on wearable-derived data was not available, it has been decided to employ a simple but effective strategy, i.e., fill missing values by linear interpolation of nearby values. This choice is also functional since it allows performing all the feature extraction algorithms without introducing major changes in the dynamics of the wearable-derived data. It is also worth noting that there is no difference between gaps caused by the sensor itself and by non-wearing periods. The ad-hoc procedure we developed consists first of automatically identifying fillable gaps for each input signal, then filling them by linear interpolation only those whose duration is equal or inferior to the limits reported in  For each signal, the maximum time gap that allows linear interpolation is reported. Note that not all signals can be processed with the gap-filling procedure, e.g., steps and calorie signals skip the gap-filling block because of their non-continuous nature, both being aggregated samples over their sampling period. Finally, the third processing step is denoising. Due to the sensor’s characteristics, some noise overlapped with the true signal is always expected. In the case of wearable devices, this might be caused, for example, by device movement on the user’s wrist, sweating, jumps, etc., which all lead to outliers and general noise in the collected data. To improve the quality of the signals before performing the feature extraction, since no a priori information on wearable-derived data was available, we decided to adopt a very robust methodology for denoising that does not require any a priori information on the wearable-derived data, i.e., a moving average algorithm. The algorithm works by calculating the average of data points within a sliding window. This sliding window moves through the time series data, and at each position, it computes the average value of the data points within the window. This process effectively smooths out variations and reduces high-frequency noise in the data, making it a suitable choice for enhancing data quality without requiring prior information about the characteristics of the wearable-derived data. The default window is three samples wide, but it can be easily customized in the code and passed as parameter to the processing functions. The output of the data processing pipeline (i.e., the first three blocks in  The explored features focus on the time, frequency, and geometric domains. In particular, the latter domain is explored by resorting to the Poincaré plot, which allows easy visualization and analysis of recursive signals like heart rate. This method and the geometric features that can be extracted from the plot are widely used in heart rate variability analysis, thus those features have been included in the list of important features for the project ( Heart rate variability is correlated with the presence of ALS and MS ( Complete list of features for heart rate and beat-to-beat signals. The latter is derived by the inversion of the heart rate signal. Sleeping hours are a vital time to watch. Numerous physiological indicators, including respiratory rate and  Complete list of features for pulse oximetry signal. Complete list of features for respiration rate signal. The pipeline for signal processing and feature extraction has been validated using sample data collected during the project’s development period and the initial phase of patient enrollment. This data was obtained from 10 subjects participating in the BRAINTEASER clinical trial, including both ALS and MS patients. The subjects wore the Garmin Vivoactive 4s device in an outpatient setting without any specific tasks for data collection. The subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of A.O.U. Città della salute e della scienza di Torino (314/2021). In this work, we present the results on a representative subject with ALS, who used the device for 7 days to acquire a comprehensive data set that encompasses both daytime and nighttime periods. During this period, this individual engaged in various physical activities, which enabled the verification of the collected data’s quality and the assessment of the efficiency of the processing pipeline in eliminating potential artifacts resulting from the device’s movement on the wrist. The data presented here, as well as additional sample data, can be found in the repository linked as  The sample dataset contains some of the expected artifacts that the processing pipeline is asked to remove/correct. For instance, the sleeping time signal presents some peaks that could be a consequence of the wrong positioning of the device or compression of the sensor due to movement during sleep. Moreover, all signals present data gaps of different durations, which need to be identified and filled by linear interpolation if the gap duration is lower or equal to the limits previously. The results of the signal processing pipeline, comprising the initial three blocks outlined in  Example of the outcome of the application of the signal processing pipeline (first three blocks of  These results illustrate the varying susceptibility of different signals to artifacts. Specifically, the heart rate signal obtained from the wearable device was found to be suitable for feature extraction without the need for further processing. Conversely, the  The cleaned sample was utilized to extract sample features that will serve as input to the AI models.

List of the extracted features from the respiration rate sample signal. In this study, the validity and impact of the extracted features on model performance have not been directly evaluated. This evaluation is important to understand the effect of the pipeline on model performance. However, such an analysis would necessitate the complete development of dedicated ALS/MS models to fully leverage the features extracted by our pipeline, which is a matter of ongoing research and is out of the scope of the present manuscript. Of course, once these models are finalized within the framework of the BRAINTEASER project, future investigations will explore the impact of our processing and feature extraction steps on their performance. Health signals obtained from wearable devices present a valuable source of monitoring data for chronic diseases, and AI models can leverage this information to predict disease progression. In the context of the BRAINTEASER project, the Garmin Vivoactive 4 was selected as the device for training the AI models for monitoring the progression of MS and ALS. This paper presents the processing pipeline developed and intended for deployment in the BRAINTEASER project. This pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art techniques and addresses the requirements for analyzing these signals in a real-world consumer scenario. While numerous current techniques concentrate on high-frequency data obtained from specialized and case-specific sensors, this approach utilizes a readily accessible consumer device and their built-in sensors and features, such as optical sensors and pulse-oximeters. During the development and signal selection process, it was crucial to incorporate input from clinicians to ensure the extraction of necessary features and focus on the most relevant signals for the specific situation. The selection process also considered additional engineering and usability factors. However, as a result, the accelerometer data was discarded. It is worth noting that the readings from the accelerometer can be valuable for a variety of functionality assessments, particularly those related to motor skills. This interdisciplinary approach is of paramount importance to guarantee that the processing is performed on valuable signals for the specific case. This process results in the extraction of useful features that can be utilized in subsequent analysis steps or, for example, displayed in a monitoring interface. The proposed pipeline has been developed to work on data covering one day, but it can also process data in shorter time windows. However, when using shorter time windows, the consistency of certain features should be ensured the consistency of certain features. Regardless of the time window, patterns over multiple days can be analyzed at a later stage by comparing the extracted features and metrics as necessary. The proposed pipeline will be implemented in the BRAINTEASER project and continuously refined to meet the specific requirements of its application in the project. Future work will involve examining the noise characteristics of data obtained from wearable devices and evaluating various advanced noise-filtering approaches. One possible approach is to utilize Kalman filtering, as investigated in the study cited in (","['smartwatches', 'processing', 'feature extraction', 'health data', 'wearable devices', 'long-term health monitoring']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Digital Health,"""std"""
11466866,What distinguishes life satisfaction from emotional wellbeing?,"The aim of this registered report is to investigate how the core components of subjective wellbeing, Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB), differ with respect to their relationship to antecedent factors. Seven factors are proposed that have been found in previous research to antecede LS and EWB. Social Comparisons, Meaningfulness, Economic/Social Resources, and Opportunities are hypothesized to correlate more closely with LS than EWB, while Time Use, Hassles/Uplifts, and Neuroticism are hypothesized to correlate more strongly with EWB than LS. A combined online and paper-and-pencil survey was administered to a representative sample of 974 Swedish citizens aged 15 years or older. LS and EWB were measured by self-report methods that have been developed and used in previous research. Index measures were constructed from self-reports of each antecedent factor by means of ratings on two scales developed in this study. Multivariate regression and relative weight analyses confirmed two of the hypotheses in showing that Economic/Social Resources and Opportunities were significantly more strongly related with LS than EWB. Of those hypothesized to correlate more strongly with EWB than LS, support was obtained for Neuroticism. Social Comparisons, Meaningfulness, Time Use, and Hassles/Uplifts did not have different relationships with LS and EWB. The results confirm that to some extent antecedent factors are differentially associated with LS and EWB, thus contributing to a better understanding of the antecedents of the cognitive and affective components of subjective wellbeing. Future research should further explore the mechanisms underlying these different relationships as well as moderators and mediators of the relationships.","Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is generally proposed to include two primary components: Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB) (Diener,  The relationship between LS and EWB is generally positive, with correlation coefficients typically ranging from moderate to strong ( Instead of relying solely on verbal reports, many studies have examined the associations between measures of LS and EWB in relation to different life circumstances. In an empirical study involving samples of women from the United States and France, Kahneman et al. ( Further support for the differences between LS and EWB arises from research indicating that EWB is more influenced than LS by time pressure in everyday life (e.g., Gärling et al.,  A complete understanding is lacking of why certain antecedents have different relationships with LS and EWB. People may directly consider stable life circumstances when making assessments of LS but also explicitly or implicitly place weight on other factors associated with these circumstances—factors which are more important for LS than EWB. In this registered report we propose the following four factors: social comparisons, economic and social resources, opportunities, and meaningfulness. Related to social comparisons, LS inherently carries a comparative aspect with individuals gauging their contentment in relation to others, perhaps employing a “good fortune” heuristic as suggested by Kahneman and Krueger ( According to Hypothesis 3, the presence of economic and social resources, both tangible and intangible (Gärling and Gamble,  An illustration of how the four hypotheses may explain differences between LS and EWB observed in previous research is the following. Unemployment has in several studies been shown to be related more strongly to low LS than low EWB (Knabe et al.,  For a full picture, it should furthermore be recognized that some factors may have stronger relationship with EWB than LS. Kahneman et al. ( In total we propose seven hypotheses (summarized in  The hypotheses tested. LS, Life Satisfaction; EWB, Emotional Wellbeing. To sum up, several studies have compared antecedents of LS and EWB, but they have limitations. First, they have not comprehensively examined a wide range of theoretically meaningful factors within a single study. Second, they lack preregistration, making it unclear if results were obtained through confirmatory or exploratory analyses, potentially increasing false positives and publication bias. The present study aims to address these limitations by testing a comprehensive set of preregistered hypotheses about the relative strengths of relationships between antecedent factors and LS vs. EWB, using data from a large nationwide Swedish sample. To examine the correlations of the hypothesized eight factors with LS and EWB, we use data from a survey of a representative sample of the Swedish population aged 15 years or older. The survey is a combined online and paper-and-pencil replication of the 11th wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) in Sweden that was conducted as face-to-face interviews. Both the sampling procedure and survey content hence closely resemble the standard ESS 11 but with an added set of questions related to SWB. As a result, many questions unrelated to the research question are included in the survey. Mirroring the approach of ESS 11, a stratified sampling technique is employed, with random samples drawn from each of the eight NUTS-2 regions in Sweden. A total of 1,500 individuals were invited to participate and offered a conditional incentive of SEK 300 in the form of gift cards, while an additional 1,500 participants were invited without being offered any incentive. The purpose of offering incentive to one group and not to the other was to investigate potential non-response bias effects. Since not directly relevant to this study, the two samples were combined in the analyses to leverage the full data set. The final net sample consisted of 1,074 individuals (35.8% response rate); however, for the analyses, we only retained participants who provided complete responses to the analyzed survey questions (n = 974). The complete stage 1 study protocol, data, and R code files can be accessed and downloaded from the OSF link:  LS was assessed using the following two items: “Imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. Assume that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. If the top step is 10 and the bottom step is 0, on which step of the ladder do you personally stand right now?”; and “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays?” with end points labeled “0 Extremely dissatisfied” and “10 Extremely satisfied”. We employed merely two bipolar items to reduce the response burden while capturing evaluations that span from negative to positive wellbeing. This facilitates comparisons with EWB that likewise represents the wellbeing spectrum from negative to positive. It is consistent with Diener et al. ( EWB at the other end of the continuum is assessed by means of retrospective ratings of the frequency of emotions experienced during the past week. Six unipolar adjective scales with seven steps ranging from “never” (0) to “always” (6) were used. Each scale is defined by three adjectives taken from the Swedish Core Affect Scale (SCAS) (Västfjäll et al.,  In this study self-report measures were developed of the eight candidate factors (resources are separated in Economic and Social) hypothesized to have different correlations with LS and EWB. Each were measured with two items (translated into the English) as follows: Social comparisons: “I am more successful than others”; and “I have achieved more than others in my age.” Meaningfulness: “My life is meaningful”; and “I have goals in life that are very important to me.” Economic resources: “My economic resources are good”; and “I have a high material living standard.” Social resources: “I have good support from relatives, friends, and coworkers”; and “People in my surroundings are there for me.” Opportunities: “I have many opportunities to do what I want in life”; and “My life is full of opportunities.” Time use: “I have enough time to do the things I want to do”; and “I have time for relaxing activities.” Hassles and uplifts: “In my everyday life, I experience too many small disturbances or obstacles”; and “There are often things that uplift my everyday life.” Neuroticism: “I easily feel stressed and anxious”; and “I easily feel sad and depressed.” Descriptive statistics of the sample (n = 974). Means (M), standard deviations (SD), Cronbach's α, and product moment correlations of all variables ( Multivariate multiple regression (MMR) was employed to analyze the relationships between the dependent variables (LS and EWB) and the independent variables (social comparisons, meaningfulness, economic resources, social resources, opportunities, time use, hassles/uplifts, and neuroticism).

In addition to the MMR, a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA, Johnson,  The results show ( Relative importance (proportion of explained variance) of the association of the independent variables with Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB). Differences between Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB) (LS-EWB) in proportion explained variance estimated by relative weight analysis for each independent variable ( Differences in bold are statistically significant at the 5% level. This study aimed at investigating the differential relations a set of antecedent factors have with LS and EWB, the two primary components of SWB. Based on previous research and theoretical considerations, we tested seven different hypothesis regarding factors that relate differentially to LS and EWB. The findings provide partial support for the hypothesized differences in the correlations between these factors and LS and EWB, respectively. The multivariate multiple regression (MMR) analysis followed by a relative weight analysis (RWA) consistently showed that economic resources, social resources and opportunities are more strongly associated with LS than EWB, supporting Hypotheses 3a-b and 4. These results suggest that individuals' perceptions of their economic wealth, social support and future prospects play a more significant role for their life satisfaction than for their day-to-day emotional experiences. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of stable life circumstances for LS (Kahneman et al.,  The results provided additional consistent support for Hypothesis 3b, indicating that social resources are more important for LS than EWB. This finding suggests that the presence of supportive social networks may contribute more to individuals' life satisfaction than to their daily affective experiences, but this pattern is less pronounced than the difference in economic resources. Nevertheless, the finding is intriguing given that some previous research has pointed to the strong importance of social activities for EWB (Kahneman et al.,  The results also consistenly confirmed Hypothesis 7, demonstrating that neuroticism has a stronger relationship with EWB than with LS. This finding aligns with Schimmack et al.'s ( Results from both analyses did not support the hypothesized stronger relationship with LS than EWB of social comparisons (Hypothesis 1) and meaningfulness (Hypothesis 2). First, social comparisons (e.g., perceiving oneself to be more successful than others) were weakly related to both LS and EWB, with associations of similar magnitude, suggesting that relative comparisons may not be that important for LS (Veenhoven and Vergunst,  A compelling case can be made that meaningfulness is more important for LS than EWB, as people can find life meaningful even during periods of distress. However, our results do not support this proposition, as the associations between meaningfulness and both LS and EWB were similar and did not differ significantly. This finding suggests that the influence of meaningfulness on wellbeing may be more complex than hypothesized, and its effects on LS and EWB more intertwined than previously thought. The hypothesized stronger relationships of time use (Hypothesis 5) and hassles/uplifts (Hypothesis 6) with EWB compared to LS were not confirmed. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on LS and EWB may likewise be more complex than initially assumed, warranting further investigation. We also note that the hypothesis of time use being more important for EWB than LS is primarily based on the results of studies using the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). In the DRM (Kahneman et al.,  We expected hassles/uplifts to have a stronger relationship with EWB than LS, given the direct connection to daily affective states. However, our findings suggest that the cumulative effect of daily hassles/uplifts may also have substantially association with LS. Future research should employ more fine-grained measures that distinguish between recent and long-term experiences of hassles and uplifts to better grasp the nuances between their relationships to LS and EWB. This study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the different antecedents of LS and EWB. By identifying factors that may differentially influence these two components of SWB, the study provides a more nuanced understanding of the differences between LS and EWB. Our results may partly explain previous puzzles in the SWB research. For instance, a recent study of the unemployed (Fors Connolly and Gärling,  The strengths of this study include the use of a large representative sample and the application of both MMR and RWA to test the hypotheses. However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw causal inferences about these relationships. Future research employing longitudinal designs would provide further insights into their temporal dynamics. Second, the use of self-report measures may be subject to response biases, such as evaluative biases or biased recall (Schimmack,  A broader potential critique of our analysis is that we did not model SWB as a general factor with LS and EWB as specific factors (i.e., a bifactor model). This approach aligns with the study of Busseri and Quoidbach ( In conclusion, this study confirms that to some extent antecedent factors are differentially associated with LS and EWB, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between these two components of SWB. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at enhancing wellbeing should consider the unique determinants of LS and EWB, and that future research should further explores the mechanisms underlying these differential relationships. Future research should also investigate potential moderators or mediators that may influence the associations between the antecedent factors and the SWB components.","['antecedent factors', 'emotional wellbeing', 'life satisfaction', 'survey', 'Swedish citizens', 'subjective well-being']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Psychology,"""std"""
11466681,Coccygeal Nerve Blockade vs. Impar Ganglion Blockade in Coccydynia: A Randomised Clinical Trial,"Background and objective Coccydynia is a condition that causes pain around the coccyx, severely limiting functionality. Interventional treatment options are available for cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. Coccygeal nerve block (CnB) is a novel method for treating coccydynia. This study compared the efficacy of CnB and ganglion impar block (GiB) and aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CnB in treating coccydynia. Methods  The 12-week results of 56 patients were analysed. One group underwent ultrasound (US)-guided CnB, while the other group underwent fluoroscopy (FL)-guided GiB. Pain intensity was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS), and functionality was assessed using the PARIS Coccydynia Functionality Questionnaire. Evaluations were conducted before treatment, as well as four and 12 weeks after treatment. Results The baseline median NRS score was eight in both groups, while at week 12, it was three in the CnB group and 2.5 in the GiB group. The median PARIS score at baseline was seven in the CnB group and 6.5 in the GiB group, while at week 12, it was four and three, respectively. At week 12, compared to baseline, both the CNB and GiB groups showed statistically significant improvements in NRS and PARIS scores (p<0.001). When comparing the two groups, no significant difference was observed in the NRS and PARIS scores before and four and 12 weeks after treatment. No serious adverse events were observed in any patient. Conclusions  Coccydynia is sometimes refractory to treatment. In our study, we found that CnB, a method recently used in the treatment of coccydynia, was as effective as GiB, which has been used for a long time, and we found no evidence of superiority. The lack of radiation exposure due to its US-guided application, the superficial course of the coccygeal nerves and the low depth of needle penetration make it easier to perform. These advantages suggest that it will be a preferable method in the treatment of coccydynia.","Coccydynia is a condition characterised by pain around the coccyx, which can be caused by musculoskeletal conditions, infection, or malignancy. The etiology is often attributed to trauma or childbirth. Risk factors include female gender, obesity, rapid weight loss, variations in coccygeal morphology, and coccygeal hypermobility. It is more prevalent in middle-aged women [ Increased pain with sitting is a typical clinical presentation for coccydynia. Pain can be worsened by getting up from a sitting position, prolonged standing, the premenstrual period, sexual intercourse, and bowel movements [ Diagnosis of coccydynia is made using clinical and imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualise the sacrococcygeal joints and the distal coccyx bone and rule out secondary pathologies such as infection and tumours in this region. Dynamic MRI may also be used to diagnose coccygeal movement [ The impar ganglion, located anterior to the coccyx, is the end point of the sympathetic chain and is responsible for nociception and sympathetic innervation of the perineal region [ The coccygeal nerve is composed of the coccygeal plexus and is responsible for receiving sensation from the coccyx region. Upon exiting the sacral hiatus, the coccygeal nerves travel inferiorly, passing medial to the coccygeal cornu and laterally under the transverse process of the first coccygeal vertebra. The nerve follows a superficial course at this level [ There was limited literature data on coccygeal nerve block (CnB) [ The primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of CnB, a new method in the treatment of coccidynia, with GiB, an established method. Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of the interventions on the functionality score and to determine the adverse events associated with the interventions. This study was conducted as a randomised, controlled, and prospective trial. Ethics committee approval was obtained from the local hospital, and the Clinical Trial submission system was registered (Clinical Trial Number NCT06242587). This study was conducted in the single-center pain clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We used a computer-assisted randomisation program to categorise patients into groups. The other researcher as an independent statistician, unaffiliated with the enrollment of participants, produced the random allocation sequence. This sequence was retrieved through a secure system online. To maintain the integrity of allocation concealment, treatment assignments were enclosed in sealed, nontransparent envelopes. The interventions were performed by a physician with at least five years of experience in US and fluoroscopy (FL). The researcher who collected and analyzed the patients' pain and functionality scores did not know which patient received which intervention.  Participants The inclusion criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, coccydynia >3 months, unresponsive to conservative treatments (such as medication, sitting cushion, physiotherapy), and confirmation of the diagnosis of coccydynia by an MRI. The exclusion criteria included those with a secondary pathology detected by an MRI (malignancy, infection), pregnancy, presence of additional rheumatological diseases, L4-L5-S1 discopathy, diabetes mellitus, interventional procedures or for coccydynia in the last six months, and previous coccyx surgery. Interventions All procedures were performed without sedation, under local anaesthesia, and in sterile conditions. Patients were monitored according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) standards. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg for at least one minute or a drop of more than 20%-30% of MAP during the procedures was defined as hypotension and treated with intravenous crystalloids and vasopressors (usually ephedrine).  CnB Under US guidance, a CnB was performed in the intervention room. The patient was positioned prone and covered with a sterile drape. Using a 5-12 MHz linear US probe (LOGIQ P9, GE Ultrasound, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), the sacral cornuas and sacrococcygeal ligament were visualised. The transducer was then advanced 2-3 mm caudally to visualise the coccygeal cornuas. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were anaesthetised with 1% lidocaine using a 27-gauge needle. Using the in-plane technique, a 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted superomedial to the coccygeal cornu. Negative aspiration was confirmed before injecting 1 mL (4 mg) of dexamethasone (to prolong the duration of pain relief and for anti-inflammatory activity) and 1 mL (5 mg) of bupivacaine 0.5% for each nerve (8 mg dexamethasone and 10 mg bupivacaine total for each patient). Patients were monitored for possible complications for two hours after the procedure. Figure  A shows the ultrasound probe (red rectangle) positioned over the sacral cornu, while B shows the ultrasound image of the sacral cornu and the sacrococcygeal ligament at this probe position. C shows the ultrasound probe advanced caudally toward the coccygeal cornu, while D shows the ultrasound image of the coccygeal cornu at this probe position. E shows the position of the needle insertion relative to the ultrasound probe, while F shows the ultrasound image of the needle on the coccygeal horn. G shows the position of the needle insertion relative to the ultrasound probe, while H shows the possible position of the coccygeal nerve on the ultrasound image and the distribution of the administered drug. Red rectangle: Ultrasound probe GiB The GiB was performed in the operating room under FL guidance using a transcoccygeal approach. The patient was placed in the prone position, and the skin was sterilised and draped. The level of the procedure was determined using a lateral C-arm FL view. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were anaesthetised with 1% lidocaine using a 27-gauge needle. Once the target area was reached with a 22-gauge spinal needle, 2 cc of contrast medium (iohexol, 300 mg iodine/ml, GE Healthcare) was administered. Contrast agent was observed as a reverse coma sign, which is typical of an GiB. After negative aspiration, a total of 2 mL (8 mg) of dexamethasone, 2 mL (10 mg) of 0.5% bupivacaine, and 2 mL of saline were injected. Patients were monitored for side effects for two hours. Figure  A shows the needle passing through the intervertebral space to the anterior side of the coccyx for ganglion impar blockade, and B shows the appropriate contrast agent spread Outcome measurements The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate and compare the changes in pain intensity between CnB and GiB using the numerical rating scale (NRS) score. The NRS scale was used to assess pain intensity. Patients were shown a template with numbers ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain) and were asked to mark the intensity of their pain. The NRS scale was marked three times: before the procedure, four weeks after the procedure, and 12 weeks after the procedure. One of the secondary outcomes of this study was to analyse changes in the functional status of the patients using the PARIS functional questionnaire. This questionnaire includes self-administered questions about pain during various activities and assesses the relationship between pain and physical activity on a scale of 0 to 10. The questionnaire was completed by patients at the initial assessment and 12 weeks after the procedure. The other secondary outcome was the detection of adverse events related to the interventions. Statistical analyses and sample size All analyses were performed with the jamovi project version 2.3 (Released 2022; Jamovi, Computer Software, Sydney, Australia). The results of the study are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Normality analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, skewness-curvature, and histograms. Normally distributed variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. Numerical dependent variables were compared between groups using independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Repeated measures were analysed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Changes over time were compared using the Bonferroni correction. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sample size was based on primary outcomes and calculations performed with the G*Power version 3.1.9.4 software program (Released 2019; Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany) by taking an effect size 0.692, α = 0.05, power (1-β) = 0.90. A total of 37 individuals were reached for each group. Sencan et al.'s third-week NRS scores (mean and SD values) were obtained for this analysis [ In total, 118 patients with coccydynia were screened for eligibility. A total of 19 patients refused to participate in the study and 23 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 76 patients were randomised into CnB and GiB groups, with 38 patients in each group, and interventions were performed. After exclusion during the follow-up period, the study was completed with 30 patients in the CnB group and 26 in the GiB group. A patient flowchart is shown in Figure  There was no difference in age, sex, and aetiology between the two groups (Table  a: Independent sample T-test; b: Chi-square test; c: Mann-Whitney U test

There were no differences between baseline and week 12 scores between groups. When analysed within groups, the decrease in PARIS scores observed at week 12 was statistically significant (p < 0.001 for both groups) (Tables  During the treatment, two patients in Group CnB experienced numbness at the injection site, and one patient experienced hyperalgesia. In Group GiB, one patient had the needle tip advanced a little too far, but it did not cause rectal perforation. Antibiotic treatment was started prophylactically. Two patients experienced hypotension, and one patient had a transient increase in pain. Hypotension was mild and appropriately treated with crystalloid infusion without complications. These mild adverse events resolved spontaneously within 18 hours in both groups, with the longest lasting without the need for treatment. No major complications were observed with either intervention. This is the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided CnB at the level of the coccygeal cornuas in the treatment of coccydynia. After 12 weeks of follow-up, both GiB and CnB were found to have similar efficacy in reducing pain and improving function in patients with chronic coccydynia. Pericococcygeal injection, caudal epidural injection, and GiB are methods in persistent coccydynia. Injection content varies as a local anaesthetic, steroid, dextrose, and combinations [ Pericoccygeal injections can be considered a first-line injection method because they are minimally invasive and can be performed with a blind technique. This technique can be performed using US guidance or blind technique, but FL is rarely used. The injection site is typically located at the sacrococcygeal junction or most painful points. Conflicting data exists regarding its effectiveness [ Caudal epidural injection is another frequently used method. It can be performed with both FL and US (4). It is a more favourable option for patients with lower lumbar radicular pain accompanying coccydynia. In terms of efficacy, Sencan et al. compared GiB with caudal epidural steroid injection in the treatment of coccydynia and found that GiB was more effective [ Based on the available information, the GiB seems to be the most effective interventional procedure among those discussed above for coccydynia. The procedure can be performed using various approaches, including transcoccygeal and sacrococcygeal, and can also be guided by FL or US. Ghai et al. stated no complications in 15 patients who underwent GiB with US and reported US-guided intervention as a safe method. However, considering its close proximity to the rectum, we believe that FL-guided intervention is more reliable [ In 2021, two meta-analyses of coccydynia treatment were published by Andersen and Choudhary [ The coccygeal nerves arise from the coccygeal plexus and are responsible for pain sensation in this region. After emerging from the sacral hiatus, they become superficial as they follow a mediolateral course through the coccygeal cornuas. This superficial course makes it easy to reach the nerve with US [ Although Gruber et al. said that the coccygeal nerves can be reached above the sacral cornu by US, sometimes the coccygeal nerves are located between the sacrococcygeal ligament and the medial wall of the sacral cornu at this level [ Domingo-Rufes et al. described a US-guided block of the coccygeal nerves at the level of the sacral cornu. They visualised the sacral hiatus and the sacrococcygeal ligament with US and inserted the needle into the sacral canal along the medial edge of the sacral cornu using an out-of-plane approach. However, there is a risk of caudal epidural puncture if the needle tip passes the S2 level [ Recently, Wu et al. published a paper in which they blocked the coccygeal nerves at the level of the coccygeal cornu under US guidance in a case of coccydynia. In this article, it is stated that the nerve trapped in the medial part of the coccygeal cornu can be visualised with the US probe and is safe in terms of the risk of epidural puncture as the injection site is outside the sacral hiatus. After two local anaesthetic injections two weeks apart, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores decreased by more than 50% [ Following Wu's case report, Can et al. published an article with 32 patients [ In terms of side effects, although GiB is usually associated with minor side effects, serious side effects such as rectal perforation, cauda equina syndrome, and neuritis have been reported [ Regarding adverse events associated with coccygeal nerve procedures, paraesthesias and increased pain were reported in three patients in the study by Can et al. In the CnB group in our study, two patients developed paraesthesia and one patient developed hyperalgesia at the injection site, but no treatment was required. In terms of adverse events, we had only minor adverse events like Can et al. We had two complications requiring treatment in the GiB group, but all adverse events resolved spontaneously without treatment in the CnB group. The superiority of the CnB over the GiB was that it was performed under US guidance. The absence of radiation exposure is an advantage for both the practitioner and the patient. Although it is said that the GiB can also be performed with US, there is a serious risk of major complications. In addition, the superficial course of the coccygeal nerve means that it is sufficient to advance the needle tip about 1 cm during the procedure. This results in the patient experiencing less pain during the procedure. In our clinical practice, the CnB was easier to perform than the GiB. Our study had several limitations. First,, we could not evaluate the effect of interventions on analgesic consumption. Second, we could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments according to aetiologic perspectives. Third, we could not evaluate the effect of the interventions on the quality of life, mood, anxiety, and sleep quality. There are many invasive methods that can be used in patients with chronic coccydynia who do not respond to conservative treatment. However, nerve block at the level of the coccygeal cornu is a relatively new method. The present study is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of this new method. The results of this study do not provide evidence that GiB and CnB are superior to each other in terms of pain relief. The possible advantages of CnB include no radiation exposure, the site is far from the epidural space, no contrast is required, and it is easier to use because of the superficial course of the nerve. Further studies will increase our knowledge of the success of this method.","['coccydynia treatment', 'coccyx pain', 'fluoroscopy intervention', 'nerve block', 'peripheral nerve ultrasonography']",,Cureus,"""std"""
11466574,Financial development and environmental quality: Does the financial environmental Kuznets Curve Prevail in Australia?,"It is crucial to evaluate the link between financial development and environmental quality in order to meet the environmental sustainability goals. Therefore, this scholarly work seeks to validate the of an inverted U-shaped relationship between financial development and environmental quality in Australia, which modifies the conventional theory of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. For the purposes of empirical analysis, we utilized the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bound test over the period from 1980 to 2021 for empirical investigation. Our findings confirm the existence of a Financial Environmental Kuznets Curve (FEKC) in the long-run, while the short-run results do not support its establishment. This means that achieving a financial development level of 0.0458 could help attain the environmental wellbeing in Australia. Similarly, the estimation outcomes affirm that the conventional Environmental Kuznets Curve exists in the long-run but not in the short-run. Our results also indicate that energy usage negatively impacts environmental quality, while foreign direct investments support the pollution halo effect in the long-run but do not exhibit this effect in the short-run. The roles of urbanization and trade openness are positive in enhancing quality of environment in the short-run. However, the effect of the carbon tax on determining environmental quality in Australia is deemed insignificant. In conclusion, this study offers vital policy recommendations to help achieve the Australian government's commitment to climate change.","In recent years, growing concerns have arisen regarding the imperative need to address climate variability, rising global temperatures, and the biodiversity loss because of the detrimental pressure of human and economic activities on biosystems [ Primarily, the financial system is required to flow financial resources from surplus units to deficit units, facilitate payment systems, and provide other financial services [ The empirical takeaway of the linear relationship between FD and EQ has led to different interpretations of the relationship among variables. The first group of empirical discussions suggests that FD can affect EQ either positively or negatively [see e.g. [ In Australia, as the third-largest contributor to the economy, the financial sector holds 7.6 % of the industry share of output, Given the financial system's significance in aiding the transition to a carbon-neutral economy in Australia, this research primarily targets to validate the presence of the Financial Environmental Kuznets Curve (FEKC) for understanding the link between FD and EQ. Studying the FEKC contributes to economic theory by extending the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) to include the role of FD in shaping EQ. This integration provides a comprehensive understanding of development dynamics. Similarly, this study enriches the broader economic literature by linking multidimensional aspects of FD & EQ. Moreover, studying the inverted U-shaped relationship between FD and EQ is significant for informing environmental regulations. It helps policymakers balance FD and environmental sustainability by identifying specific stages where FD may harm the environment, thereby guiding targeted interventions. The novelty and uniqueness of this study is that its exploration of the existence of the FEKC in Australia as a country-specific analysis because the current consensus of an inverted U-shaped relationship between FD and EQ in Australia remains inconclusive due to the absence of country-specific studies in Australia. Additionally, this study focuses on addressing the overall aspects of FD, including the development of financial markets and financial institutions. The existing empirical studies usually model only a few selected aspects of FD, such as equity market capitalization, broad money supply, the International Monetary Fund's FD index, and domestic credit that measures financial access, depth, and efficiency, etc. Therefore, to a fill the existing gap, this study takes a integrated approach to include all components of the FD: financial access, financial depth, financial efficiency, and financial stability of financial markets and financial institutions, to measure their impact on EQ. Moreover, this study uses comprehensive measures to assess EQ. Unlike much of the existing evidence, which primarily relies on carbon emissions (CO After the introduction, the rest of the paper is structured as below: Section  The Kuznets curve took a new pathway in 1995, as it became the fundamental concept for discussing the economic-environmental nexus. Importantly [ The financial sector tends to pay less attention to EQ during the initial phase of economic growth [ The presence of FEKC is confirmed by [ Identically, [ Importantly, the study of [ This section discusses the methodological strategy, model construction, and data that is adopted and used to address and enhance the objectives of this study. As mentioned earlier, this research utilizes the EKC framework to understand the FD-EQ nexus in Australia. To reach the aim of the study, we replace the traditional EKC framework, using EQ measurements instead of Sulfur Dioxide used in the traditional EKC framework, and FD instead of GDP per capita. Following the studies of [ Additionally, based on the existing empirical works, we use economic growth, urbanization, energy use, foreign direct investments, and trade openness as control variables in the model. The theoretical ground for including economic growth as a control variable is based on the EKC framework of [ Additionally, energy consumption is included as one of the control variables because higher energy consumption signifies increased reliance on natural gas and fossil fuels, leading to raised levels of pollution and resource degradation [ The trade-environmental relationship is often discussed in terms of two possible ways: the impact of scale and the impact of composition. In the scale effect, trade facilitates economic advancement, leading to increased production and consumption, which, in turn, can negatively affect the environment [ Equation  More importantly, the enforcement of environmental policies, rules, and regulations has exerted a substantial influence on environmental quality and serves as an effective tool for controlling environmental pollution of the economy, while encouraging the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies and production processes [ Equation  At the outset, we perform a stationary test to determine whether the dataset is stationary, as this is a prerequisite for time series analysis. In this empirical work, we worked with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check for the unit root in the dataset. Mainly, we employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound test to empirically explore the presence of the FEKC in the Australian context. [ Following that, cointegration among the variables under investigation is assessed through bound testing, as detecting a long-term relationship between them enables the analysis of long-run coefficients. Subsequently, Long-run coefficients are tested. Next, the Error Correction Model (ECM) is used to capture how the model adjusts towards equilibrium, with the ECM model outlined in Equation  Cointegration between EQ and the predictors implies that there may be at least one-directional causality between these variables. Therefore, this study conducted a Granger causality test, following [ This study spans from 1980 to 2021, based on the availability of data, with most of the information being in annual intervals; this research is confined to annual data. The property of all pertinent data is time series and gathered from several secondary sources including the World Bank database, IMF database, and Bloomberg database.  Summary of variables, proxies utilized in the study. More importantly, in this study, FD is assessed using three proxies. In this context, we use the overall FD index provided by the IMF, the ratio of bank credit to bank deposits (%), and stock price volatility. The IMF's FD index encompasses the development of financial markets and financial institutions, including aspects of financial access, financial depth, and efficiency. Consequently, we employ rest of the proxies to quantify the financial stability of financial institutions and financial markets, respectively. Time series plots of FD proxies.

This positive effect can be traced back to the high consumption of fossil energy sources. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Australia ranks as the world's 10 Moreover, environmental regulation has a negative effect, and it is statistically insignificant, indicating that Australia's existing carbon tax scheme does not effectively impact to decrease GHG level. In contrast, the findings of [ The F-statistic from the short-run bound test is 6.8642, surpassing the upper limits, which confirms the existence of short-run cointegration among the analyzed variables and allows for the assessment of short-run estimates.

In this regard, FD in the economy plays a substantial role in improving EQ by guiding financial markets and financial institutions. This scholarly work aims on examining the link between FD and EQ in the Australian economy to bridge existing knowledge gaps in the research domain. Specifically, this research seeks to grasp the linkage between FD and EQ, which is recognized as the FEKC, by adopting the theoretical framework of the EKC. This study is unique compared to existing wisdom in this research domain because, to address the research gap, It takes into account all aspects of FD, such as financial depth, access, efficiency, and the stability of financial markets and institutions. The study covers the time frame from 1980 to 2021 based on the data availability. The main findings are outlined below: First, a long-term association among studied variables was found. In the long run, FD was observed an adverse effect on EQ. Additionally, the square term of FD exhibited a favorable impact on EQ, confirming an inverted U-shaped relationship between FD and EQ (known as the FEKC) in Australia. However, short-term results prove the non-existence of the FEKC. Moreover, the study established the EKC in the long run and reaffirmed similar results as the FEKC in the short run. Furthermore, energy consumption was found to negatively impact EQ. FDI validated the pollution halo effect in the long run while worsening EQ in the short run. Notably, the study found that the carbon tax played a neutral role in changing EQ in both the long run and the short run. Finally, in short run, trade openness and urbanization were shown to positively impact the improvement of the EQ of the Australian economy. According to the empirical results, several policy suggestions can be provided for policymakers in the Australian economy. Firstly, Australia's financial system should be strengthened to reduce present environmental pollution by channeling financial resources into sustainable investment avenues, such as green production and renewable energy generation. In this context, both financial markets and financial institutions should be reinforced to direct monetary resources toward investments that address environmental challenges. Regular monitoring of the financial flows within the financial system is essential. In addition, policymakers should focus on to the profit maximization objectives of financial intermediaries and participants in the financial system, especially since FD has a negative impact in its initial stages. Additionally, fostering environmental awareness among financial intermediaries, and investors shareholders, could help achieve the environmental targets set by the Australian government and benefit the entire community in the country. Importantly, policy implications should primarily be adaptive and dynamic to the different stages of FD in Australia. Mainly, policy implications should be more adaptive and dynamic to the different stages of the FD in Australia. Furthermore, policymakers should encourage highly polluting industries to implement environmentally friendly production processes, adopt innovative energy-efficient technologies, and allocate resources to renewable energy initiatives. Specifically, increasing the supply of renewable energy with providing monetary support to individuals and industries to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources, ultimately reducing pollution. Policymakers should also welcome ecologically friendly FDIs into the country and strengthen policies and regulations to mitigate their adverse effect in the short run. Regarding carbon tax, the study suggests that it does not significantly affect EQ in Australia. Therefore, policymakers should consider implementing and monitoring effective environmental regulations as a solid way forward without altering policy decisions or allowing subsidies to high-polluting industries to maintain political interests. Lastly, the key findings of this scholarly work can diliver as a guideline for other developed nations to regulate their financial systems to enhance EQ. This research gives valuable insights to validate the FEKC in Australia. But, it is necessary to emphasize that these results cannot be completely generalized to all advanced countries for policy implications due to different economic and financial settings. Therefore, comparative studies analyzing the validity of the FEKC in several advanced economies with diverse economic and financial contexts are essential. In this study, we were unable to include the ecological footprint, which evaluates human impact on the environment. Therefore, it is imperative to urge future researchers to incorporate the ecological footprint in order to assess EQ within the study context. Additionally, due to data limitations, we utilized two proxy variables to gauge the stability of the financial market and financial institutions. However, the proxies we employed cover the stability of stock markets and banking institutions only and exclude the stability of other markets, such as the insurance market. This emphasizes a need for future researchers to consider broader measures for capturing the financial stability of financial markets and institutions.

11466471,Non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction using a generative adversarial network for non‐coplanar radiotherapy,"To develop a non‐coplanar cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) image reconstruction method using projections within a limited angle range for non‐coplanar radiotherapy. A generative adversarial network (GAN) was utilized to reconstruct non‐coplanar CBCT images. Data from 40 patients with brain tumors and two head phantoms were used in this study. In the training stage, the generator of the GAN used coplanar CBCT and non‐coplanar projections as the input, and an encoder with a dual‐branch structure was utilized to extract features from the coplanar CBCT and non‐coplanar projections separately. Non‐coplanar CBCT images were then reconstructed using a decoder by combining the extracted features. To improve the reconstruction accuracy of the image details, the generator was adversarially trained using a patch‐based convolutional neural network as the discriminator. A newly designed joint loss was used to improve the global structure consistency rather than the conventional GAN loss. The proposed model was evaluated using data from eight patients and two phantoms at four couch angles (±45°, ±90°) that are most commonly used for brain non‐coplanar radiotherapy in our department. The reconstructed accuracy was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) and an overall registration error  In both patient data and phantom data studies, the qualitative and quantitative metrics results indicated that ± 45° couch angle models performed better than ±90° couch angle models and had statistical differences. In the patient data study, the mean RMSE and  The results show that the reconstructed non‐coplanar CBCT images can potentially enable intra‐treatment three‐dimensional position verification for non‐coplanar radiotherapy.","Non‐coplanar radiotherapy with couch rotation is commonly used in stereotactic radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy. Optical Surface Imaging (OSI) systems, such as Catalyst HD, Optical Surface Monitoring System, and so forth, are popularly used for patient position verification and monitoring, due to the following desirable characteristics: imaging without dose, real‐time monitoring, and so forth. However, some studies have also pointed out that there are some problems with the OSI system in verifying patients' positions. Owing to the possible collision of the gantry and treatment couch, it is challenging to apply CBCT to verify the patient's position in non‐coplanar situations. Previous studies have developed iterative methods to reconstruct CBCT images using limited‐angle projections. Zeng et al. Recently, owing to the outcomes of deep learning in computer vision and image processing, some studies have used deep learning for CBCT image reconstruction with limited‐angle projections. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction model, trained using coplanar CBCT as prior information and non‐coplanar limited‐angle projections to reconstruct high‐quality non‐coplanar CBCT images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction using deep learning. Forty patients with brain tumors were retrospectively included. One coplanar CBCT scan was acquired using the FDK algorithm configured in the onboard imaging system on a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) in full‐fan mode was acquired for each patient before initial treatment. The patient data, such as the ground truth and limited‐angle non‐coplanar projections, were simulated in the data preprocessing step. First, the coplanar CBCT image of each patient was rotated by the four couch angles listed in Table  The general information of couch angles, projection range, and projection numbers to simulate non‐coplanar radiotherapy. Two anthropomorphic head phantoms (Radiological Support Services, Long Beach, CA, USA) were used in this study (Figure  Two head phantoms were used for model evaluation.

 In this case,  In this study, 40 coplanar CBCT scans and 800 sets of non‐coplanar projections (40 patients, four couch angles, repeated five times) were included in the patient data set. In the phantom data set, two coplanar CBCT images (only the first coplanar CBCT images were used here) and 24 sets of non‐coplanar projections (two phantoms, four couch angles, repeated three times) were included. For network training, 80% of the patient data (data from 32 patients) were randomly selected as the training dataset, whereas the remaining 20% of the patient data and the phantom data were used as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the trained model based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The network was established with the Pytorch framework and trained with a workstation that has a CPU of Intel i9‐13900K, a GPU of NVIDIA RTX 4090, and 64 GB RAM. The learning rate for network training was initially set to be 0.002 and decreased by 30% for each epoch. The training was terminated if the mean square error between the synthetic DRR and DRR showed a variation below 5% for more than three epochs. The whole training process took 98 epochs, which lasted for approximately 3 days.

Table  The transform parameters (mean ± std) and overall registration error (mean ± std) between gCBCT and rCBCT of phantom testing data at four couch angles. In this study, we proposed a GAN model to reconstruct non‐coplanar CBCT images from coplanar CBCT images and non‐coplanar projections with a limited angle range for non‐coplanar radiotherapy. To the best of our acknowledge, this is the first study to reconstruct CBCT images in non‐coplanar situations using a deep‐learning model. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using both patient simulation data and realistic phantom data at four couch angles. The reconstructed image quality was evaluated according to our qualitative and quantitative analyses, as shown in Figures  As shown in Figures  For non‐coplanar radiotherapy, which often delivers higher fractional doses, couch rotation prolongs the setup time and increases the risk of movement during the treatment fraction. Although the proposed GAN model exhibits satisfactory results in non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction, there are still some limitations that must be noted. First, we only validated the performance of the phantom at four couch angles (±45° and ±90°) in this study. However, this model can be used for non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction at other couch angles. Others can modify the couch angle setting in the model to train their models according to their clinical needs and requirements. In addition, the proposed method can be potentially utilized for other treatment sites in non‐coplanar radiotherapy instead of being limited to brain cases. Second, each couch angle necessitates the training of a new GAN model, which inevitably increases the training costs. Training a model to handle arbitrary couch angles will be performed in our future studies. Third, the proposed model was not validated using data from actual patients, whose structures are more complex than those of the phantom. For clinical implementation, more clinical trials and clinical evaluations should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. There are several manually determined parameters in the loss function that need manual determination. For both  In this study, we have proposed a non‐coplanar CBCT image reconstruction method using a GAN model. With the newly designed joint loss, the generator can generate non‐coplanar images that maintain the consistency of the global structure. The proposed method makes intra‐treatment image guidance possible in non‐coplanar radiotherapy.

11466467,Standardization of scan protocols for RT CT simulator from different vendors using quantitative image quality technique,To investigate the feasibility of standardizing RT simulation CT scanner protocols between vendors using target‐based image quality (IQ) metrics. A systematic assessment process in phantom was developed to standardize clinical scan protocols for scanners from different vendors following these steps: (a) images were acquired by varying CTDI The level of change in the IQ ratio was significant (>0.6) when using IMR. The IQ ratio change was relatively low to moderate when using either iDose in CTp (0.1–0.5) or SAFIRE in CT It is possible to use target‐based IQ metrics to evaluate the performance of the system and operations across various scanners in a phantom. This can serve as an initial reference to convert clinical scanned protocols from one CT simulation scanner to another.,"Standardization of clinical computed tomography (CT) simulation imaging protocols is indispensable in the modern era of precision medicine. Consistent scanning practices in radiation oncology CT simulation optimize treatment planning by reducing variation in image quality (IQ) and minimizing noise in each scan, thereby, enhancing the confidence of dosimetrists in contouring regions of interest for the most personalized therapeutic approach. The objective of these tests is to provide quantitative system performance metrics in a standard CT water phantom. However, compared to conventional filter back projection (FBP) reconstruction, modern CT utilizes advanced non‐linear IR methods, such as statistics‐based IR, model‐based IR, and artificial intelligent (AI) IR. These IR models typically offer different level of strength that can be customized by end‐users. The noise power spectrum (NPS) measures noise properties, including the magnitude of noise and the spatial correlation of noise in the frequency domain (i.e., texture). It is a superior noise descriptor compared to noise magnitude. Task‐based measures of IQ were developed and introduced for CT performance assessment, including the object modulation transfer function (MTF) or task transfer function (TTF) and detectability index (d′). TTF and d′ were used to evaluate IQ of the deep learning reconstructed CT images compared to FBP or IR in phantom. In this study, a five‐step process was proposed to standardize clinical scan protocols for scanners from different vendors: (a) classify protocols into body and brain protocols, (b) obtain the rescaled NPS, (c) scan images by varying CTDI The clinical protocols implemented and applied in a Philips Big Bore RT CT scanner (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, herein referred to as CT Scan parameters used in brain and body protocols for this study in CT Reconstruction methods CT CT FBP;iDose4(1–5);IMR(1–3) FBP;SAFire(1–5) FBP;iDose4(1–6);IMR(1–3) FBP;SAFire(1–5) Water phantoms were scanned at the reference CTDI Figure  (a, left) CTP486 uniformity module with the overlaid ROIs; (b, middle) CTP404 module with seven sensitometry sample inserts; (c, right) CTP515 low contrast module, the 3rd diameter (blue) of the 1.0% supra‐slice was used in low contrast detectability (Section  The 2D NPS( The noise, measured as the standard deviation (SD) of the ROI in Hounsfield units (HU), and the magnitude of the NPS peak (NPS The scanned images of the CTP404 module of the Catphan phantom were analyzed to calculate the contrast and CNR for the seven sensitometry samples (Polystyrene, Acrylic, LDPE, Derlin, PMP, Air, and Teflon).

This study presented the overall effective CNR of all visible rods within the insert, calculated using the average composite image of all analyzed slices of the CTP404 module.

SAFIRE was better at low CTDI This study used quantitative IQ metrics recommended by TG 233 to compare the scanners from two manufacturers and develop a technique to standardize clinical CT simulation scan protocols. While the fundamental principles of CT image formation, including data acquisition, processing, and reconstruction algorithms, are consistent across CT systems, different manufacturers implement proprietary technologies that can lead to variability in the final IQ. Despite using similar acquisition techniques and reconstruction methods, the noise texture, spatial resolution, and overall image characteristics can differ across CT scanners from different vendors. These differences stem from the advanced automation and proprietary implementations of various aspects, such as data calibration, beam‐hardening correction, and image processing algorithms. As a result, there is no simple or straightforward way to match IQ across scanners, necessitating more nuanced methods to standardize and translate clinical CT simulation scan protocols between different CT systems. Since this study aimed to translate clinical scanned protocols between scanners from different manufacturers for RT simulation and treatment purposes, the tube potential (kV) was fixed at 120 kV. Additionally, the pitch, collimator, reconstruction kernel, and slice thickness were fixed separately for brain and body categories. This separation accounted for the differences in bowtie filter design and the reference CTDIvol definitions, which are specific to head (16 cm diameter) and body (32 cm diameter) imaging. As the study was conducted using phantoms with fixed diameters, ATC was not utilized. Instead, a range of CTDI In evaluating the IQ metrics at different clinical CTDI The weak (level 1−2) to moderate strength (3–4) of SAFIRE was close to the same hybrid statistical‐based IR of iDose (level 1−6). Each level increase in SAFIRE was close to two level increase at the iDose. In the stronger strength of SAFIRE (level 4−5), the magnitude of the IQ metrics change from FBP was similar to the magnitude of the IQ metric change at IMR. The using of the strong SAFIRE needs to be cautious if blotchy image was not desired. Interestingly, the contrast of various insert materials, ranging from low‐density acrylic to high‐density Teflon, remained consistent within the same protocol (body or brain) and was independent of CTDI This study did not utilize ATC evaluation. Instead, a range of clinical CTDI The Capthan phantom and ACR phantom consist of various modules designed for measuring IQ or evaluate task performance. Their standard geometry facilitates the adaptation of IQ metrics and Task functions by software, allowing for comprehensive testing under different scanned and reconstructed condition. While these tests are ideal for quantifying a CT scanner's system performance during the pre‐clinical phase, they are not suitable for accessing ATC performance. Clinical CT images, on the other hand, exhibit more complex material compositions and asymmetrical geometry, leading to various degree of beam hardening, softening, photon starvation effects that can impact image reconstruction performance and CT IQ. Evaluating CT IQ during the clinical phase is crucial for standardizing CT scan protocols. To address this, an automatic assessment algorithm was developed to evaluate CT IQ in Rando phantom and patient CT images, with the results of the evaluation being published separately.

11466375,"Risk of Clade II Mpox Associated with Intimate and Nonintimate Close Contact Among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Adults — United States, August 2022–July 2023",,"Monkeypox virus can spread through intimate or close contact with a person with mpox. Among men who have sex with men and transgender persons who reported close contact with a person with mpox, condomless receptive anal sex was associated with approximately five times the odds of mpox after controlling for mpox vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics, and concurrent close contact behaviors. The findings in this report underscore the importance of ongoing multifaceted mpox prevention activities, including mpox vaccination and education on safer sex practices, to reduce the spread of mpox. A global outbreak of clade II mpox associated with sexual contact, disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), has been ongoing since May 2022. Information on types of contact most associated with transmission is limited. This report used data from a multijurisdictional vaccine effectiveness case-control study of sexually active persons aged 18–49 years who identified as MSM or transgender, collected during August 2022–July 2023. Odds of mpox associated with selected types of intimate and nonintimate close contact with a person with mpox were estimated. Among 457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients who met minimum data requirements, 150 (32.8%) case-patients and 57 (5.5%) control patients reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Adjusted odds of mpox were 5.4 times as high among those who reported having condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox, compared with participants who reported close contact with a person with mpox and no condomless receptive anal sex with that person (OR = 5.4; p = 0.031). Although the mpox vaccine is highly effective, vaccination coverage remains low; a multifaceted approach to prevention remains important and should include vaccination promotion, safer sex practices, and increasing awareness that mpox continues to circulate. In May 2022, an unprecedented worldwide outbreak of clade II mpox, caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), was detected among persons in countries with no history of sustained community transmission. In the United States and worldwide, the ongoing outbreak has been associated with sexual contact, and has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) ( A secondary analysis was conducted using data previously collected for a vaccine effectiveness (VE) case-control study using patient self-reported survey data and jurisdiction-reported data from 12 U.S. jurisdictions ( Case- and control patients were eligible to participate if they were sexually active, The analytic sample was restricted to case- and control patients from the VE study who reported close contact with a person with mpox. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted odds of select types of intimate and nonintimate contact and case- or control patient status. The unadjusted models examined demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender identity), a composite variable of HIV status and HIV PrEP or treatment (i.e., antiretroviral [ARV]) use and adherence, presence of immunocompromising conditions or medications, Among the 1,487 eligible survey respondents from the VE study (457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients), 207 (13.9%; 150 case-patients and 57 control patients) reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Compared with control patients, case-patients were slightly older (aged 35.5 years versus 33 years) and had fewer recent sexual partners (two versus three) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** P-values comparing the percentage of case-patients to control patients by sociodemographic and health categories were calculated using Pearson’s chi-square test. P-values for continuous variables were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. *** HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. **** Symptoms consistent with mpox included rash or skin lesions, fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. In the unadjusted models, behaviors associated with increased odds of mpox among persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox included condomless receptive anal sex (OR = 3.2; p = 0.006), condomless insertive anal sex (OR = 2.8; p = 0.009), receiving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.7; p = 0.006), giving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.0; p = 0.046), and sharing towels, bedding, or clothing (OR = 2.3; p = 0.034) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** HIV PrEP use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who did not report living with HIV. HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. Numerous studies have identified sexual contact as the primary risk factor for mpox; however, few have examined risk associated with specific intimate and nonintimate close contact behaviors. In this study, data from a previously conducted case-control study were analyzed to estimate the odds of mpox associated with selected intimate and nonintimate behaviors among MSM and transgender persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox. Condomless sex, including anal sex and oral sex, was associated with increased odds of mpox, as was sharing towels, bedding, and clothing. After adjusting for measured confounders, including mpox vaccination and concurrent close contact behaviors, condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox remained associated with increased odds of mpox. Although condoms might reduce MPXV exposure at anogenital or oral mucosal sites, condoms alone might not prevent all exposures to MPXV because rash can occur on other parts of the body and transmission can occur through other routes, including saliva and respiratory secretions ( As clade II mpox continues to circulate in the United States, mpox mitigation activities remain critical ( Studies from areas with endemic mpox and during the ongoing 2022 global outbreak have identified contaminated household items such as linens and utensils as potential, albeit less common, MPXV transmission routes ( The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, selection bias is likely because survey participation was voluntary and recruitment for control patients occurred in sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinics. Differences in sexual risk-taking behaviors might exist between those who participated in the survey and those who did not and between persons who did and did not seek health care. Second, survey data were self-reported and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias, particularly because of the sensitive nature of some of the questions regarding sexual behaviors, and because the time between index event and survey completion varied. Third, intimate contact and sexual behavior variables were limited to a few broad measures in this study and do not account for potentially important factors such as frequency and duration of contact, partner type, group sex, substance use, or impact of sexual networks, all of which might affect risk for mpox transmission. Fourth, <15% of survey participants reported close contact with a person with mpox; because of this small sample size, the analysis might be underpowered to detect associations with behaviors that were less commonly reported. Finally, although the 12 U.S. jurisdictions included in this study covered a broad geographic area, data might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. The mpox vaccine is highly effective, and clinicians should continue to promote vaccination among eligible persons.",[],2024-10-10,Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,"""std"""
11468863,Methamphetamine abuse impairs sequential working memory,"The ability to maintain and manipulate sequential information in working memory, referred to as sequential working memory, plays a vital role in our daily life. While research has shown that methamphetamine abuse affects the neural substrates and the overall functioning of working memory, its specific impact on sequential working memory remains unclear. In this study, we asked 62 abstinent methamphetamine-dependent participants and 59 control participants to complete a digit ordering task in which they saw four digits one-by-one over time and subsequently rearranged them in ascending order. The four digits were presented either randomly in the experimental condition or in ascending order in the control condition. Results show that methamphetamine-dependent participants performed worse than the controls in the experimental condition in which sequential working memory was needed to complete the task, but not in the control condition in which only short-term memory was needed. This finding demonstrates that methamphetamine abuse impairs sequential working memory.","Methamphetamine is a potent stimulant that exerts significant effects on the central nervous system. It has been found that the abuse of methamphetamine can lead to significant and enduring neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in individuals ( Indeed, extensive evidence documents impairments of working memory by methamphetamine abuse, in the n-back task, digit span task, delayed match to sample task, spatial working memory task, among others ( Sequential working memory refers to the ability to maintain and manipulate the order of items in working memory, a function that differs from the mere storage of information (i.e., short-term memory) related to individual items, such as their identity, pattern, or color. This ability is essential for various cognitive processes, encompassing verbal activities such as speech perception and spelling, as well as nonverbal activities like planning and goal-directed behavior ( Two earlier studies employing a sequential working memory task, however, failed to yield findings supporting this hypothesis ( In the current study, a substantial number of participants were examined using an enhanced sequential working memory task. During this task, participants were presented with four unique numerical digits in sequence and subsequently required to recall the digits in ascending order following a delay. Crucially, the digits presented were either in a random order or in ascending order. The former condition requires participants to re-order the digits in working memory, while the latter does not ( We enrolled 62 abstinent individuals dependent on methamphetamine (32 females, M_age=27.3 ± 4.2 years, M_education=9.4 ± 1.5 years) who met the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder according to the DSM-5 ( Participants’ demographic information and methamphetamine use characteristics. It is important to acknowledge that the control group comprised individuals who were older (95% CI of age difference = [6.47, 10.14], p < 0.001) and had received a higher level of education (95% CI of education difference = [0.24, 1.33], p < 0.01) than the methamphetamine group. In China, individuals with addictive behaviors typically have lower age and educational levels. However, due to the development of the education sector in China, there are not many people in the local community who match the methamphetamine group in both age and educational level. If we insist on using an age-matched control group, it will increase the educational level disparity between the two groups, while using an education-matched control group will increase the age disparity between the two groups. Ultimately, we relaxed the age restrictions during participant recruitment to ensure that the differences in age and educational level between the two groups were not too large. In the subsequent statistical analyses, we controlled for the differences in age and educational level between the two groups. The experimental procedure was programmed using E-Prime 3.0 and conducted on a 17-inch laptop computer (screen resolution: 2240x1400, 60.02 Hz). Participants were brought into a standardized behavioral laboratory in batches, ensuring no communication or interaction among them to prevent any mutual interference. Each participant sat facing the computer, with a distance of 60 cm between their head and the computer screen. The experiment contained two blocks of stimuli, each containing 31 trials (15 ordered trials, 16 random trials). In each trial, participants were presented with four distinct digits, written in Chinese characters, sequentially at one digit per second ( Task structure: The task included interleaved random and ordered conditions. In each trial, participants were presented with four distinct Chinese characters representing numbers one by one. They were required to remember the order of these numbers based on their magnitudes. In the ordered condition, the numbers appeared in ascending order, while in the random condition, the numbers were presented in a random order. After the delay, participants had to judge whether the hollow dot indicated the target position of the digit probe by pressing buttons with the right hand. In the Ordered condition, the numerical order of the digits was inherently clear and only short-term memory was needed to store the digits. In the Random condition, participants needed to rearrange the digits in memory before reporting them in numerical order. The comparison between the Random and Ordered conditions served to isolate sequential working memory manipulation. Trials with a reaction time (RT) shorter than 0.2 seconds or longer than 5 seconds were excluded from data analysis. A total of 29 trials (15 in the Methamphetamine Group), representing approximately 0.38% of the initial 7502 trials, were excluded from the analysis. The RTs and response accuracy were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. For the fixed effects, we included condition, group, and their interaction. For the random effects, we included a random intercept and a random slope for condition, for each participant. To control for the effects of age and level of education, we included them as covariates in the models. All data analyses were conducted using the stats models package ( For accuracy data, the main effects of participant group (Coef=0.042, SE=0.03, p=0.16) and experimental condition (Coef=-0.031, SE=0.024, p=0.192) were insignificant. The interaction was significant (Coef=-0.11, SE=0.033, p=0.001). A simple effects test revealed that methamphetamine-dependent participants performed worse than the control group in the Random condition (F(1,119)=6.57,p< 0.05), but not in the Ordered condition (F(1,119)=0.35,p= 0.55). Notably, neither age (Coef=0.003, SE=0.002, p=0.201) nor level of education (Coef=0.009, SE=0.008, p=0.268) had significant effects.  Task accuracy for each participant across conditions. The dashed line represents chance level, and each point represents one participant. For RTs, although the main effect of experimental condition was significant (Coef=0.049, SE=0.024, p=0.04), neither the main effect of participant group (Coef=0.043, SE=0.097, p=0.658) nor the interaction between group and the condition (Coef=0.005, SE=0.033, p=0.884) reached significance. Similar to the accuracy data, age (Coef=-0.003, SE=0.007, p=0.645) and level of education (Coef=-0.002, SE=0.025, p=0.933) had no significant effect on RTs.  Average reaction time for each participant across conditions. Each point represents one participant. In this study, the impact of methamphetamine abuse on sequential working memory function was investigated by applying a sequential working memory task to 62 individuals with methamphetamine dependence and 59 healthy controls. Results showed that individuals dependent on methamphetamine exhibited lower performance compared to the controls in the Random condition but not in the Ordered condition. This finding provides evidence for the hypothesis that methamphetamine abuse impairs the functioning of sequential working memory. The present finding not only complete previous studies on the impact of methamphetamine abuse on working memory but also provide explanatory insights into the impact of methamphetamine on cognitive processes involving sequential information. Two previous studies have tested methamphetamine-dependent participants and normal controls with a behavior assessment kit covering a list of activities such as comprehension and planning, financial ability, communication skills, transportation, household skills, and medication management ( Although the neural mechanism of the impaired sequential working memory was not the target of the current study, integrating the present finding with those on patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) nevertheless allow us to gain valuable insights into this issue. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, resulting in the loss of dopamine primarily in the basal ganglia ( In conclusion, by employing a task tailored to isolate the functioning of sequential working memory and by testing a relatively large pool of participants with methamphetamine abuse, the current study demonstrates (again) that methamphetamine abuse has profound impacts on diverse aspects of working memory, including the sequential processing of information that has not been examined in previous studies.","['working memory', 'sequential working memory', 'cognitive deficits', 'methamphetamine dependence', 'digit ordering task']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Psychiatry,"""sti"""
11468210,Barriers and facilitators to women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services in rural Australia: a systematic review,"Accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in rural Australia presents complex challenges that negatively impact women’s health and exacerbate health inequities across the life course. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the barriers and facilitators to women’s access to SRH services in rural Australia, considering both supply and demand dimensions. We systematically searched peer-reviewed literature published between 2013 and 2023. Search terms were derived from three major topics: (1) women living in rural Australia; (2) spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and (3) barriers or facilitators. We adopted the “best fit” approach to framework synthesis using the patient-centred access to healthcare model. Database searches retrieved 1,024 unique records, with 50 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed access to primary care services ( This review highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SRH service access disparities in rural Australia. Understanding the barriers and facilitators women face in accessing SRH services within the rural context is necessary to develop comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions informed by a nuanced understanding of rural women’s diverse needs. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11710-9.","Access to healthcare is a multifaceted indicator of healthcare system performance and equitable care provision [ Access is a complex concept, defined in spatial and aspatial terms [ 
 Patient-centred access to healthcare dimensions and determinants. (Adapted from Levesque et al. 2013 conceptual framework) [ Australia’s inequitable distribution of health services is well documented, and issues associated with access are often influenced by Australia’s vast landmass, challenging geographic environments, and sparsely distributed populations in rural areas [ Previous reviews have focused on specific types of SRH services, such as abortion services [ This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ The PICOS mnemonic was used to frame the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table

A comprehensive list of search terms was developed from a preliminary search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and a review of relevant literature, such as SRH systematic reviews. The keywords in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used to index articles were utilised to develop the full search strategy. A combination of search terms related to the following concepts: [1] women living in rural, regional, or remote Australia; [2] spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and [3] barriers or facilitators to access. A supplementary file outlines the complete search strategies (see Supplementary file  All identified citations were collated and uploaded into Endnote (Version 20.2.1, Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA). Citations were then imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were dual-screened in Covidence by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC) using the prespecified eligibility criteria. Potentially relevant studies were retrieved as full texts and dual-assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage were recorded. Reference lists of included studies were screened for additional studies. Any reviewer disagreements during the selection process were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies by SW using Excel and tabulated with the following headings: author, year, health service setting, health discipline, context, geographic location according to MMM or ASGS-RA, population characteristics, study objective, study design, barriers, facilitators, summary of findings, study limitations, and implications. Ten per cent of the extracted data were cross-checked by another reviewer (LA). Any reviewer disagreements were resolved through discussion or with an additional reviewer. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for the appropriate study design (e.g., analytical cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, cohort studies) [ Study characteristics (e.g., barriers or facilitators, SRH service) were tabulated and synthesised narratively to describe the available evidence.

 Summary table of included articles ( Staff from community-based non-government Women’s Health Centres ( Rural women who had an abortion in the last 15 years ( General practice Maternity care Clinicians ( Aboriginal women ( Healthcare consumer Healthcare provider Indigenous girls ( Health professionals ( The highest proportion of studies were conducted in New South Wales (NSW) ( The highest proportion of studies were focused on maternity care settings ( Key barriers and facilitators are presented under the five dimensions of the patient-centred access to healthcare model (Fig.  Approachability represents the capacity of a health system to provide services so that women with health needs can identify and reach them [ Three main barriers were identified for approachability: insufficient information, fragmented healthcare pathways, and limited internet access. Insufficient information primarily related to gaps in the information provided by GPs around maternity care providers [ Three main barriers emerged related to women’s ability to perceive healthcare: low health literacy, limited awareness, and difficulties in navigating the health system. The barrier of low health literacy was predominantly related to cervical screening [ Two main facilitators were identified for approachability: health system improvements and enhanced education and institutional approaches. Health system improvements pertained to changes to the health system, such as providing culturally accessible information and roles for Aboriginal Health Practitioners (AHP) to work with the community and coordinate access to screening services [ Three facilitators were identified for women’s ability to perceive healthcare: information access, knowledge and awareness, and culturally appropriate information. Information access was primarily related to internet access, as this was the most common way women accessed information, and ease of access to information determined the choice of provider [ Acceptability relates to cultural and social factors that affect a woman’s ability to accept or seek health services or aspects of them. For example, the gender or social group of the provider or the beliefs associated with systems of medicine may reduce the acceptability of seeking care [ Three primary barriers were identified for acceptability: negative provider attitudes, low-quality care, and privacy concerns. Negative provider attitudes were frequently reported by women and included GPs’ unwillingness to refer for abortion services or denying care altogether, leaving women needing to locate willing providers themselves [ Three barriers were identified for women’s ability to seek healthcare: lack of cultural safety, stigma, embarrassment and perceived judgment, and community context challenges. Lack of cultural safety primarily affected maternity care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, whereby standard maternity care was not deemed culturally safe, with limited cross-cultural understanding of medical care [ Three facilitators were identified for acceptability: inclusive and culturally sensitive practices, enhanced privacy with flexible service delivery, and improved health system practices. Culturally sensitive practices involved ensuring cultural safety and consulting women on their cultural needs around birth [ The main facilitator for women’s ability to seek healthcare was related to care preferences. Birthing in the local community was reported to be a positive experience for women [ Availability and accommodation refer to the ability to access health services and healthcare providers, both physically and promptly. Availability means enough health resources to provide services, including the providers’ characteristics (e.g., presence of the health professional, qualification) and how services are delivered [ Three barriers were identified for availability and accommodation: poor local access, inadequate health service availability, and limited provider availability. Poor local access was related to the lack of and fragmented local services. For example, ultrasound or pathology services were not available at the same location as the care provider, requiring patients to travel [ Three barriers were identified that impacted a woman’s ability to reach healthcare: transportation issues, increased travel, and relocation for care. Transportation issues were particularly relevant for women without a driving licence or car, as they had to depend on public transportation or family and friends [ Facilitators identified for availability and accommodation encompassed the enhancement of local service provision and capacity, and increased resource accessibility. Strategies to enhance local service provision and capacity involved increasing their capacity [ One facilitator was identified for women’s ability to reach healthcare: time and travel efficiency. This was related to telehealth appointments [ Affordability pertains to a woman’s economic ability to allocate resources and time to necessary health services. The direct costs of services, related expenses, and the potential loss of income influence it. Affordability can differ based on the type of service and relies on the ability to acquire the resources needed to cover care costs [ Two primary barriers to affordability were identified: high direct costs and costs associated with essential products. The high direct costs identified across multiple studies included limited bulk-billing options [ Two barriers were found to hinder a woman’s ability to pay for healthcare: high travel-related costs and the financial burden of indirect costs. High travel-related costs were reported in four studies for women who were required to travel for care [ Two facilitators emerged for affordability, including cost reduction strategies, and policy and incentive support. Cost reduction strategies involved the increased use of telehealth services due to lower associated costs [ Service affordability was identified as a facilitator for women’s ability to pay for healthcare. Improving access and availability of MToP appointments and medication in rural areas was found to be much more affordable than accessing SToP [ Appropriateness refers to the overall clinical benefit for the woman and whether the expected health benefits (e.g., improved quality of life) outweigh the potential negative consequences (e.g., time, cost). Appropriateness also includes adequacy, which pertains to the quality of the type and model of services provided and their continuity [ Two barriers were found for appropriateness: limitations in telehealth accessibility and care discontinuities. The limitations in telehealth accessibility were linked to language barriers for non-English speaking women and the absence of visual cues for the visually impaired [ Two barriers were also identified for women’s ability to engage in healthcare, including a lack of support systems and psychological effects. Lack of support systems pertained to women who were required to relocate to give birth. Women who relocated experienced disconnection and distress from leaving family support and also reported inadequate caregiver support for existing children [ Two facilitators were identified for appropriateness, including telehealth accessibility and patient-centred care. One study found that the accessibility of telehealth helped to promote relationship-building with a provider before the patient was required to travel [ Thirty-nine studies (78%) were assessed using the JBI quality appraisal tool for qualitative design, while sixteen studies (32%) were evaluated using the JBI quality appraisal tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. A supplementary file includes the quality appraisal for all studies (see Supplementary file  To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesise the evidence on the spatial and aspatial barriers and facilitators that women experience in accessing SRH services in rural healthcare settings in Australia. This review highlighted significant barriers and facilitators from supply and demand access dimensions. Many of the facilitators to SRH access identified in this review relate to women’s empowerment. Empowerment refers to the ability of women to make choices and exercise agency and decision-making through expanded access to and control over resources and changes to the institutional structures that affect their lives [ Health literacy can contribute to women’s empowerment and agency by giving them the tools to access, understand, and use health information to participate in shared decision-making, which is essential for enabling patient-centred care [ Patient-centred care was a facilitator identified in the appropriateness and ability to engage dimension. Continuity of carer was identified as a significant factor in access to maternity care, also highlighted in other systematic reviews of access to antenatal care in high-income countries [ Despite emphasising patient-centred care, negative provider attitudes pose significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly accessing abortion care in rural areas. A recent scoping review highlighted the relationship between negative attitudes, abortion stigma and quality of care, contributing to the gatekeeping and obstruction of abortion access [ In addition to addressing negative provider attitudes, it is crucial to acknowledge the affordability and ability to pay dimension, as the financial barriers further hinder access to essential SRH services for women in rural areas. Some women in the included studies reported a lack of information and difficulties accessing financial incentives for maternity care relocation, such as Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) [ Healthcare expenses paid directly by individuals in Australia comprise 17 per cent of the country’s healthcare expenditures [ Beyond the immediate health implications, it is essential to recognise the broader societal benefits associated with improving access to SRH services in rural communities. Addressing the barriers to accessing SRH services in rural areas holds wider societal benefits, including economic and social outcomes [ Considering the critical need to address barriers to SRH access in rural Australia, policymakers must prioritise targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility. First, there is a pressing need for health service redesign and interventions prioritising women’s empowerment and control over their health. Further research across different states, particularly those with significant rural populations (e.g., Western Australia), is essential to capture the diverse needs of these communities and ensure patient-centred care. This includes the prioritisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s voices in developing culturally safe antenatal care models and addressing barriers to antenatal and birthing care, especially in rural and remote Australia. Further, there needs to be a consistent use of geographic classification systems relevant to policy in rural research to facilitate decision-making from findings [ A strength of this systematic review is the use of rigorous and robust methods to identify, appraise and synthesise the literature pertaining to the barriers and facilitators to spatial and aspatial access to women’s SRH services in rural Australian healthcare settings. In particular, the comprehensive search and selection process identified a large number of included studies published in the last ten years. This review builds on existing evidence to understand health service accessibility in Australia [ Identifying the barriers and facilitators for women in accessing essential SRH services within the rural context is a necessary step for the development of comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions that address the diverse needs of rural women. Our study supports the need for targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility in rural areas. These include a comprehensive review of Medicare rebates and PBS subsidised items to enhance affordability and accessibility to SRH care, investment in digital healthcare infrastructure, and health service redesign prioritising co-design and a person-centred approach to ensure the service meets the needs of rural women. Further research is required to target the access barriers to SRH services and address the disparities in health service distribution and health inequity in rural Australia.

11467999,8th Public Health Palliative Care International Conference: Building Bridges between Science and People,,"
 
 
 Dear Colleagues Dear Friends It brings me immense joy to extend a warm welcome to every one of you to the 8th Public Health Palliative Care International Conference in Bern, the cozy and beautiful capital city of Switzerland. We invite you to experience the charms of Bern, an ancient city at the gateway to the breath-taking high mountains of the Alps. Two years ago, we met in Bruges, Belgium, for the 7th PHPCI conference and experienced there a fantastic conference embedded in the Compassionate City of Bruges. Next to the conference program, we had the exciting artistic track and during the conference week, the Compassionate City was organizing the city festival, embracing several local initiatives on the themes of serious illness, long-term care, mourning and loss. I am very pleased that we can offer you this year an equally interesting and exciting conference in Bern. During the conference week, several activities and events will be hold in the City of Bern, in collaboration with the Compassionate City Bern. The scientific and cultural programs have been carefully prepared by the committees and this gathering promises to showcase the many aspects of public health palliative care from all over the world. The cultural engagement with the City of Bern provides an opportunity to see how the civic, social and healthcare worlds can partner to support compassionate communities and compassionate cities. This conference promises to be an extraordinary gathering, showcasing the pinnacle of progress in public health palliative care, a practice and research domain that is rapidly evolving. Addressing the complex needs of the seriously ill, death, dying, loss and bereavement requires collaboration across professional groups and disciplines. Let us embark together on a journey to identify and engage researchers and practice experts in public health palliative care, fostering creativity and innovation. We encourage each of you to take full advantage of this unique opportunity at the conference to connect with fellow attendees both within and beyond the confines of our conference venue. It is my fervent hope that the conversations, insights, and knowledge gained during this conference will galvanize public health palliative care worldwide, charting a course toward a brighter future for all those in need of compassionate care. I extend my profound gratitude to the members of the preparatory committees (Organizing Committee, Scientific Committee, Committee of the City Programme, Committee of the German-Speaking Countries, Committee of the Swiss Programme) and to all volunteers for curating an exceptional program, rich in content and relevance. All names of people involved in these committees can be found on the conference website ( Lastly, I extend my deepest appreciation to each one of you for your commitment to public health palliative care. Your presence at the 8th PHPCI Conference in Bern is a testament to your dedication, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to engage with you in stimulating discussions and meaningful interactions at the conference. On behalf of the Council of PHPCI, I wish you all a stimulating and engaging conference. 
 Luc Deliens, president of PHPCI On behalf of the scientific committee of the 8th World Congress of Public Health Palliative Care International, PHPCI 2024 in Bern we warmly welcome you from across the world to this beautiful and historic city. We wish to acknowledge and thank the outstanding contributions from delegates across the world, and to our highly motivated scientific committee representing all continents. We are pleased to present this stimulating conference abstract book to you. More than ever, the topics of dying, caregiving, and grieving represent pressing and urgent challenges across all societies: an end of life in dignity is far from guaranteed and the necessary confidence, capacity, and resource are dramatically lacking across the world. This is why research, practice, and support must raise its voice and become political – drawing on evidence, and united in a will for change. As highlighted in recent landmark papers, we realize the enormous challenges for the near future: the increasing number of people in need for support until death, the worldwide injustice in access to high quality health care, the need to recognise and respond to the wider determinants of living and dying well, the decreasing number of professionals entering or staying in their job, and the lack of a political will to develop skills and confidence for caring for each other in solidarity. But hope is in the air: this abstract book showcases many initiatives and projects that demonstrate that the creativity and conviction in how we connect with each other at the end of life reflects the level of mutual respect across the whole life course. We are convinced that this conference will mark the beginning of many new ideas not only on paper, but in reality. Through ‘Building Bridges’, the conference’s theme, we hope that everyone will be moved to shift the current status quo through the connection with others. Building bridges within and across the communities we are part of. Even if small in size compared to the dimensions of the global challenges before us, the sheer number and potential of the presented projects offer a unique opportunity to stay optimistic: compassion is the essence for our global survival.

 University of Manchester, United Kingdom The aim of my research was to offer an authentic personal narrative of what matters to people at the end of their lives. I sought to attend to death as an integral life experience that brings about distinct and meaningful connotations of selfhood and identity. Principally, I sought to understand how (or if) the social construction of gender, and social difference more broadly, is important to our end-of-life experiences and wishes. To attend to the nuances of experience in death and dying, I adopted an ethnographic people-centered approach with a series of semi-structured interviews which held a loose structure of questions but prioritised storytelling and participant-led interview direction. One of the most pivotal findings of my study were that death had a catalytic effect on gender identities. My research found that gender had a cognitive role in experiencing and talking about death whereby the differential social roles of women and men proliferate at end of life. This substantiated the analytical standpoint for the study’s findings; summarised as: 1. People pre-empt their end-of-life considerations through their understanding of their gender. Notably, my female participants all fixated on the notion of the ‘altruistic caregiver’ as explanatory of their end-of-life wishes whilst the men were deeply engaged in the finances and ‘overseeing’ of the family as their priority. 2. Gender foregrounded the justification of people’s thoughts and experiences of death through the primacy of their identification of women and men. My participants expressed worries about their death as bounded by their understanding of their own gendered expectations of duty of care for others in their family; largely their children or spouses. 3. Death can reaffirm or challenge gender and its’ animations; but this is not linear. Gender knowledges and identities can be equally complicated by our reflections on death, which was exemplified by the men who I interviewed that each experienced a sense of renegotiation in their gender identity through their personal experiences of death. In turn, this changed the way they both felt and experienced emotion. My research demonstrates the crucial need for future research on death, dying, and gender whilst indicating the pivotal differential priorities which matter to people at the end of their lives. Further, my findings offer a complicated perspective on the differential support needed for men and women in end-of-life conversations.

 In analyzing the data, Statistical Analysis will be employed using Pearson R vs. Spearman rank correlation coefficient which is still subject for assumptions testing for the quantitative phase. Whereas, thematic analysis will be used to analyze the narrations of the primary caregivers’ lived experiences. Finally, integration technique of connecting and developing joint analysis will also be employed prior to the second phase of data collection. This integration technique will be used from the quantitative phase to inform and link to subsequent data collection for the qualitative phase. Mixed-method meta-inferences will also be drawn to show if the results from the quantitative phase are confirmed, discordant, or expanded from the themes created from the qualitative phase. 
 
 Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Wider social networks are increasingly recognised in supporting people with care needs. Health promoting initiatives around the end of life aim to foster these social connections but currently provide little insight into how willing people are to help neighbours facing support needs. This study describes how willing people are to help neighbours who need support practically or emotionally, whether there is a difference in willingness depending on the type of support needed, and what determines this willingness. We applied a cross-sectional survey design and distributed 4,400 questionnaires to a random sample of people aged >15 across four municipalities in Flanders, Belgium. These surveys included attitudinal and experiential questions related to serious illness, caregiving and dying. Respondents rated their willingness (scale 1-5) to provide support to different neighbours in hypothetical scenarios: (1) an older person in need of assistance and (2) a caregiver of a dying partner. A total of 2,008 questionnaires were returned (45.6%). Average willingness to support neighbours was 3.41 (case 1) and 3.85 (case 2). Helping with groceries scored highest; cooking and keeping company lowest. Factors associated with higher willingness included optimistic outlook about receiving support from others, family caregiving experience, and prior volunteering around serious illness or dying. People are generally willing to support their neighbours who need help practically or emotionally, especially when they have prior experience around illness, death or dying. This suggests a potentially large informal support network which is available to all. Initiatives promoting social connection and cohesion around serious illness, caregiving and dying may harness this potential through experiential learning.

 In collaboration with a locally based secondary school in 2007, the idea for a project day for senior pupils on dealing with dying, death and bereavement was born. The objective was to establish a secure space beyond academic demands, encouraging open communication and the development of coping strategies for adolescents. This initiative supports young people in engaging thoughts on “dying, death and bereavement” while offering guidance without overwhelming them. It empowers adolescents to address emotional needs, fostering openness on this challenging topic and promoting self-help through intuitive competencies, self-worth and personal coping strategies. In 2012, an expert symposium led to the creation of a handbook for teachers and hospice workers. The second symposium in 2013 shaped a curriculum for training teachers and hospice workers as multipliers. Since 2015, nationwide seminars have trained nearly 500 multipliers, implementing the project in different school forms, supporting pupils in addressing “Dying, Death, and Bereavement.” 
 
 Uniklinik Köln The first focus group revealed a special role for hospice volunteers. They are neither part of the family system nor of the full-time care, they contribute a lot of time and have no therapeutic mandate. Hospice volunteers wish for training courses that focus on their special position, to use language that was understandable to laypeople and preferred face-to-face to online formats. For relatives, it emerged that, on the one hand, it is important to reflect who really has a desire to die and specifically for whom. In addition, relatives experience particular burdens that result in their own need for support. They wish for short online information and exchange formats in which desire to die could be discussed as neutrally as possible. Based on these results, the existing training program was adapted for hospice volunteers and a digital two-hour format for relatives was developed, piloted, and evaluated.

 The 2015 Quality of Death Index has listed the Philippines, out of 80 countries, as one of the worst places to die. The country scored poorly regarding the quality of end-of-life care available. In December 2015, the Department of Health (DOH) issued an Administrative Order, the “National Policy for Palliative and Hospice Care in the Philippines.” In November 2023, the Department of Health (DOH), in partnership with Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital (JBLMGH), led the development of the first Philippine Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on palliative and end-of-life care (PEOL) for adult patients with cancer. This local CPG will be used for policy and benefit package development and disseminated widely through various channels.

 NSW Health, Australia Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations experience several barriers in accessing palliative care supports and services. Common barriers, including language, health literacy and differences in beliefs around death and dying, impact experiences of care and can often result in underutilisation of palliative care supports and services. This is especially relevant for the South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) in Sydney, Australia, where 68% of families speak a language other than English at home, and more than half its residents (52.7%) born overseas, compared to the 33% national average. This project aimed to use a community-based approach to increase dialogue about palliative care, including death and dying matters, among South Asian populations. It aimed to engage and educate South Asian community leaders on key areas, including the local healthcare system, with particular emphasis on the Palliative Care Service. A mixed methods design was utilised. 3 Multicultural Health Officers (MCHOs) engaged in a User Experience (UX) workshop and identified South Asian populations across SWSLHD at greater risk of lower service use. In response, a 3-hour culturally specific educational forum, incorporating culturally appropriate storytelling and discussions on palliative care, was delivered to 40 South Asian community members and leaders. The forum was evaluated for changes in knowledge and understanding of palliative care among participants through pre-and-post surveys. Three main themes from the UX Workshop informed the forum’s agenda: (i) lack of awareness of palliative care and its services; (ii) family and support systems and (iii) faith and spiritual beliefs impacting on palliative care service utilisation. Evaluation of the forum reported 100% of participants having learned something new or valuable from the forum and the majority (77.8%) of participants reported increased confidence talking about and accessing information on palliative care and end of life. The forum’s use of personal storytelling, interactive discussions, and culturally sensitive approaches had a positive impact on increasing knowledge, skills, and value of palliative care among community members and leaders of South Asian origin. Replication of this culturally sensitive intervention is being undertaken, with a specific focus on expanding the work to include the engagement of younger South Asian community members to continue the conversation. 
 
 NSW Health, Australia Libraries are an essential component of the compassionate communities model. Their role as community hubs, providing a range of cultural, health and social programs, supports the nurturing of community life, with the role of librarians often likened to ad hoc social workers. Despite this, little has been done to engage libraries across the South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) in Sydney, Australia, in developing compassionate communities. This project aimed to build compassionate libraries by first equipping librarians across the SWSLHD with the knowledge and tools to support community members accessing information and resources regarding palliative care, illness, dying, death and bereavement. A quasi-experimental design was utilised based on a 2020 report by the SWSLHD Palliative Care Service, which found all (6) surveyed council librarians believing education and training about palliative care, life limiting illnesses, death, and bereavement to be beneficial. In response, a pilot 2-hour educational palliative care workshop, incorporating local palliative care services, relevant case studies and the role of libraries in compassionate communities, was delivered to librarians from the local government areas of Camden, Narellan and Oran Park. The workshop was evaluated for changes in knowledge and confidence in supporting community members around death and dying matters among participants through pre-and-post surveys. Four librarians from the Camden Community Libraries participated in the workshop. Findings included: (1) 100% of librarians strongly agreeing to being able to define palliative care in comparison to 28.6% prior to the workshop, (2) 100% increase in awareness and confidence of accessing information about SWSLHD palliative care services and (3) 66.7% feeling much more confident in having conversations about palliative care and end of life. This workshop has helped develop the knowledge and skills librarians possess to offer greater support to community members accessing information about palliative care services. The strong engagement observed among librarians in this intervention advocates for further work in this area. The SWSLHD Palliative Care Service aims to extend this intervention to neighbouring libraries across the district and further look at developing and/or tailoring existing library programs to enhance the compassionate communities model.

 In current clinical practice, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAKs) have gained importance as both therapy and prophylaxis. The survey was answered by 41 of 62 (66%) of experts. The majority (36/39, 92%), would generally consider secondary prophylaxis with a DOAK in the case of a previous DVT and LE in a cancer patient, and a life-expectancy of 3-6 months, provided there is no contraindication. Main reasons were the high risk of VTE recurrence and the benefit to the patient’s quality of life. Substance of choice was apixaban (27/32, 84%). Discontinuation was considered with a life expectancy of ⩽ 2 weeks (13/33, 39%) or a few days (12/33, 36%). Twentysix experts reported difficulties in decision making in case of TVT/LE in end-of-life care. 
 
 University of Auckland, New Zealand Semi-structured interviews with patients and family members who had received telehealth calls Focus groups and individual interviews with health professionals working in palliative care using telehealth. Data was analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. The key outcomes of the study include the development of a conceptual definition of rapport for clinical interactions based on the patients and family findings. Along with an adapted “Model of rapport and relatedness” which highlights participants experiences of interactions characterised as Connectedness, Disconnectedness, and Pseudo-rapport. This study adds important new knowledge about what constitutes rapport and how it is experienced during telehealth calls. This knowledge is useful for communicating to connect with patients and families. 
 
 Palliative Care Association of Uganda, Uganda In 2020, Uganda initiated a pioneering endeavour to integrate palliative care data into the national HMIS. A technical working group was formed, periodic meetings were held, and tool drafting was done followed by pretesting, and approval by the Ministry of Health. HMIS OPD 008 Unit Palliative Care Register HMIS 105c Health Unit Palliative Care monthly report. Over 50% of facilities offering palliative care in Uganda are reporting through the system and this has provided a more comprehensive understanding of palliative care services at facility, regional and national levels.

 1) Idea: Day after day, many terminally ill patients pass away without having had access to the care they would have needed. This is partly due to a lack of knowledge, apprehensions, misunderstandings, myths, and taboos surrounding palliative care among the general public, patients themselves, their close ones, and some healthcare professionals. Faced with this realization, it appeared necessary to create new ways of raising awareness and educating the general public and healthcare professionals who are not specialized in the palliative care approach. Thus was born the idea of a collaborative documentary theater project, focusing on the transition to palliative care, and serving as a starting point for a citizen conversation on the topic. 2) Achievements: Through the implementation of a rigorous participatory research-creation process, combining qualitative and art-based research methods, our transdisciplinary team co-created a sensitive, truthful, and educative play on palliative care. The fictional work was constructed and validated using the perspectives of patients, their close ones, and palliative care professionals, as well as during public readings. The final play was presented 15 times in the format of a video recording, followed by discussions with the audience. Furthermore, the play has been presented in an academic context to students in medicine, psychology, social work, nursing science, and bioethics. Pre-post descriptive and qualitative data on the understanding of palliative care, among other things, were collected after each presentation of the work. 3) Conclusion/Lessons learned: The collected data show that watching the play could contribute to a better understanding of palliative care among the general public and healthcare professionals who not specialized in the palliative care approach. The results further suggest that theater could be a relevant cultural mediation modality to demystify palliative care and dispel certain associated taboos. Nonetheless, certain challenges remain regarding the broad dissemination of the work, particularly in reaching marginalized populations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hospizgruppe Freiburg e.V., Germany Over the years different projects and changes to services (individual counselling, walking group, dancing group, gatherings at death cafes, discussion group for young widowed women and men, etc.) have been developed. Co-operations with different institutions and services have been built. A special service has been established to support grieving children, adolescents and young adults. This requires openness to face an unfamiliar reality. This open mind approach of care helps to meet the new and greater needs of our more diverse everchanging society. It needs flexibility of all people involved. It enhances resilience and seeks to discover underused or not all used human resources.

 Swiss Red Cross, Switzerland To make matters worse, people with a different socio-cultural background often have different perceptions of dying and death. Adequate information and awareness are needed in future, to improve the quality of life for these people in the terminal phase of life. Implementation Materials have been developed to make professionals and volunteers in various outpatient and inpatient palliative care settings more aware of migration-specific issues and improve their transcultural skills. Theoretical principles, exercises and other tools, such as checklists and questionnaires, have been developed or compiled based on the questions that arise in practice. The content has a modular structure so that the focus can be adapted to fit the individual. The exercises are used for introspection into one’s own actions and can be worked on in groups or individually. Module 1: Dealing with diversity – transcultural competence Module 2: Transcultural communication in a palliative care setting Module 3: Different perceptions of illness, dying and death Module 4: Relatives and decision-making Module 5: Spirituality, rituals, returning to the country of origin The modules were tested in training sessions with the staff of a Spitex institution and a retirement and nursing home. 
 
 The results of this project can be used to develop important recommendations for action for companies and organisations. The implementation of last aid providers in the workplace can be a promising approach to sensitively support people in burdensome situations at work. The more employees and managers know about the theoretical background, the better they can provide appropriate support.

 Haruka Community Palliative Care Support Center Social connection is essential to human well-being. To live a good life one needs mutual help and support from others, especially when faced with aging, serious illness or other troubles. In the city in northern Japan where I work as care manager, however, demographic aging is going on in a significant manner and the elderly people in growing numbers are socially isolated with the high percentage of elderly and single-person households. In addition there are those residents who relocated from east coastal areas after the 2011 East Japan Earthquake and subsequent. They often lack social connections. This leads to hinder not only cooperation and mutual assistance at the time of disaster but individual inhabitant’s good life. For the past 18 years, I’ve been leading a community project, based at local community palliative care support center, to foster ‘community connectors’ who accompany individual patients and families as well as palliative care volunteers. The training curriculum emphasizes the importance of experiencing the presence of the others with one’s mind and body. Developing compassion and new relationships, future ‘community connectors’ learn to act on their own initiatives. They support patients and families, take part in rehabilitation programs, and share treasures of local community with multi-generational and multinational residents. Our continuous efforts bear fruit of compassionate community and manifold social network. Mutual helping and supporting relations are built. When some patients find it challenging to go out, ‘community connectors’ visit their home and sing their favorite songs together. In times of bereavement, community members gather together to remember the dead, with Buddhist sutra chanted by terminal cancer priest who once suffered with alcoholic dependence. Some ‘community connectors’ host amateur singing contest with local residents, inviting people with multi-generational and multinational backgrounds including home care patients, care facility residents and those who moved from disaster affected areas. By remembering each life of fellow companions and expressing their own feelings in words, they get emboldened to live their own lives. By supporting others, they realize that they are also supported. We thus witness the emergence of compassionate community. 
 
 In Japan, demographic aging and decrease in population are going on in a significant manner. Social isolation of the elderly is one of the most serious social issues with changes in household structure. In rural areas it is difficult to secure enough medical professionals and caregivers with population concentration into major cities. New social ideas are needed to modify the governmental policy measure ‘community-based integrated care systems’ and the idea of Compassionate Cities and Communities (CC) is attracting more attention. Against this background we will share the ideas and practices of emerging CC in rural areas in Japan and their partnerships with CC in England. Participants, who are interested in community building in rural areas or exploring initial stages as well as current state of CC in non-European or East Asian contexts, will enjoy opportunities to enhance their understanding of CC and meet with new partners. Compassionate Communities Japan (CC-JP) was launched at the Japanese Society for Hospice and Home Care Conference in October 2023. There is now a CC-JP network meeting virtually each month with over 30 regular participants and several areas of Japan are starting to get involved in CC-JP activities. There is also a growing movement of CC-JP for Young Adults who recognise the importance of compassionate communities for their age group too. This proposed workshop consists of 4 short presentations, followed by dialogues with participants. The introductory presentation will be delivered by a Japanese philosopher, who translated Allan Kellehear’s

 School of Health Sciences Fribourg, HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland–Fribourg The aim of the poster will be to illustrate the approach of an optional course in nursing training on healthy dying from a community health perspective. We will present the content of the course and the reflections we had about “social representations”, “health promotion and death – what synergies” and “community care and healthy dying”. This module will be conducted over 5 days (1 week). It will start in January 2025 and will have three objectives: Conceive the link between health promotion and death, in particular by being able to explain the concept of “healthy dying” and “community care”. Reinforce, in the context of palliative care, one’s health promotion posture by developing a project. Develop a relational approach to health with the person in palliative care, in relation to bereavement and end-of-life issues. Examine the evolution of one’s representations of death and health. This project-based approach enables the empowerment of their health promotion posture and a reflection around death and the patient needs. To encourage their success, the lessons give some information on the health systems partners and the state of the art of contextual practice of healthy dying. 
 
 Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Ireland The survey questionnaire contained 110 questions, three of which were open-ended and 107 of which were closed-ended. The survey captured experiences of care provided in the last three months of life in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and the home. Questions regarding the standard of coordination between services and healthcare staff who cared for a person in the last three months of their life were included. A communications plan was successfully implemented to maximize the survey’s response rate. This included raising awareness of the survey via social media, information webinars and radio advertisements.

 have explored different potential approaches to making workplaces more compassionate communities in relation to death, dying, loss and care; have thought about the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches; be more aware of some of the real-world challenges intrinsic to encouraging more compassionate workplaces; have shared and learned about existing relevant workplace resources to support employees faced with serious illness, death and bereavement. The workshop draws on one research-based and one practice-based case study across five European countries where projects are underway to encourage more compassionate workplaces: the EU-CoWork project and the Scottish Bereavement-Friendly Workplaces Toolkit and Bereavement Charter Mark. EU-CoWork is co-creatively developing tailored Compassionate Workplace Programs in 12 workplaces across 4 European countries (BE, SE, AT and GR), employing developmental evaluation and an international mixed methods process and impact evaluation. In Scotland, work is underway to encourage employers to create more ‘bereavement-friendly’ workplaces through use of the Bereavement Charter Mark for Employers and the Scottish Bereavement-Friendly workplaces toolkit. Brief presentations on each project will outline their aims, approaches, challenges and learnings. Small group discussions will give delegates the opportunity to share their own experiences in this area; view and discuss some of the resources used in the case study areas; and think about whether elements from these projects might be of use in their own context. There will also be opportunities for questions to speakers and plenary discussion of key issues.

 There is an expression that community organizers flirt with in hopes it will be true:  Nova Scotia is home to 1 million people, many living in rural and semi-urban communities. GGNS was the first festival in Canada to bring the topic of grief into public view. Across 8 days, we hosted 36 events both virtually and in person. Advertising included social media, posters, radio and television engagement. Activities embraced the tenets of grief literacy in the following ways: - They were tailored to different ages, communities, genders, sexualities, incomes, and geographic locations. Many events were on-line. Most events were physically accessible, and at least one had sign language interpretation. - They included a range of griefs. For example, widows grieving their spouses; pet owner grieving their companions; newcomers reflecting on what they had to leave behind in their home countries. - They were in public places: For example, the main library in the provincial capital hosted a display of memorial tattoo photographs; people talked about their grief over restaurant meals; folks gathered in a park to learn about death doulas; people joined online to discuss estate planning; grievers missing their deceased pets went on hikes together. - They were hosted by individuals, community organizations, health care institutions, faith-based organizations, and research teams. Most events were free; some had ‘pay what you can’ entry fees. 
 This workshop is for anyone who would like to contribute to growing grief literacy in their networks and communities.

 The facilitators will introduce the participants to each other then the concept of compassionate communities. Compassionate communities are rooted in a health promotion approach to palliative care and encouraging end of life care within communities. In many cultures, taking care of the sick and dying was done within communities and in the past cultures had ways of supporting such individuals and families. The culture evolved due to colonization, modernization, education and uptake of religion. Many individuals now live and work in urban centers. Research shows that many patients still prefer to die at home but this is often not possible due to perceptions within communities. It is perceived as neglect when a patient dies at home and other challenges such as lack of caregivers or living in rental houses also makes it difficult to honour wishes of the dying. Many individuals end up dying in hospitals surrounded by healthcare providers and medical machines. Compassionate communities is therefore a public health approach to provision of palliative care by creating interactions between palliative care providers, local or government administration and communities. 
 The facilitators will ask participants to give their experiences on starting or running compassionate communities. The focus will be on how they started, what has worked for them and what lessons they have learned. These can be shared by upto 5 participant. 
 The participants will be split into smaller groups of about 7 – 10 participants and asked to discuss for 10 minutes and create a check list of items, resources, personnel that are crucial before starting a compassionate community. The session will be wrapped up by presentations from the group and creating one checklist.

 Mobile camps were designed to prevent and address essential SRH needs including gender-based violence, which are exacerbated during disasters. Integrated psychosocial support within the comprehensive SRH services can have profound effects on the affected population. Reviewing the programmatic data helps in identifying the unmet needs and re-strategizing the response intervention and advocacy, contributing to improving the overall health outcomes. 
 
 
 
 Compassionate Communities UK, United Kingdom Based on the participants, the questions related to ‘talking confidence’ and ‘practical hands on support’ scored well. However, when the questions started to ask about factual knowledge and access the results were reversed. This demonstrated that how information has been shared has not been effective. On the questions related to priorities, the data demonstrated the importance of emotional support, social connectedness and time with friends and family being of greater importance than other elements such as physical care or pain relief.

 Sue Ryder, United Kingdom Sue Ryder (SR), the UK’s bereavement charity, started its Grief Kind campaign in 2021, after research found that people struggled to support other who had experienced a bereavement. Grief Kind aims to educate the nation to meet grief with warmth, rather than shying away from conversations. SR created a TV ad to ensure grief is something that is normalised and talked about in the UK households. This has been watched by millions of people across the UK and has increased traffic to the website and sign ups to our online bereavement services. In October 2021, we launched our Grief Kind podcast series. In each episode, a SR Ambassador was joined by a celebrity who reflected on their bereavement journey and talked about who helped them through grief. To date, we had over 100,000 downloads. In 2022, SR launched Grief Kind classes, 5 short video tutorials, in which our SR bereavement experts talk viewers through what grief is like and how you can support others who are grieving. Viewed over 37k times, they provide valuable support to organisations and individuals to be Grief Kind. In 2022, SR launched The Empty Chair campaign, an exhibit with a dining table surrounded by 13 empty chairs that encouraged the public to be Grief Kind and offer those who are grieving a chair at their dinner table. The powerful exhibit made a real impact with coverage reach totalling 9.5 million+. It was taken to parliament to engage with MPs to encourage them to sign up to be more Grief Kind. Other public engagement campaigns included installing a red London phone box on Brighton seafront to encourage people to be honest about their feelings of grief and an artistic campaign to show how the senses can impact people’s grief when they least expect it.SR also places regular grief advice and thought leadership pieces in the media. A recent radio day reached over 9 million people. Grief Kind allows for lobbying work with the government, raising the profile of grief and what people need: bereavement leave, service pathways or grief on the school curriculum. Recently, SR has set up Grief Kind spaces across the UK, offering peer-to-peer support groups in cafes, hotels and local community centres. This public health campaign continues to grow and develop and has inspired services worldwide to use the materials and resources. It meets people where they are - shopping, walking by the sea, waiting for a bus, in their home or workplace and tackles issues important to raise and offering guidance.

 Most Significant Change analyzes narratives detailing transformations from an intervention, deriving, through consensus, one story that contains the most significant change. The Attentive Visitors workshop, in which 19 interviews were conducted with volunteers who participated in a training program in Flanders, provides an example. The process of deriving relevant stories from these interviews and working with stakeholder organizations to reach consensus about most significant change will be discussed. Contribution Analysis is aimed at inferring causality in complex programs. Using an iterative process, it enables researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to identify the contribution an intervention, and additional factors, has on a particular outcome. A theory of change is generated at the start of the evaluation and subsequently confirmed or revised during implementation. Examples of its application in the UK will be provided. Ripple Effects Mapping is designed to actively involve program stakeholders in describing and visually mapping their perceptions of the effects of a program. Two examples of REM will be provided, exploring: i) the ripple effects stemming from Compassionate University (Belgium) and ii) a modified use of REM to study the dissemination of the DöBra cards (Sweden) 
 Facilitated hands-on practical exercises will be held to further delve into each approach. Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in one approach session.

 Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft, Austria However, the “Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft” facilities (day hospice, “Mobiles Palliativteam”, outpatient clinic,ward) are also available to sick people within a short distance if required. Early palliative care, a multidimensional approach, as well as trust and continuity of care are sought and made possible. This is guaranteed by the cooperation with the association fort he homeless. Medical care for the uninsured, basic medical care service provided by the Red Cross and Caritas. Targeted social counseling is offered by the “Verein für Obdachlose”. Stays at the Hospice House are covered by “Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft”. The project is currently being implemented in the Innsbruck area. The specific support measures include accompaniment to doctors and hospitals. Possibly the return to he regular systems, “translation” of medical diagnoses and recommendations, organization of medication and aids. Care- especially wound care, acute interventions, sometimes just being there and listening. The project ist currently being financed by donations until 2026. 
 Many breaches of trust- it takes time to approach and build a relationship. The topic of bringing people into the center of society. Educational work – sensitizing society and the health system. It needs housing for sick and uninsured people. Involvement of those affected. Development and training for volunteers. Interdisciplinary approach. Colloboration with all homeless and homeless assistance facilities. Possibly scientific support Compassion and solidarity. 
 
 Northumbria University, United Kingdom Material Legacies is a five-year collaboration with The Hospice of St Francis, UK that uses practice research methods to co-create a collection of experiential artifacts, four documentation films, a series of specialist talks and two public exhibitions with three bereaved makers. This research creates novel practices that redefine the role of artistic collaborations with the bereaved, creating alternative spaces for a person’s physical and digital legacy. Material Legacies locates its approach to bereavement within continuing bonds theory, where the bereaved may explore a continued relationship with the dead (Walter, 1996). The narrative turn within hospice care (Gunaratnam and Oliviere, 2009) has potential to readdress the balance between “psycho-dynamic and artistic methods” (p.2), explored materially in art therapy literature (Mahony, 2001; Moon, 2010; Moon, 2016). Within this research a narrative approach is used to create conceptual prompts within the process of making – layering stories within the material as artifacts form and through the addition of sound and projection mapping. Documentation films [ Using co-design acknowledges that the bereaved have a distinct and nuanced knowledge of their relationship to the loss (Sanders & Stappers, 2008) and tackles traditional hierarchies around client-based therapy. By reflecting on a sustained two-year co-design process with the bereaved, this research advocates that in sensitive contexts collaborators must have agency at all stages of the design process, otherwise as solutions or products begin to form they impose design decisions on the community rather than activate collaborations with them (Bowen et al, 2013). This paper explores the diverse formats needed to develop ethical design practices that incorporate digital and public engagement through transparency, personal choice and collaboration.

 ACP is a process that is open to everyone - not just people at the end of life. Through ACP, individuals reflect on their personal values, wishes, and expectations regarding treatment and care in the event of illness or accident, thereby enhancing self-determination. There are different ways of dealing with the topic. The aim of normalizing ACP does not mean imposing a norm: there is no «right or wrong» in dealing with these sensitive issues. Measures to ensure that ACP becomes a normal part in life for all people who want it, regardless of age, place of living, phase in life, origin, health literacy and health condition; Assistance in appointing an authorized representative and in reflecting about unforeseeable and/or complex medical events, as well as dying and death; Supporting healthcare professionals in addressing ACP by strengthening their communication and methodological skills; Improving the quality and accessibility of documentation and the framework conditions for the remuneration of ACP services. The roadmap forms the basis for concrete projects to be implemented in the coming years. The challenge and at the same time the strength of the national initiative lies in the networking and cooperation with a large number of independent administrative, scientific and political structures. The aim is to continuously involve all the stakeholders at different levels and secure their support of.

 Prior research show that nursing students may experience dying as frightening, and feel uncertain and unprepared to communicate with patients nearing death and their families. An interactive learning activity was therefore created, including preparatory self-reflection on end-of-life preferences using the Swedish adaptation of the GoWish cards – the DöBra cards – followed by a seminar with group discussions.

 Heard about the development of Compassionate Schools, including engagement processes and possible actions, as generated via the Compassionate Schools European Learning Network. Reflected on how they would develop and facilitate their own Compassionate School, from their personal and professional perspectives. Engaged in critical discussion around the commonalities and essentialities in developing Compassionate Schools. This includes increasing awareness of and reflection on the availability and need for resources, readiness, inclusion of relevant partners, and the facilitation methods required to develop a Compassionate School. Compassionate Schools are places which are attentive to and actively address the educational and support needs of its community (students, staff, and families) at times of serious illness, caregiving, death, and bereavement. They recognise that these events are universal experiences that have an individual and collective impact and, as such, warrant attention: which today is not always the case. Through a series of actions, preventive measures, and educational activities, Compassionate Schools aim to meaningfully integrate such experiences into school life. Furthermore, by providing school communities with the proficiency to respond to such events, valuable skills are gained that both students and staff can use throughout their lives. This interactive workshop will introduce participants to the variety of possible actions that can be facilitated in and with schools, sharing learning from the Compassionate Schools European Learning Network. Participants will then be supported to engage in an in-depth discussion on steps they can take to develop their own Compassionate School, drawing on their local context and own positioning. Finally, participants will be provided with an overview of the commonalities and essentialities in the development of Compassionate Schools, exploring key issues around resources, readiness, partnership working, leadership, and the range of facilitation methods required to develop a whole schools approach to caregiving, serious illness, death, and bereavement. 
 
 
 
 Hopitaux Universitaire de Geneve, Switzerland According to two Swiss surveys, many elderly people would like to die at home. Reality is different and most die in hospital. There are numerous reasons for this discrepancy, notably the lack of end-of-life drugs available at home. General practitioners may be unfamiliar with prescribing and administering the “Four Essential Drugs Needed for Quality Care of the Dying,” which include analgesics, anti-secretory and/or sedatives. Trained and available home care teams are needed to support patients and provide active palliative care. General practitioners may not have palliative training, and palliative care team intervention may not always be possible/necessary. To assist these physicians, a comfort care order set was developed in conjunction with palliative care training. Order sets have proven to reassure, guide clinicians and prevent prescribing errors, thereby improving patient safety. Project: Computerized comfort care order sets for common end-of-life symptoms such as pain, anxiety, agitation, shortness of breath, and death rattle were created by an interdisciplinary group of geriatricians and palliative care specialists. Goals include preventing medication errors, promoting patient safety, and facilitating accurate end-of-life prescribing. Order sets include established protocols, doses, and non-drug interventions. Physicians can select the appropriate medication from a recommended list based on symptoms and efficiently change the dose/frequency. Once signed, medications appear in the patient’s record, also visible when the patient is admitted. It can also automatically generate a prescription for the pharmacy. Evaluation: A questionnaire will be sent to physicians using these comfort care order sets to assess their experience in prescribing end-of-life medications before and 3 months after implementation. A short training course in palliative care will be offered. Results will be analyzed based on improvement in physician comfort with prescribing and ease of prescribing the system’s integrated order sets. Comparison of opioid prescribing and documentation errors pre and post. Our hypothesis is that comfort care order sets will increase primary care physicians’ comfort level with prescribing of essential medications for end-of-life care at home and improve anticipation of emergency situations. These comfort care order sets may contribute to patient safety in general and may be extended to other settings, such as general internal medicine wards.

 Fondation Rive-Neuve, Switzerland This practical project is part of the need to rethink Palliative Care (PC) from a sustainable perspective. Our foundation currently offers specialist palliative care (SPC) in hospital and is recognized as a center of expertise: it receives patients, their families and relatives. Established in the heart of a small town, our foundation is characterized for its close links with the local population, making it easier to understand the specific needs of the context. It is currently engaged in a process aimed at expanding its range of support services. The project, which has a human dimension, promotes a community care approach, emphasizing collaboration with community health organizations and local health institutions to provide care centered on the specific needs of each patient. In this region, there is no access to first line specialized palliative care at home or in nursing home. The introduction of a new model aims to provide 1st line primary care directly at home and in nursing home by offering a 24/7 telephone hotline (for patients and staff) to respond concretely with field interventions in case of palliative emergency needs. The service will provide a full assessment, personalized medical treatment, coordination with existing teams and advanced technical care, all under the supervision of a medical and nursing team. For several years, health professionals and hospital management have been making clinical observations, which is supported by research into scientific and political findings. In order to adapt the project to the context, an analysis of resources was necessary. At the same time an assessment of barriers and facilitators was undertaken. Careful planning, proactive risk management and taking advantage of opportunities can ensure the success of such a pivotal initiative for the community. It remains essential to be agile and resilient in the face of challenges throughout the project. The sustainability of the Swiss healthcare system is being significantly challenged, highlighting the fact that medicine is based on a model of infinite progress, raising expectations that are oQen unrealistic, while the financial and human resources required are limited. This project to improve access to PC is designed to be implemented in the context of the evolution of the healthcare environment and the needs to support societal changes aimed at ensuring its sustainability

The workshop will further explain the rationale and methodology used to identify the social and economic impact of this approach and explore how this methodology and tools can be used to support attendees’ work. Interactive discussions will explore what evaluation tools attendees have used for the different target groups in their programs, what they were aiming to achieve and what worked or did not work when formal and informal networks have partnered together. 
 
 Scaled mean scores between the DLI-revised and the shorter version were assessed for statistical differences. The internal reliability of the DLI-revised and shorter version was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. For the shorter version, an EFA identified a 9-item, two-factor structure model. The model demonstrated an excellent fit with TLI and CFI values exceeding 0.95 and SRMR less than 0.05. The measurement invariance showed a comparable means between males and females. The DLI-9 and DLI-29 were strongly correlated (0.98). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for both revised DLI scales and subscales and the shorter version of the DLI exceeded 0.8, indicating high internal consistency. 
 
 295 (24.5%) reported that they had learnt about end-of-life issues, including death, dying, and grief, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One in twenty people (67) cared for someone dying with COVID-19, while one in ten (135) experienced the death of a close family member or friend due to COVID-19. Two in ten (219) knew someone who died from COVID-19. Around 28% (341) of the participants attended a funeral, while 10% (111) organised a funeral during the pandemic. Similarly, 303 participants (25.2%) said that they learnt about end-of-life issues because of the introduction of VAD laws in Australia. Nearly 5% (59) reported having a caring role for someone approved for VAD. Ninety participants knew someone planning to use VAD, while 80 knew people who died using VAD. Participants reporting any form of experience related to the COVID-19 pandemic and VAD had significantly higher death literacy scores (including scores on overall index, scales and subscales) than those who did not. 
 It has been previously reported that Death Literacy is a concept that develops through personal, work and education experiences. This study provides further insights into the development of death literacy.

 Hogeschool Rotterdam Online dialogue sessions involving discussions with both students and staff were held, revealing that many students grapple with grief and loss. Interviews were conducted among staff regarding their experiences with DGLC in the workplace, highlighting an individualised need for attention at these subjects. In a minor course on palliative care, students undertook an assignment on art and grief, interviewing fellow students on the subject. This resulted into a recommendation for the incorporation of art-based solace in RUAS. Furthermore, various “drops” were implemented to draw attention to DGLC. These included the director’s acknowledgment of grief and loss at the academic year opening; a table in the central hall featuring a journal for anyone to write about what matters, along with cards containing inspiring questions that passersby can answer; and posters focusing on DGLC. In “living room conversations” staff and students shared stories about DGLC; evaluation indicated that sharing personal experiences in a safe space at school and workplace, fulfilled a need to feel heard and understood, a practice they wish to continue. We contributed to the film ‘Connecting Communities – Inspiring perspectives on palliative care’ by Agora and PZNL, launched during the 2023 EAPC World Congress. Amongst other initiatives, the film portrays the development of the C-UAS. 
 
 When interested, offer gradually intensifying ways of engaging in hospice movement to enable a prompt start in volunteering and first practical experiences for young adults they can further build on. Within services and institutions value diversity in people, tasks and ways of training and supervision. Thus, acknowledge individual strengths and experiences different people contribute to the movement. Bring together the new and young and the old and approved as both share the same core values of hospice care and their motivation for volunteering is similar. Finally, volunteers in hospice movement are more than companions to the dying. They serve as multiplier of the hospice culture within their own peer groups contributing to increasing death literacy in society.

 CS Caritas Socialis GmbH, Dementia-Friendly 3rd District, Vienna,Austria The dementia-friendly 3rd District was established in 2014 with the goal of developing and promoting awareness and civic engagement. Various offerings are intended to reach people with dementia and forgetfulness, as well as their relatives and companions, in a low-threshold manner. The dementia-friendly 3rd District is a growing care network centered on individuals who need guidance and counseling. Since its founding, one of the primary goals of the network partners has been sustainable awareness-raising, knowledge dissemination, destigmatization, and visibility of forgetfulness and dementia. The network is characterized by its openness to new trends and societal developments, which represents another goal. Following this objective, the “Promenz Gruppe 1030” has been part of the network since 2023. In line with the first objective of the Österreichische Demenzstrategie (Austrian Dementia Strategy), “Ensuring participation and self-determination of those affected,” representatives of the network worked together with PROMENZ between autumn 2022 and summer 2023 to implement the project “Promenz Gruppe 1030.” The necessary resources for this were distributed among the network partners. The first “Promenz Gruppe 1030” was able to start in September 2023. Users benefit from both the exchange and counseling, which fosters supportive relationships, and from becoming self-advocates who speak about their condition at conferences and collaborate in working groups with Gesundheit Österreich GmbH. In each of the regular network meetings, the network partners exchange proven practices and new ideas. Central to these considerations is the question of resources. Ideas and actions can only be implemented in small steps using the network’s own resources. Implementation is done voluntarily or as an organizational contribution from the participating network organizations. Despite this, the network is growing and is committed to “Dementia Literacy,” because dealing with dementia and forgetfulness must become natural. To achieve this goal, sustainable awareness-raising and knowledge dissemination at various levels, as well as the participation of those affected and the enabling of experiential knowledge in the population, are what the dementia-friendly 3rd District network tirelessly and continuously strives for.

 Workshop participants will learn: a systematic and transferrable method for designing invitations to convene community groups that explicitly declare the aspirational intention of the convenor, a worked example of an invitation that is personalised to the participant’s context that they can take away and implement, and an enhanced understanding of how to describe the intended experience of the group memeber, as well as being transparent about what is expected of them. An aim to spread the Compassionate Communities movement is for organisations and individuals to identify reciprocal benefits in forging new collaborative partnerships. The importance and potential of a well-crafted invitation to bring about intended collective action is often underestimated. The art of invitation involves so much more than communicating the basic details surrounding an event or occasion. It refers to a set of skills and practices to attract, inspire, and motivate people to coalesce on a mutually beneficial theme. The intended outcome of their collective action will be to generate positive change. To spread the principles of public health palliative care requires involvement across diverse sectors of society. When convening community-based action learning groups - the invitation initiates the collaborative process. The invitation influences group size and membership, which can mediate the success of subsequent group activities. However, community organisers can feel unsure about how to take this first step. How can we increase our confidence that the people who turn up to a community meeting are the intended people we are hoping to engage and that they are clear on the expectations we have as convenors? In the workshop, attendees will engage in a systematic yet creative method of inviting community participation and convening groups of likeminded people around a mutual theme of interest. The skills they will learn are transferrable to other activities linked to co-production. Each workshop participant will leave with a personalised example of an invitation they can use in their unique context. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In this workshop the participants will: Learn about the genesis of, and drivers for, the development of a pan-Canadian collaborative on equity-oriented palliative care; Identify barriers and develop solutions to integrate equity-oriented palliative, identifying the critical role that context assessment plays in successful implementation processes; Consider lessons learned from a pan-Canadian implementation of equity-oriented palliative care, reflecting on challenges, successes, and the adaptations required to achieve equitable, safe, and high-quality care for (and with) structurally vulnerable populations; Identify best practices for equity-oriented palliative care; and Develop skills to become champions (or allies) in improving palliative care access and gaining access to practical tools and resources for local, national, and international implementation. 
 The “Improving Equity in Access to Palliative Care” (IEAPC) collaborative is a pan-Canadian initiative to improve access to palliative care for individuals experiencing homelessness or vulnerable housing. The collaborative examines equity-oriented approaches to care that address systemic and structural issues and identifies innovative practices in implementing equity-oriented palliative care for people experiencing structural vulnerabilities. The IEAPC collaborative is a four-year initiative that supports over 20 communities representing 85+ organizations across Canada to design, deliver and evaluate equity-oriented palliative care initiatives in their respective communities. Communities receive funding, access to subject matter experts, site visits to leading equity-oriented palliative care models in the country, peer-to-peer learning and collaboration, and a tailored curriculum that supports all aspects of implementation. In this workshop we will present information about the IEAPC collaborative, sharing lessons learned, tools and resources developed, and evaluation strategies. Following didactic presentations from clinicians, researchers, educators, and health administrators, we will engage participants in interactive small group work to design equity-oriented strategies for implementation in their own communities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 SatiSaanti, Thailand End-of-life and palliative care often revolve around planning and transitioning to death for individuals. Simultaneously, the emotional landscape involves navigating palliative care and pursuing one’s life purpose and goals. It is crucial to recognise that palliative care is not solely relevant to older individuals; early awareness benefits all, fostering understanding of life, acceptance, and making the most of our time. Advanced dementia necessitates palliative care to ensure a dignified death, presenting challenges such as diminished decisional capacity and reliance on proxy decision-making. Stigmatisation exacerbates these difficulties, leading to rejection, discrimination, and social exclusion, necessitating concerted efforts to raise social awareness. In Thailand, fostering such awareness is crucial, and adopting an art-based approach can profoundly reshape perceptions of ageing and dementia, transcending perception barriers. The “Healing Light Exhibition,” held at the Palette Art Space in Bangkok from December 7th to December 18th, 2023, provided a platform for meaningful dialogue among diverse participants, including medical professionals, informal caregivers, artists, and students. This exhibition served as a focal point for an exploratory study aiming to examine the role of art and awareness by using cyanotype to explore Thai content. Employing autoethnography as a research approach, this study explored personal experiences to gain insights into broader cultural phenomena. Field notes and sketches were analysed thematically to uncover novel perspectives on dementia and palliative care. The healing light exhibition centred on discussions about dementia and palliative care, highlighting individual perspectives and societal constructs of self-identity. Often overlooked in dementia care design are art’s emotional and therapeutic dimensions, as designers and architects tend to prioritise physical aspects. Consequently, a gap exists between the needs of people with dementia and existing norms. Recommendations should explore various art mediums, contents, and environments to conduct therapeutic engagement, which can increase public awareness. Additionally, future research should gauge and measure the long-term impact and efficacy of innovative arts-based approaches in palliative care in Thailand.

 The personal transformation of the caregiver through EoL care was consisted of the diverse changes such as self-reflection and reinforcement of values, based on experiences with people around her in her life. It can be said that the creation of diverse places and networks where bereaved members can connect at the right time and demonstrate their compassion is important for the spread of CCs in the future.

 Gentle Death Education and Planning, Australia As the need for increased death literacy (Noonan 2016) increases globally, in tandem with an ageing population in much of the world, both assisted and unassisted deaths are being held to standards of transparency and accountability in terms of quality of life at end of life. The Lancet Commistion report on the Value of Death (2022) offers a framework for considerations that point way forward for discussing and considering the notion of a ‘good death’, not only for the person at end of life, but also for their familes and friends. End of life doulas, non-medical support workers to the dying and their close, caring networks are uniquely positioned to enhance and improve both individual and community death literacy standards. As educators, advocates and witnesses to the preparations for end of life, active dying and (often) the immediate work of after-death body care, end of life doulas offer a compassionate presence and a well-informed, evidence-based approach to information transfer when discussing rights, options and choices at end of life. Obviously the concept of a ‘good’ death is highly individualised and deeply personal, and the better-informed and prepared an individual is, the higher the probability that a death that is as close to an individual’s wishes as possible will take place. Good planning, which is another aspect of end of life doula work in general terms, is also highly beneficial in ensuring that options for alternate decisions are well in hand, keeping stress and unnecessary anxiety at bay during a time that may otherwise be quite challenging for both the dying and their caregivers. A well-planned end of life, coupled with thorough conversations and time spent with the person both during their end of life and immediately following death, helps avoid complex and traumatic grief for those left after their person’s death, and end of life doulas are playing an increasing role in facitliating conversations with families and with communities. Based on original qualitative research with end of life doulas in four countries, the role of end of life doula, the position of death literacy for practitioners, and future directions for the field are considered with a focus on increasing both death and grief literacy in a variety of settings, including hospitals, hospices, and homes. Quotes from semi-structured interviews will be shared, casting an essential light on the work and future potential of this robust and growing international field. 
 
 
 
 A key remit of public health palliative care is to address inequalities at the end of life. However, little is known about the end-of-life experiences of intersectionally marginalised groups who experience multiple systems of power and oppression, such as racism, sexism and classism, simultaneously. A method proposed to support greater access and inclusion of such individuals in research is to have community researchers as part of the core research team. We define community researchers as individuals with similar social identities, heritage and location to the research participants of interest. However, how best to work with community researchers in the context of structural inequalities at the end of life remains poorly understood.

 Fasiuddin Khan Research Foundation, Bangladesh, People’s Republic of From the original group a cohort of 7 semi-educated respondents were selected, belonging to 7 different slums, for follow-up interviews with a WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. It was typical for patients to have several comorbidities. Anxiety, sadness, and depression were the most commonly reported psychological symptoms. Among the intensive intervention group, home-based palliative care had a significant impact on psycho-social and spiritual care, especially for family caregivers and neighbors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Patients and family members, including friends are seen as the ‘unit of care’ in palliative care. Best care for the dying patient, therefore, is achieved by offering optimal support for physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering to all persons involved in these often highly distressing situations. This study is part of a large international cohort study within the EU-funded ‘iLIVE-project’.

 University of Vienna, Austria With our contribution we want to participate in the exchange of experiences from compassionate cities in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, D/A/CH). How can people at the end of life who live alone at home be well supported and cared for? How can people with forgetfulness and disorientation be helped to find their way around in everyday life? Who looks after those who are socially and economically disadvantaged or socially marginalised? How can we, how can society contribute to ensuring that marginalised groups are not forgotten? These are questions that lie at the interface between palliative care and community care. In order to address these questions, we have set up a network in the German-speaking world, departing from the Institute of Nursing Science at the University of Vienna. Together with the network, we have started a writing project focusing on the question: “Social participation - how to include >hard-to-reach< groups”? In this volume, the personal and professional experiences and expertise of the members of the network will each shed light on one or more specific aspects of the issue of social participation of hard-to-reach groups. Telling and sharing these with each other - also in writing - supports and promotes mutual understanding. The network has so far met 5 times online in half-day moderated networking workshops. A first meeting in person is planned for Fri 18 October 2024 in Vienna. The joint publication will be presented there and the further network process will be decided.

 Palliative Medicine, is a robust, competency based, accredited field of medicine whose very genesis was organic and gradually emergent just over the last 40 years. Despite the incredible contributions Palliative medicine has made to evidence based, person centred care for people approaching the end of life, attention to the community itself has often not been one if its pillars. In this unique presentation, an academic physician and focused practice professor of palliative medicine nearing the end of her career, will participate in a frank dialogue-interview style-with a social media based influencer in public health palliative care. Together they will identify both the conscious and often unconscious drivers that influenced a generation of palliative medicine clinicians. Uncomfortable realities of how doctors are socialized and trained will be identified and the real, albeit unintended consequences of evidence based biomedical training in healthcare will be named. This first person account will focus on the lived and learned experience of this leader in palliative care and how a mid/late career jolt enabled a humble pivot that helped reframe training and competencies in palliative medicine to “re-imbrace” community. Lessons learned and importantly, future directions will be highlighted.

 “De Kolibrie”, established in 2016, is literally an open house where people facing a chronic illness - as patients or in their immediate environment - can walk in to share their stories with a trained volunteer. They can also take part in a diverse range of activities based on positive health. Our goals are: - Increasing empowerment - Improving quality of life - Increasing their knowledge about their specific challenge - Supporting people in the acceptance process, coping with grief and loss - Improving health, grief and death literacy - Preparing for and learning to cope with the last phase of life and its impact on day-to-day life We believe it is important that everyone can enjoy “De Kolibrie” regardless of their financial means, so we provide our activities free of charge. Donations and free contributions are the only source of income to support our operation. We are therefore a purely volunteer organisation that receives no structural support. Our team dedicates itself voluntarily day after day for free. By partnering with other organisations we are expanding our impact and strengthening the network of support essential for the well-being of our community. 
 We offer a wide range of activities including - leif-sessions (leif is the abbreviation of End-of-Life Information Forum): intimate conversations in which individuals, couples or families - supported by leifcounsellors - can discuss, share and record their wishes and concerns around the end of life. - Sessions around grief counselling that go beyond individual support. Here, on the one hand, we have the set of 6 pre-structured workshops where we provide methodologies and the free groups. By offering group sessions, we try to create a platform where participants can support each other and make connections with others going through similar experiences. - Where appropriate, we involve family members, friends and neighbours in individual end-of-life support. In this way, we aim to strengthen the support network and try to create a warm environment where no one needs to be alone during this delicate stage of life. 
 About 2,700 visits per year Approximately unique 310 visitors per year, with our guests being referred by doctors, other local health partners and word-of-mouth Positive results on satisfaction surveys Our numbers prove that initiatives like ours are much needed and add value within local communities. 
 
 Target audience: We connected through shared experiences of partnering with, and learning from, different populations in how people and communities want to be seen and cared for, elements that are often lost in a quest for palliative care specialization and standardization. We found mutual connection in understanding our role as guests, witnesses and learners, not experts and teachers, to illness suffering and caring. We hold a common ambition to center compassion and humility in caring and research practice. 
 Provide a forum for sharing stories, perspectives, and lessons on connection, compassion and humility in palliative care practice and research across diverse communities and populations. Use a design science approach to extract explicit principles from implicit knowledge and experience, to build and develop consensus around a Humility Reflection Guidance amongst workshop participants. 
 Presentations on palliative care across marginalized populations and diverse settings, with researcher perspectives on what we have learned, how we have been personally changed by the people and communities with whom we have worked, and the common threads across our work. Description of the design process to draft a Humility Reflection Guidance. Facilitated group discussion using a design science approach to build consensus on a Humility Reflection Guidance. After the conference, we will finalize and share the guidance with participants for review, with a plan for wider dissemination of our conclusions. 
 
 
 
 Edgewood College, United States of America The notion of ambiguous loss is anchored in Pauline Boss’s family experience of immigration to the United States in 1929. In her theory, she notes there are two types of ambiguous loss: where there is a physical absence with psychological presence (such as a person who has been “disappeared”), and where there is a psychological absence with physical presence (such as dementia). This presentation will focus on the first type of ambiguous loss where there is physical absence with psychological presence: the physical loss of someone that may remain unverified and may be without resolution, but for which memories can serve as a psychological presence of the missing individual. The role of secondary losses, such as communities, patriotic identity, and assumptive world, will be considered. Over 89 million people have been forcibly displaced as of 2021, including 36.5 million below age 18. All share a struggle with ambiguous grief and loss that is just beginning to be studied. For refugees, ambiguous loss is often characterized by hopes for refuge, longing for the past, and an endless sense of loss. This presentation will examine what one example of forced displacement looked like, and how refugee experiences can be conceptualized. It will then turn to the stories of refugees, in particular Sudanese youth living in Michigan known as the Lost Boys, and their ways of coping with the ambiguous loss of living apart from families and culture. To survive and thrive, these youth drew on relationships with peers, the presence of elders as a created surrogate family structure, and the psychological presence of their parents through remembering life lessons. Finally, tips for supporting refugee families will be discussed. 
 
 Abalone Consulting, United Kingdom The Lancet Commission on the Value of Death (2022) set out 5 principles and many recommendations to improve people’s experiences of dying/grief through major cultural and system change. However, this will only become reality if people in local communities engage with these ideas and develop their own locally-based actions. This project is to test a series of workshops using participatory and creative methods to introduce the Lancet Commission concepts to community participants with no prior specialist knowledge, in ways that can stimulate ideas for change and community action. The project uses a Participatory Action Research approach, with place-based participant sourcing in a city in Southern England. A range of methods are being used with intention to create accessible, enjoyable ways for participants to engage with Lancet Commission concepts, including: Short expert videos to introduce the 5 principles of a Realistic Utopia and stimulate response Facilitated conversations Collective collaging to explore structural determinants of death, dying and grief Stone-painting, placement and (re)arrangement to explore death systems Nature connection ‘If.. Then.. And’ statements Facilitated action-planning Further workshops are planned March–July 2024 and will continue to experiment with such methods to enable people to collaboratively explore these topics, community action and social change. Some deliberative methods may be used. Participants in the first workshop (December 2023) reported it as ‘thought-provoking’, ‘moving’, ‘stimulating’ ‘informative’ and ‘essential’. The use of short expert videos to introduce key Lancet Commission concepts was effective and elicited active discussion. Participants’ responses and creative outputs demonstrated that they had understood concepts including social determinants and dying as a relational and spiritual process, and had actively engaged in consideration of what could be different and how change might be achieved. Several expressed desire for further workshops to learn more and enable deeper exploration and to be involved in place-based change. Creative and participatory methods are effective in communicating key concepts from the Lancet Commission on the Value of Death to community participants who lack prior knowledge of these issues. Community workshops are an effective method of engagement, and have potential to catalyse involvement in community action and system change to implement the Lancet Commission ideas.

 Koordinierungsstelle für Hospiz- und Palliativversorgung in Deutschland, Germany The Charter process from 2008 to 2016 significantly advanced the further development of hospice and palliative care in Germany on the basis of the 5 Charter key principles. The participation of over 50 institutions and organizations relevant to society and health policy in the consensus process underlines the importance of the goals of the Charter and the recommendations for action adopted by consensus. In particular, Key Principle 1 of the Charter emphasizes social responsibility and the necessary solidarity of fellow human beings when accompanying the dying. On this basis, the aim is to spread the topics of dying, death and mourning across society and thus (re)integrate them into the context of people’s lives in Germany. The aim of the further implementation of the charter is therefore to promote the development of caring communities (this also includes compassionate communities) in the spirit of the Charter for the Care of the critically Ill and the Dying in Germany in order to promote the (further) development of what is, above all, an institution-and professional-centered care at the end of life to a community-oriented (re)care culture in Germany, to strengthen citizens in dealing with the topics of dying, death and grief and to promote their skills. Based on a qualitative nationwide inventory of the ongoing and completed (pilot) projects, two expert groups will be set up to support the development of sustainable caring community structures in Germany. One group is developing a workshop concept to support initiatives in establishing and expanding network structures around the topics of dying, death and grief. The other group develops recommendations for action in order to provide information on the launch and further procedure of corresponding initiatives. Caring communities in the sense of the charter arise where professional actors in hospice and palliative care work together with civil society, private sector and political actors and work together to ensure the conditions for a dignified death for all local citizens and mutual care. The charter process can be linked here. The Charter Round Table has established itself as a suitable platform for joint work. Author: Anne-Susanna Dreßke Co-author: Dr. Birgit Weihrauch 
 
 Healthy End of Life Project (HELP) Ottawa, a community-based, participatory action research project which served as a pilot for a Canadian version of a similar research endeavor at LaTrobe University in Australia (Grindrod & Rumbold, 2016, 2018). Aligned with the work of Dr. Allan Kellehear (Kellehear, 2005, 2013, 2020, 2022) and the international Compassionate Communities movement, HELP Ottawa was funded by the Mach-Gaensslen Foundation of Canada, a private foundation, and sponsored by Compassionate Ottawa (a non-profit organization),and hosted at Carleton University. Over the course of the project (2019-2022), HELP Ottawa worked at four sites, Christ Church Bells Corners, Orleans United Church, and Centretown and South-East Ottawa Community Health Centre, conducting baseline research, building capacity in research and community development, and developing, implementing and evaluating project initiatives based on the research findings. Over forty initiatives were implemented across the four sites, and eight multimedia toolkits have been created, to support other sites in building their own site-specific initiatives. Building on the momentum established by HELP Ottawa, Tri-Council funding was received to support toolkit translation, knowledge mobilization, knowledge translation and capacity building through four community-site forums, and a community-wide Summit. The four forums will be tailored to each of the host sites and will include interactive presentations, experiential learning activities, and future planning. The Summit will engage a broader audience, including decision makers, to establish an Action Plan with the goal of building more compassionate responses to death, dying, grief, and loss in Ottawa. Each of the forums and the Summit will be open to the public and extend the knowledge mobilization beyond the community. Engaging with over 200 participants, from community members, site facilitators, site leaders, health and social service providers, graduate students, government representatives, and policy makers through four forums and a final Summit. Further, we expect a wider audience will engage with the translated toolkits online. Our hope is to empower communities to be part of end-of-life care.",[],2024-10-10,Palliative Care and Social Practice,"""sti"""
11467937,Hippocampal dopamine as a key regulator for learning deficits in Parkinson’s disease,,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with clinical symptoms of involuntary or uncontrollable movements such as tremors, rigidity, and incoordination. The learning deficit is largely overlooked in the past because it is generally less impaired in the early stages of PD than in Alzheimer’s disease. However, recent studies have shown a significant decline in learning in PD. In addition to a lower learning rate, PD patients require substantially more brain activity and neural networks during the learning task, indicating a reduced learning efficiency. Furthermore, memory deficits are also common in PD even without the presence of overt dementia (Aarsland et al., 2021). Given the increasing prevalence of PD worldwide and the fact that symptoms typically start out mild and get worse over time, research into the mechanism of learning deficits in PD is of great importance. One distinctive neuropathological hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Most individuals with PD have lost 60–80 percent or more of their dopamine-producing cells in the SNc by the time symptoms manifest (Poewe et al., 2017). This decline in DA levels could severely impair the reward-prediction signal in the mesolimbic system and contribute to learning deficits. Another hallmark of PD is the degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), where neurons appear to co-release norepinephrine and dopamine and are involved in attention and reward learning (Zhang et al., 2023). Intriguingly, the hippocampus, a critical limbic structure for learning and memory, receives projections from both the midbrain and LC dopamine-releasing neurons. There is a significant reduction in hippocampal volume in PD compared to healthy controls in some imaging studies, but there is little evidence of alternation in volume, or neuronal/glial loss in the stereological study (Villar-Conde et al., 2021). Instead, the hippocampal changes in PD may occur at the synaptic level, the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, or relate to neurogenesis, affected by the altered dopaminergic modulation. Dopamine regulates reward learning, motivation, and movement. It has been long established that firing patterns in midbrain dopamine neurons parallel the computation of reward prediction error signals in machine learning, serving as a teaching signal. Specifically, dopamine neurons fire in response to novel stimuli or unexpected rewards. The firing rate ramps up when the reward is uncertain, soars when the reward exceeds expectations, and dips when the reward falls short of expectations (Schultz, 2016). As a result, degeneration in the dopaminergic system should have a major impact on the severity of learning deficits in PD. While motor symptoms are closely linked with the nigrostriatal pathway, especially in the early stage of the disease, other learning-related functions worsen with disease severity. The affected cognitive functions include generalization, feedback-based learning, new information organization, memory retrieval, task-switching, and attention. Dopamine achieves its modulatory effects on above mentioned learning and memory associated functions through the D1 and D2 receptors in the hippocampus. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) and LC primarily project to the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions, while the SNc primarily projects to the CA2 region where the pathological protein α-synuclein shows significant distribution. These structural-specific projections are believed to have distinct roles in modulation learning and memory consolidation. D1 receptors are densely detected in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and CA1, while D2 receptors are exclusively expressed in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus (Gangarossa et al., 2012). D1 receptor in the dentate gyrus is critical for controlling spike timing-dependent plasticity, serving as the basis of reward learning, whereas D1R knockout or D1R antagonist in the CA1 blocks the late phase of long-term potentiation, suggesting the synaptic plasticity is strongly dopamine-dependent. One major dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus originates from the midbrain. These dopaminergic terminals can be observed throughout the hippocampal CA1 region. A recent human study by Elliott et al. (2022) measured the structural connectivity between the midbrain and hippocampus using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed its correlation with reward learning and memory performance. Stronger structural connectivity between the two regions was associated with enhanced memory encoding in response to rewards, but not to neutral stimuli. The study suggests that the midbrain-hippocampus structural connectivity plays a selective role in reward-related learning and memory encoding. Midbrain dopaminergic innervation of the hippocampus is sufficient for aversive learning and spatial learning (Tsetsenis et al., 2022). In addition to new information detection via the functional loop of VTA dopamine neurons and hippocampus, hippocampus dopamine release from both SNc and VTA projections can facilitate long-term potentiation, and enhance learning and long-term memory. The two midbrain dopamine sources are involved in distinct psychological processes of instrumental learning. While SNc dopamine neurons support accurate, time-limited, action-specific learning that is rigid, VTA dopamine neurons infuse cues and associated actions with the motivational value that allows flexible and persistent reward seeking (Fraser et al., 2023). The other major dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus recently identified originates from LC, one of the first areas undergoing degeneration in PD (Paredes-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Dopamine released from the LC terminals in dorsal CA1 is required for spatial learning and contextual memory linking, but not memory formation. Dopaminergic innervation from the LC in the dentate gyrus has been implicated in reinforcement learning. DA from hippocampal LC terminals produces a grace period of memory persistence and ‘flashbulb-like’ memories for unrelated events (Duszkiewicz et al., 2019). Interestingly, all these dopamine actions in either dorsal CA1 or dentate gyrus are mediated through D1-like receptors. Therefore, the deterioration of major hippocampal dopamine sources can be one of the key factors for learning deficits in PD. First, midbrain dopaminergic fibers may tightly instruct learning by selectively targeting specific synapses or cell types in the hippocampus and mark significant events, degeneration of which impairs cue and value-based learning; Second, LC dopamine release terminals possibly result in non-selective, widespread modulatory effects, and degeneration of which weakens widespread alertness, spatial learning and memory linking in varied salient situations. It is in line with the physical and cognitive symptoms of PD that impair patients’ capacity to build an adaptive model for guiding future behavior. Another noteworthy aspect is that newborn neurons play an essential role in the learning and memory circuitry of the adult brain, while the hippocampus is one of the few brain areas that can continue to produce new neurons during adulthood. However, fewer neural progenitor cells, declined neuronal survival rate and impaired plasticity have been reported in the dentate gyrus of PD patients or PD animal models with SNc DA depletion. Although the exact cause of the significant hippocampal changes in PD is still elusive, it is most likely associated with the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. This is because DA also plays a crucial role in promoting neurogenesis and the proliferation of neural cells in the hippocampus (Ohira, 2020). It is still controversial how the dopamine signal is transduced in mediating the promoting effect of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Dopamine can induce neural precursor cell proliferation mediated by epidermal growth factor. Similarly, entacapone, a modulator of dopamine, improves hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. In addition, D1 receptor-dependent antidepressant treatment increases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Activation of D1-like receptor likely promotes the growth factor-mediated proliferation. The critical role of hippocampal dopamine in the learning process can also be demonstrated by conventional L-Dopa treatment, which improved PD patients’ recent memory, long-term verbal and visual memory that relies on the hippocampal function (Kulisevsky, 2000). Indeed, decreased dopamine levels in the hippocampus could accelerate the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, whereas L-Dopa could inhibit or even dissolve fibrils of α-synuclein. According to a pharmacological fMRI study, hippocampus BOLD signals were linked to L-Dopa’s effects on memory function in senior people with a loss of dopamine neurons during normal aging. Learning efficiency was similarly enhanced in normal subjects using L-Dopa in a dose-dependent manner. However, adverse effects during dopamine replacement therapy may lead to pathological gambling, compulsive drug use, punding, and worsened reversal learning, indicating the role of dopamine in maladaptive behaviors. While dopamine replacement therapy has been shown to alleviate learning deficits, there are some limitations and issues that need to be addressed. Given the importance of hippocampal dopamine in PD learning deficits, the following aspects merit attention in future research to develop more effective treatments. First, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal dopamine action on learning-related cognitive dysfunction during Parkinson’s disease progression. Analysis of changes in the human hippocampal proteome in PD can provide essential information. Given that Parkinson’s disease symptoms vary across different stages, it is imperative to determine how hippocampal dopamine exerts its modulatory role in the different stages, and what kind of tailored treatment should be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, the effect of hippocampal dopamine on learning may depend on the source, timing, and receptor subtype of dopamine signaling, minimizing the side effects of dopamine therapy is a crucial challenge. Additionally, dopamine therapy often fails to produce the desired therapeutic effects in the late phase of Parkinson’s disease, and thus, further research is required to explore potential solutions for improving the efficacy of the treatment. Second, further studies are required to effectively and accurately mimic dopamine’s physiological function in the hippocampus using exogenous drugs. Spike-dependent phasic dopamine release represents a go signal caused by a salient external stimulus that mediates learning, while tonic dopamine release represents a no-go signal. Thus, the current dopamine therapy by providing dopamine precursor to alleviate PD motor symptoms is probably unable to mimic the delicate dopamine functions in the hippocampus, such as reward prediction error, and go/no-go signals. In addition, learning deficits in PD may vary with the timescale of hippocampal dopamine effects in different forms of learning and in different contexts. Although current optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations are powerful tools to identify key dopamine neural circuits that are causally related to learning-related behavior, dopamine release in the hippocampus induced by these manipulations could be quite different from the physiological level. Hence, it is critical to explore innovative methods for treating the learning deficits in PD that can precisely manipulate dopamine levels in the hippocampus and sensitively respond to physiological functions. Last, various neurotransmitters in the hippocampus are also involved in the dopamine regulation of learning. It is not clear how hippocampal dopamine dysfunction in PD patients affects its interaction with other transmitter systems. For example, dopamine release from the LC projecting to the hippocampus is likely to coordinate learning memory function in conjunction with norepinephrine. It is a significant challenge for future research to clarify the mechanisms by which complex synergies among multiple neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus that cause learning deficits in PD patients. In conclusion, hippocampal dopamine serves as a key regulator for learning capacity. The deterioration of major hippocampal dopamine sources in PD plays a crucial role in learning deficits and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Future research needs to focus on how to accurately mimic the physiological function of dopamine and the interaction of neurotransmitter systems during disease progression.",[],2023-9-22,Neural Regeneration Research,"""sti"""
11467660,"Harnessing science, technology, and innovation to drive synergy between climate goals and the SDGs",,"The United Nations passed two important resolutions, Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, in 2015 to change our world. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted as the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the goals. The overarching goal of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Science, technology, and innovation (STI) is one of the most prominent strategies promoted to aid SDG implementation. In this editorial, we provide specific mechanisms and strategies for STI to jointly promote climate change goals and SDGs. At the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world is lagging far behind the expected progress, triggered by and reinforcing poverty, inequality, hunger, disease, conflict, and disaster. Compared to 2019, countries have made little progress, and the world is still going in the wrong direction for food security, climate action, and biodiversity protection. Global GHG concentrations continue to rise, leading to record-breaking high global average temperatures. This trend increases the frequency of extreme weather events and accelerates the melting of glaciers and ice caps, causing rising sea levels and posing a threat to biodiversity. Human activities, principally through emissions of GHG, are responsible for global warming. Human development leads to rapid climate change, which in turn undermines human development. Climate goals and human development are interlinked. The SDG 13 that advocates for climate action is fundamentally consistent with climate goals. The status quo in development will bring about a climate and environment crisis, whereas focusing only on the climate goals and impeding development will bring about economic and social crises. The goal of sustainable development is to achieve both climate goals and SDGs. So, how can we meet this challenge and find the opportunity to achieve the two goals simultaneously? Climate change influences several SDG targets, but most of the interactions are synergies rather than trade-offs. Also, the trade-offs tend to be weaker than the synergies. Among the SDG targets that have trade-off relationships with climate goals, only four have evident trade-off interlinkages. To achieve the goals and targets, the 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report suggests deploying five “levers” to bring about transformation: governance, economy and finance, science and technology, individual and collective action, and capacity building. Paths for synergy between climate goals and SDGs Four curves with arrows represent the proposed paths for synergy. The current state is off track in both climate goals and SDGs. The ideal condition is that we can achieve both goals with the help of STI. If we only achieve one of the goals, we may face crises in society, economy, or environment. Developing efficient, zero-emission, and low-cost new energy and equipment is the key to achieving this synergy. The widespread use of fossil fuels is mainly due to their stability, reliability, and low cost. If the costs of new energy generation, with the help of STI and governmental initiatives, can be lower than traditional fossil fuels and are stable and reliable, then this will voluntarily drive manufacturing and consumer enterprises to switch to the new energy sources while simultaneously reducing industrial and economic development costs (SDG 12). At the same time, the production and maintenance of new energy equipment provide a large number of employment opportunities, and since the potential of solar and wind energy is highest in relatively remote areas, this would greatly promote poverty reduction (SDG 1). Fossil fuels are not only the main source of GHG emissions but also an important source of air, solid waste, and water pollution. Therefore, emission reduction has a natural synergistic effect with water pollution (target 6.3), air pollution (target 11.6), and soil pollution (target 12.4) reduction. The government can play a coordinating role by providing data support through STI, formulating efficient and consistent policies, and reducing the financial and social costs of implementing emissions reduction and pollution reduction separately. An example of synergy is the implementation of stringent air pollution control and GHG mitigation measures that could result in 40% of the global population being exposed to particulate matter levels below the air quality guideline set by the World Health Organization (WHO), with notable improvements in China, India, and the Middle East. Forests and grasslands on land, submerged plants in lakes, and mangroves, seaweed, and algae in the ocean all have ecological carbon sequestration capabilities, which can effectively reduce GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. At the same time, these areas are also the most diverse in terms of biodiversity. Therefore, the protection of these areas is essential. For example, some countries have already made afforestation plans for carbon sequestration in place around the globe. On one hand, there is an urgent need for scientific and technological advancements, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to provide more accurate early warning of disasters. On the other hand, when constructing new infrastructure or upgrading existing urban (SDG 11), agricultural (SDG 2), water conservancy (SDG 6), health (SDG 3), and other infrastructures, climate change factors should be fully considered. Moreover, due deliberation should be accorded to the potential occurrence of stronger natural disasters and warmer environments in the future. A few good examples to follow will be increasing the capacity of the sewage systems to cope with much higher flows (in the event of flooding), implementing technologies to cope with water scarcity like desalination and water treatment and reuse, etc. In addition to synergies between different goals, scientists, engineers, government administrators, financial investors, and all citizens also need to work together to reach synergism. The time left to combat the challenge of rapid climate change and its destructive impact on human development is limited. Whether one is optimistic or pessimistic, the most important thing is for us to accept the scientific facts, strive to stop climate change and achieve the SDGs through scientific and implementable methods, and be fully prepared to actively respond to the challenges of climate change in the short to medium term.

11467606,Assessing the Utility of a Patient-Facing Diagnostic Tool Among Individuals With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Focus Group Study,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and tissue fragility, is thought to be the most common inherited connective tissue disorder, with millions affected worldwide. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge that can impact quality of life for individuals with hEDS. Many with hEDS describe extended diagnostic odysseys involving exorbitant time and monetary investment. This delay is due to the complexity of diagnosis, symptom overlap with other conditions, and limited access to providers. Many primary care providers are unfamiliar with hEDS, compounded by genetics clinics that do not accept referrals for hEDS evaluation and long waits for genetics clinics that do evaluate for hEDS, leaving patients without sufficient options. This study explored the user experience, quality, and utility of a prototype of a patient-facing diagnostic tool intended to support clinician diagnosis for individuals with symptoms of hEDS. The questions included within the prototype are aligned with the 2017 international classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This study explored how this tool may help patients communicate information about hEDS to their physicians, influencing the diagnosis of hEDS and affecting patient experience. Participants clinically diagnosed with hEDS were recruited from either a medical center or private groups on a social media platform. Interested participants provided verbal consent, completed questionnaires about their diagnosis, and were invited to join an internet-based focus group to share their thoughts and opinions on a diagnostic tool prototype. Participants were invited to complete the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate their experience viewing the diagnostic tool. The MARS is a framework for evaluating mobile health apps across 4 dimensions: engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality. Qualitative data were analyzed using affinity mapping to organize information and inductively create themes that were categorized within the MARS framework dimensions to help identify strengths and weaknesses of the diagnostic tool prototype. In total, 15 individuals participated in the internet-based focus groups; 3 (20%) completed the MARS. Through affinity diagramming, 2 main categories of responses were identified, including responses related to the user interface and responses related to the application of the tool. Each category included several themes and subthemes that mapped well to the 4 MARS dimensions. The analysis showed that the tool held value and utility among the participants diagnosed with hEDS. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool stood out as a strength for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. The results provide insights on the perceived utility and value of the tool, including preferred phrasing, layout and design preferences, and tool accessibility. The participants expressed that the tool may improve the hEDS diagnostic odyssey and help educate providers about the diagnostic process.","Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of inherited disorders of connective tissue that result from impaired collagen synthesis throughout the body [ Descriptions of manifestations of EDS, including lax joints and skin findings, date back hundreds of years [ Historically, hEDS has been considered a rare condition, but there is more recent evidence suggesting that it is substantially more prevalent [ In addition to the inherent complexity of diagnosing a disorder with multisystem involvement and nonspecific symptoms (eg, chronic pain and fatigue), there are provider-related barriers to diagnosis for individuals with hEDS [ Limited accessibility to genetics specialists has, in some cases, resulted in genetics clinics declining to see patients referred for an hEDS evaluation [ Consultations with and referral to providers inexperienced with assessing for genetic forms of connective tissue disease are another barrier to a prompt and accurate diagnosis of hEDS [ Several web-based tools that assist in the diagnostic process have been developed in the genetic or rare disease domain [ Patient-facing diagnostic tools have potential to simplify and accelerate the diagnostic journey by raising awareness about the condition and diagnostic process. This could lead to more timely initiation of proper management strategies and improved patient outcomes. Evidence to support this comes from Lee et al [ The robust use of electronic health records, patient portals, and health-related websites has dramatically increased the amount and types of resources available to the public regarding their health. However, use of such digital tools comes with data security risks, and many health care applications do not meet privacy and security requirements [ Human-centered design (HCD) and design thinking are methods of innovation that focus on the needs of the human being, or the user or patient, to develop solutions to problems. HCD and design thinking use a variety of tools and methods to understand the problem being experienced by the person or population; identify possible solutions to those problems; and iteratively prototype, test, and refine those solutions [ The widespread use of smartphones has led to considerable growth in the development of mHealth apps. Consequently, several mHealth app evaluation frameworks have emerged to help patients and clinicians choose the most suitable and reliable app for their intended use [ Individuals with hEDS experience several different physical and somatic symptoms that substantially reduce their health-related quality of life [ Participants were recruited through two avenues: (1) private Facebook groups and (2) a clinical database of patients referred and evaluated for various pediatric and adult-onset genetics conditions, including hEDS, maintained at Geisinger Medical Center Department of Genetics and Genomics. This purposive sampling method was used to capture more diversity and include individuals both inside and outside the Geisinger service area. Geisinger is a large, integrated community-based health system that serves central, south central, and northeast Pennsylvania with robust medical and research genetics programs. It serves a large rural and stable patient population [ A social media post advertising the study opportunity was posted by a study team member (JG) on the EDS Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes Health Advocacy Program private Facebook group and the Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos or Chiari Support Group for Central PA private Facebook group. In total, 2 postings were made on each Facebook group spaced approximately 3 weeks apart. The post provided the email address of JG so that anyone who viewed the advertisement and was interested could receive additional information. A total of 10 individuals who viewed the Facebook post requested additional study information. In addition, participants were identified for the study through Geisinger’s Department of Genetics and Genomics clinical database. A patient list was exported from the database of patients seen in the clinic between September 2019 and September 2021 who were evaluated for hEDS. Patients were excluded from the research if, after chart review, they did not meet the criteria for hEDS following a clinical genetics evaluation. Eligible patients were contacted by study personnel up to 3 times either by telephone or through a patient message on the Geisinger patient portal during a 3-week recruitment period. A telephone script or advertisement were used to introduce the study. Those interested in learning more were sent additional information through encrypted email or the secure patient portal. A total of 12 patients from Geisinger expressed interest and requested additional study information. All participants were required to have a clinical diagnosis of hEDS, be aged ≥18 years, and read and speak fluent English. Study staff privately emailed information about the hEDS diagnostic prototype tool, the goals of the study, a demographic questionnaire, and a questionnaire asking about the diagnostic experience to those who enrolled in the study. Participants were offered 3 focus group times; 2 were offered in the evening and 1 was offered at midday. Recruitment ended after holding 2 focus groups, when theoretical sufficiency was achieved and the authors thought that there was enough breadth and depth of participant data to effectively address the research objectives [ The study was waived as human participant research by both the Geisinger and Sarah Lawrence College institutional review boards (IRBs). All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from participants using a written consent letter approved by the IRB (Geisinger IRB 2021-0394), which specified that return of the demographic questionnaire implied consent. The research protocol and all study materials, scripts, and advertisements were reviewed by the Geisinger IRB and determined to meet criteria for exemption as defined under category 2 in the US Department of Health and Human Services regulations for the protection of human participants in research. As such, no formal informed consent process was required. However, all participants were provided with an information form regarding the research and were asked to indicate whether they understood that no identifying or contact information would be shared outside of the research team, that participation was voluntary, and that all research data would be kept anonymous and private. No compensation was offered to participants. All participants were asked to agree to keep the focus group discussions private and not share what was discussed after leaving the focus group. To protect the privacy of research participants, all study-related data were deidentified and assigned a unique research identifier, and all survey responses were anonymous. The focus groups were conducted by 3 or 4 members of the study team, with one member facilitating the internet-based virtual focus group (VFG), another documenting during a brainstorming exercise, and the remaining study team members taking notes and monitoring the chat. All study team members were female. In total, 2 were genetic counseling graduate students (AK and NL) at the time of the study, one was a population health sciences researcher (KR), and one was a senior research genetic counselor (JG) with a clinical interest in EDS and a history of helping establish an hEDS specialty genetics clinic at her workplace. The latter 2 team members had extensive previous experience with qualitative research and trained the student members of the research team. Study team members had no previous relationship with the participants before this study. We conducted 2 VFGs using the Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Corp) videoconference platform. To ensure privacy, a link was sent to participants individually, and participants were asked to join from a private area. Study team members participated from a private room in their homes. Participants were admitted from the Microsoft Teams waiting room into the VFG, were asked to share only first names, and had the option to have their web camera on or off. A total of 8 participants attended the first VFG, which lasted 1 hour and 28 minutes. A total of 62% (5/8) of the participants opted to have their camera on during this focus group session. In total, 7 participants attended the second VFG, which lasted 1 hour and 32 minutes. Of these 7 participants, 4 (57%) opted to have their camera on during this session. One participant had audiovisual complications and used the chat feature to share all feedback. At the start of the VFG, ground rules were reviewed (eg, privacy of the discussion, respect for fellow attendees, and turn taking or participation), and a member of the study team announced that recording of the VFG would begin (using the Microsoft Teams recording feature). Participants were asked to share their motivation to take part in the study. A script akin to an interview guide developed by the research team was used to guide discussion on aspects of the usability, usefulness, and acceptability of the tool and began with a demonstration of the tool via the screen sharing feature. The VFG leader (JG) presented a hypothetical individual with some symptoms of hEDS and walked the participants through how the individual answered the questions within the tool by showing wireframes of the tool prototype. After the demonstration, the Rose, Thorn, Bud design thinking method was used to assess participant reactions to the tool [ In addition to discussion, participants used the chat feature and were invited to include additional thoughts in a postinterview survey via an anonymous web-based form. Verbatim transcripts were created from the Microsoft Teams recording. Transcripts, chat logs, and postinterview surveys from VFGs were reviewed, deidentified, and given a study ID. Transcripts and surveys were reviewed for additional roses, thorns, and buds and other remarks that were missed during the VFGs. These new ideas were also color coded based on “rose, thorn, bud” status to stay organized and added as sticky notes to the Miro board. Notes and focus group recordings were stored on Geisinger’s secure Microsoft Teams portal. Participants who attended the VFGs were privately recontacted via email and invited to complete the MARS. Those who expressed interest were emailed a PDF of the MARS, a PDF document that contained all questions used on the diagnostic tool, screenshots of the landing page ( The landing page for the prototype of a patient-facing digital tool to facilitate diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is shown in this figure. It includes a disclaimer, the expected time needed to complete the tool, what will be needed to complete the tool, who the tool is intended for, and what the tool will produce. Using a phenomenological approach, data analysis involved qualitative content analysis using affinity mapping to create a visual codebook used to code the transcripts. Content analysis allowed for reduction of concepts into key categories [ Note taking and data clustering into categories based on affinity occurred in two steps: (1) in real time as a member of our research team (KMR) typed web-based sticky notes during the VFGs and (2) after the VFGs, when brainstorming by writing down ideas extrapolated from transcripts, recordings, chat history, and postinterview surveys on web-based sticky notes. Next, the study team met to review the notes from the Miro board and discussed which notes shared similar themes and should be grouped together. Ongoing discussion with team members was vital to clarify and talk through conflicts regarding how the notes should be grouped and how to name the themes and subthemes. As 2 authors had personal experience with (potential) EDS diagnoses within their families and felt that patient education needs to be enhanced, reflexivity was practiced ensuring that the interpretation of the data remained objective and true to the experiences and shared thoughts of the participants [ The flow of the affinity mapping process that was used in this study starting from ideas shared during focus groups and ending with qualitative coding of focus group transcripts. VFG: virtual focus group. To visualize what changes and improvements were of highest priority to address for the diagnostic tool, a 2 × 2 prioritization grid was developed in Miro with the x-axis as lift (how much work the change will take) and the y-axis as importance (how many times this was mentioned in the focus group). Finally, the themes and subthemes were mapped to the MARS dimensions of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information to facilitate understanding of the qualitative data. Regarding quantitative data, respondents returned the MARS survey, and a member of the study team (JG) scored each one. The MARS total mean score was calculated to ascertain the overall quality of the diagnostic tool, and subscale scores were calculated and compared across participants to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the prototype. A total of 16 people agreed to participate in the VFGs; 1 (6%) was a no-show. Of the 15 participants, 13 (87%) completed the pre–focus group questionnaires, 13 (87%) self-identified as White and non-Hispanic, 12 (80%) identified as female, and 1 (7%) identified as male. This aligns with studies that note an excess of affected female individuals [ Reported demographics and diagnostic experience of participants with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) who took part in focus groups intended to capture their thoughts about and responses to a prototype of an hEDS diagnostic tool (N=15) Two main categories of responses to the tool prototype became apparent through the affinity diagramming process: (1) responses related to the user interface and (2) responses related to the application of the tool. These categories each include several themes and subthemes, which were mapped to 1 of the 4 dimensions or MARS subscales (esthetics, functionality, engagement, and information) assessed using the MARS evaluation framework.  Categories, themes, and subthemes identified through affinity mapping and mapped to corresponding Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) dimensions, which was used as a framework to determine whether the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome diagnosis tool prototype addresses the needs and goals for which it was created and highlight specific strengths and weaknesses of the app The MARS defines esthetics as “graphic design, overall visual appeal, color scheme, and stylistic consistency” [ “Tool design” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the esthetics” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) The MARS defines functionality as “app functioning, easy to learn, navigation, flow logics and gestural design of app” [ “Phrasing” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the functionality dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) “Communication with providers” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the functionality dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) Regarding the “Accessing the tool” theme, 2 subthemes were identified that mapped to the functionality dimension on the MARS:  The  The MARS defines engagement as “fun, interesting, customizable, interactive, well-targeted to the audience” [ “Diversity and inclusion” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the engagement” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) The MARS defines information as “high quality information from a credible source” [ “Diagnostic process” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the information” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) “Results” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the information dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) Of the 15 VFG participants who were invited to complete the MARS, 3 (20%) returned the rating scale for scoring. The scores for each dimension per participant are shown in  The scores the participants provided for each dimension of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS)—mean scores (could range from 1 to 5) of the engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality objective subscales and overall mean app quality score per participant App subjective quality scores reported by the 3 participants App-specific rating scale scores reported by the 3 participants At the beginning of both focus groups, each participant was invited to share their motivations to take part in the study. Although not part of our assessment of the tool, this yielded rich insights into the hEDS diagnostic experience. Many participants shared difficulties they faced in the process of being diagnosed. Their struggles motivated them to be involved in research to improve the diagnostic process for others and increase awareness. Some participants also mentioned that this study’s purpose aligned with their personal goals and values. On the topic of personal experience, participants discussed money spent, years to receive a diagnosis, and feeling invalidated by medical professionals. One participant shared that they had spent US $10,000 in a year for their diagnosis. Another shared that they were diagnosed after 20 years, during which they saw ≥200 physicians and spent approximately US $100,000. One mentioned that it took so long to receive a diagnosis that they wanted to help others so that they did not have to experience the same diagnostic odyssey. One participant shared that their diagnosis journey involved a “vicious game of connecting the dots for over 30 years.” Some participants voiced that they were sick of medical gaslighting, for example, being accused of being drug seeking or labeled as crazy, lazy, or stupid by medical professionals. One participant shared that they were adopted; the lack of family history made their diagnostic odyssey extremely frustrating and emotionally exhausting. Some participants discussed their personal goals and values and how that led them to joining the focus group. One participant shared that they took any opportunity to help the EDS or rare disease communities. Some mentioned that they were active in the EDS and disability communities and wanted to support research. Other participants were passionate about knowing the importance of good data and information in the hEDS community, as well as being involved in hEDS medical education. Increasing awareness of hEDS is one goal that was shared among participants. Participants mentioned that there needs to be more patient rights, more resources, and more EDS-specific practitioners. One participant shared that it is hard to be diagnosed and find resources to determine whether being diagnosed is worthwhile. Another shared that they were newly diagnosed and they wanted to be able to better inform their physicians about EDS. The need to educate providers about hEDS can feel uncomfortable; improving provider awareness motivated some to participate in this research. After reviewing transcripts from the VFGs, we were able to identify the strengths of the tool from the perspective of the hEDS patient community and understand the aspects of the tool that need to be readdressed. We learned that the concept of a patient-facing tool held value and utility among the participants and that the simple, chatbot-style format was acceptable and user-friendly. The VFG participants confirmed what is found in the literature regarding long diagnostic odysseys for patients with hEDS. Their stories and experiences clearly support the need for improved communication between individuals with hEDS and health care providers, specifically as they search for a diagnosis. Their responses suggest that this tool has the potential to address this issue, possibly saving users time, money, and energy spent during their diagnostic odysseys and motivating users of the tool to receive an accurate diagnosis. There were several insightful suggestions for areas of improvement. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool was seen as the most promising piece for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. Given that some participants were concerned that individuals with other forms of EDS may be misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed after using the diagnostic tool, listing key symptoms (eg, major diagnostic criteria) for other forms of EDS to flag potential differential diagnoses was highly endorsed. Several participants offered suggestions of symptoms to be included in a checklist to expand on both common hEDS comorbidities and on symptoms of other forms of EDS and connective tissue disease. Several participants also suggested including a comment section for adding other symptoms or information to augment communication between patients and providers. As individuals with hEDS often have many seemingly unrelated symptoms, this list could help providers and users alike keep track of symptoms. Participants also endorsed adding resource links to the ending summary sheet, which could help users educate themselves on hEDS. These important suggestions indicate that both empowering patients to communicate with their providers and educating providers about hEDS were seen as equally important for improving the diagnostic process. We envision being able to use these comments to expand what can be entered into a future app to include a section where users can record symptoms, comorbidities, and medications. In addition, current, authoritative resources can be linked within the app. Language regarding the exclusion of differential diagnoses, which was very important within our study cohort, can also be added. The participants’ responses during the VFGs suggested that there were some concerns about the ability of the tool to accurately flag individuals with hEDS. As the questions in the tool are based on the 2017 diagnostic criteria, some of these concerns might point to a larger issue with the diagnostic criteria themselves. In line with this concern, the Toronto GoodHope EDS Clinic conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of the 2017 diagnostic criteria [ The depth and diversity of suggestions on the user interface imply that this is an important component of the user’s experience with the tool. Word choice was a frequently mentioned area for improvement. Although the word choice for the questions on the tool was intended to be consistent with the 2017 diagnostic criteria yet adapted to be patient facing, participants had many suggestions for areas where the word choices were confusing and medical jargon could be clarified, making the tool more accessible to the general population. Recommendations for text-to-speech capability and the inclusion of alternate text describing images were also made. The language used regarding sex and gender was suggested to be updated and clarified. Asking for “sex assigned at birth” rather than “sex at birth” and including an option for “other” was one suggestion from participants to improve the precision and the inclusivity of the tool. This wording, in addition to rephrasing some other items, has already been incorporated ( This is an example of the first page of a multipage printable summary sheet that would be produced from answering the questions on the app. Users can opt to share it with their medical provider to facilitate discussion about their symptoms in relation to the diagnostic criteria for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Participants offered many suggestions for improvements to the images used in the tool. Showing degrees of variability and images comparing someone with hEDS versus someone without could add further clarification. Including images of more diverse bodies could also help ensure that users of all skin tones and body types could easily recognize manifestations of hEDS on their own bodies. This would ultimately improve the clarity and inclusivity of the tool and combat stereotypes of what individuals with hEDS look like. Another aspect of the user interface that drew comments involved the design and functionality of the tool. Although the chatbot format was seen as a positive attribute, it limits functionality. The participants suggested that a back button or skip logic could make the tool easier to use. Other aspects of design, such as colors and icons, were more controversial, and it is unlikely that any design choice will please all users. User feedback has been considered, and an app with more functionality and flexibility is planned. The participants’ responses on where to house the tool suggest that it would be best to have the tool available in many places both on the internet and in person. Advertising the tool via pamphlets or brochures in certain physicians’ offices was suggested during the VFGs. Housing the tool solely on the web, on the Ehlers-Danlos Society website specifically, for example, may limit the number of people who could benefit from it. As participants pointed out, many have limited access to the internet or spend little time on the web. For those who do spend time on the web, they might only find the tool on the EDS website if they are already familiar with EDS, limiting its usefulness. To ensure that the tool is widely accessible, participants suggested workshopping good search engine optimization terms and making the tool usable on both mobile and desktop. They also suggested having professional or medical society backing to add more validity and help ensure that providers would be receptive to users’ results. Scoring the returned MARS surveys indicated that the EDS diagnostic tool prototype was moderately highly to highly rated among our respondents, which echoed the qualitative analysis findings. App quality scores showed that the tool was easy to navigate, functioned well, and was moderately to highly visually appealing. This is consistent with qualitative data gathered from the VFGs, where most participants liked the easy flow and chatbot style of the tool and felt that the design was pleasing. On the basis of the items assessing engagement (eg, interactivity, interest, target group, customization, and entertainment), respondents were moderately engaged with the app. One participant noted within the engagement subscale that the app is not intended to be used for entertainment, and they rated it accordingly. Another respondent noted within this subscale that it is not necessary to customize this app for its intended use. As the diagnostic tool is not meant to entertain or be interactive, a moderate engagement score is not surprising. There were differences among survey respondents on the subscale assessing information quality, making it challenging to draw conclusions from the small cohort of respondents. This, in part, stemmed from a MARS item assessing where the app was developed (eg, an academic center or a company); this is not clear on the prototype, nor was it discussed in the VFGs. A future version of the tool would need to clearly indicate the developer. Another question with divergent responses regarded whether the content of the app was well written. While 67% (2/3) of the respondents highly endorsed this item, 33% (1/3) of the respondents indicated that they did not like how some questions were addressed to the patient, whereas other questions were addressed to a provider. Although most questions in the EDS diagnostic tool were structured to be patient facing, the phrasing of a few items was kept as provider facing to be consistent with the published questionnaire by Hakim and Graham [ The MARS app subjective quality scores indicated that the tool had a high satisfaction rating, and respondents valued the tool enough to warrant recommending it to others. This reflects discussion during the IFGs where participants indicated they would be likely to recommend the tool to a friend with signs of EDS. Within the subjective quality subscale, when asked whether respondents would pay for the app, 67% (2/3) responded “no,” whereas 33% (1/3) responded “maybe.” On the item assessing repeated use of the app, a lower score was endorsed by most respondents, with 67% (2/3) noting that the tool is not intended for repeated use. The app subjective quality scores indicated that the respondents feel that others could benefit from the app but do not feel that they would pay for the app. This may reflect that the app is intended to be a 1-time use experience, and consumers may not feel that this warrants payment. In addition, during the VFGs, we discussed that the app was intended to be available on a website, such as the Ehlers-Danlos Society site, which may have led respondents to believe or feel that the tool should be free. The app-specific rating scale scores showed overwhelmingly that the respondents felt that the EDS diagnostic tool would likely increase the knowledge surrounding the diagnostic process for hEDS. Scores indicated that the tool would encourage users to continue to seek help to obtain a correct diagnosis. Most respondents felt that use of the tool would increase the likelihood of receiving an accurate diagnosis and would increase awareness of the importance of properly assessing for hEDS. Interestingly, when asked to rate whether the tool is likely to change attitudes toward improving the diagnostic process for hEDS, 67% (2/3) of the respondents highly endorsed this item, whereas 33% (1/3) noted that they were uncertain of whether a diagnostic tool or app can change the attitude of health care providers because some simply “don’t believe in” hEDS. Participants were recruited to this study because they had diagnoses of hEDS, although the sample is not representative of all individuals diagnosed with hEDS, especially given our homogeneous sample. This may affect how transferrable their responses are to a wider audience. Most participants also reported feeling generally comfortable reading health care materials, and some were part of advocacy groups or reported being highly involved in work surrounding hEDS. As such, our sample may be more informed on hEDS than the average user of the diagnostic tool and more inclined toward using a digital tool. Further testing is needed with a general-population user group. Focus groups are a group-based technique subject to group bias effect [ Regarding the MARS, technically, the scale is not intended for use on a static prototype, although we felt that using the MARS as a basis to improve the quality of a future EDS diagnostic tool was acceptable. In addition, because survey respondents were not trained on how to use the MARS, it is possible that respondents did not accurately or consistently rate items on the MARS. Finally, it could have been beneficial to have additional respondents to the MARS survey to ensure that the needs and goals for which the tool was created were on target and highlight additional strengths and weaknesses. Despite this, having qualitative data that assessed user experience from 2 VFGs likely allowed us to capture most themes surrounding the utility, feasibility, acceptability, and need for a diagnostic hEDS tool. According to a 2017 study, 80% of themes are discoverable within 2 to 3 focus groups, whereas 90% are discoverable within 3 to 6 focus groups [ Research is underway to identify the genetic etiology of hEDS. In the meantime, this study could lead to further research on current EDS diagnostic criteria and the need to enhance the diagnostic process. On a larger scale, further research is needed into barriers to care for individuals with hEDS and the impacts of this on quality of life. Finally, it is important to investigate whether patient-facing digital tools could be beneficial for individuals seeking diagnoses for other genetic or medical conditions that rely on clinical diagnoses and whether access to a diagnostic tool could improve accurate application of diagnostic criteria. For example, fibromyalgia may be an interesting candidate for a similar tool given the lack of objective markers and availability of diagnostic criteria [ Since the conclusion of this research, the prototype of the EDS diagnosis tool has been presented to the Ehlers-Danlos Society. Given the shared goal of improving the diagnosis of those with EDS, this has led to a collaboration. A project envisioned by the Ehlers-Danlos Society has been undertaken by some of the world’s leading experts on EDS to generate and publish the diagnostic pathways for the EDSs. An mHealth app similar but more extensive than the prototype used in this research is in the process of being developed to detail these diagnostic pathways in electronic form and will include both patient- and provider-facing sections. We are anticipating using React, which is an extensible, mature JavaScript, to build the user interface. In alignment with the desire voiced by participants in the VFGs to record their potential symptoms of EDS, the web-based tool will include a patient-centered section with a symptom diary, a medication reminder feature, and a social platform to allow for connections among users. Assessing the use of this diagnostic tool from the perspective of individuals diagnosed with hEDS has highlighted how it could be useful for individuals searching for an explanation for their potential hEDS-related symptoms. Suggestions and improvements were offered to optimize the tool before public release. Participants indicated that the tool may help individuals be diagnosed more easily, save time and money, help educate providers, and overall improve the diagnostic odyssey of hEDS. While they offered detailed suggestions for improvement, their overall feedback was positive and enthusiastic about the concept of the tool in general and expressed their desire to see it become available to patients. Recommended changes include altering the technical and visual design, incorporating more diverse language and images, and simplifying wording and medical terminology while consistently being patient facing. These suggestions will aid the process of finalizing a diagnostic tool and may, ultimately, help facilitate a diagnosis for individuals with hEDS.","['diagnostic tool', 'hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome', 'patient experiences', 'diagnostic odyssey', 'affinity mapping', 'mobile health app', 'mobile phone']",2024-9-26,JMIR Formative Research,"""sti"""
11467458,Dual-dispatch protocols and return of spontaneous circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide observational study,"The Korean National Fire Agency conducted a pilot project examining Advanced Life Support (ALS) protocols, including epinephrine administration, to improve survival among patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the Korean National Fire Agency ALS protocol on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with OHCA. This study included patients with adult-presumed cardiac arrest between January and December 2020. The main factor of interest was ambulance type according to ALS protocol, which was divided into dedicated ALS ambulance (DA), smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS), and non-DA, and the main analysis factor was prehospital ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. During the study period, a total of 18,031 adult patients with OHCA was treated by the emergency medical services, including 7,520 DAs (41.71%), 2,622 SALSs (14.54%), and 7,889 non-DAs (43.75%). The prehospital ROSC rate of the DA group (13.19%) was higher than those of the non-DA group (7.91%) and the SALS group (11.17%, P<0.01). Compared with that of the DA group, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for prehospital ROSC were 0.97 (0.82–1.15) in the SALS group and 0.57 (0.50–0.65) in the non-DA group. ALS protocol intervention was associated with prehospital ROSC rates. Therefore, continuous efforts to promote systemic implementation of the ALS protocol to improve OHCA outcomes are necessary.","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with low survival rates, and is a major public health problem [ In addition to rapid BLS [ These EMS resuscitation protocols can affect the rate and timing of resuscitation of patients with OHCA provided by EMS crews [ This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy (No. 2022-0048-001). The requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. An observational study was performed by the Korean National Fire Agency (NFA) using the OHCA registry. The NFA operates a single EMS system across the country, with 18 provincial offices targeting more than 50 million people in an area of 100,210 km There are three types of ALS-provided ambulances differentiated by protocols. The first type is a smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS). Since 2015, this protocol has been implemented in selected areas (four cities and provinces, 31 of 224 fire departments nationwide, covering 23.9% of the total population). The SALS protocol requires two ambulances and enables real-time feedback from EMS physicians using video calls as well as the use of a manual defibrillator and administration of ALS medications such as epinephrine and amiodarone [ The second type is a dedicated ALS ambulance (DA) consisting of two or more qualified EMS crews. This nationwide EMS intervention was initiated based on evidence that a better trained and experienced EMS crew can improve outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest [ The EMS crews in these DAs received 3 days of Advanced Cardiac Life Support training, enhancing their capability for handling complex emergencies. DA teams are dispatched with priority in cases of OHCA and are permitted to use epinephrine under direct medical oversight via video calls as part of a nationwide pilot project. When the dispatch center recognizes cardiac arrest, they dispatch the DA with priority, followed by another ambulance for a multitier response. Specifically, the DA protocol allows the initiation of AAM and epinephrine administration even in the absence of a second ambulance when a fire engine (acting as a BLS team) is on scene. This is a significant protocol advantage over SALS, which requires the presence of two ambulances for ALS interventions ( OHCA data were drawn from the NFA EMS system database in Korea, which includes EMS activity, cardiac arrest, and EMS dispatch center information. The details of this database have been reported in previous studies [ This study included patients with OHCA aged >18 years with a presumed cardiac etiology treated by EMS crews between January 2020 and December 2020. We included individuals irrespective of prehospital ALS. Patients who had not undergone resuscitation or were witnessed by the EMS crew and a single ambulance dispatch were excluded from the analysis. The primary analytical factor was prehospital ROSC that was maintained until hospital arrival. The secondary analysis factors were the rates of AAM, IV, and epinephrine administration, defined as ALS. The following variables were recorded: (1) demographic factors of age and sex; (2) community factors of season, metropolitan area (patients categorized based on residential location, including 10 metropolitan cities and nine provinces), place (public, private, and other), witnessed, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and defibrillation; and (3) EMS factors of response time interval (RTI; from the time of the call to the time when the first vehicle arrives at the site), scene time interval (STI; from the time the first vehicle arrives at the site to the time the patient transport vehicle leaves the site), transport time interval (from the time of departure from the site to the time of arrival at the patient transport vehicle hospital), field primary electrocardiogram (shockable [ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia], pulseless electrical activity, and asystole), prehospital airway management (bag valve mask, endotracheal intubation, and supraglottic airway), advanced airway timing (from arrival time at the site to success time of advanced airway), EMS defibrillation, IV and epinephrine administration, epinephrine administration timing (from arrival time at the site to time of epinephrine administration), and ROSC upon arrival at the emergency department. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences among groups. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median and quintile, and statistical tests were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationships between key variables and study results and to adjust for potential disturbance factors. Model I was adjusted for demographic factors (age and sex). Model II was adjusted for model I demographic factors, community factors (season, witness, cardiac arrest location, metropolitan area, and bystander CPR), RTI, STI, initial electrocardiogram rhythms, and epinephrine administration. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the key variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver. 5.2 (SAS Institute Inc). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Among 31,651 patients with OHCA treated by EMS between January and December 2020, 18,031 adult patients (56.97%) were included in the study. The number of patients transferred by group was 2,622 SALS, 7,520 DA, and 7,889 non-DA ( The median age was 74 years for SALS, 73 years for DA, and 74 years for non-DA (P=0.09). The DA group included the largest number of metropolitan residents (SALS, 18.31%; DA, 56.58%; and non-DA, 39.83%; P<0.01). Public places were the highest location of response in the non-DA group (SALS, 9.57%; DA, 10.25%; and non-DA, 11.81%; P<0.01). Witnessed cases were highest in the non-DA group (SALS, 44.77%; DA, 43.34%; and non-DA, 44.78%; P<0.01) and bystander CPR cases were highest in the SALS group (SALS, 69.45%; DA, 65.85%; and non-DA, 67.22%; P<0.01) ( Prehospital ROSC was the highest in the DA group (SALS, 11.17%; DA, 13.19%; and non-DA, 7.91%; P<0.01). In multivariable logistic regression model Ⅰ after adjusting for age and sex, the SALS and non-DA groups were associated with lower prehospital ROSC compared with the DA group (SALS: aOR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72–0.96]; non-DA: aOR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.51–0.63]). In model II, after adjusting for all other confounders, there was no significant difference in the SALS group, and the non-DA group was associated with lower prehospital ROSC (SALS: aOR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.82–1.15]; non-DA: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.50–0.65]) ( For ALS, in regression model Ⅰ, the SALS and non-DA groups were associated with lower provision of AAM (SALS: aOR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58–0.79]; non-DA: aOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.62–0.78]), IV (SALS: aOR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.43–0.52]; non-DA: aOR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.38–0.43]), and epinephrine (SALS: aOR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46–0.55]; non-DA: aOR, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.08–0.10]) compared with the DA. In model Ⅱ, even after adjusting for all other confounders, the results were similar ( Regarding the prehospital ALS rate, the DA group provided AAM at a higher rate (SALS, 89.70%; DA, 92.75%; and non-DA, 89.91%; P<0.01), and the median (interquartile range, IQR) time interval from EMS arrival at the scene to the application of AAM was similar in the three groups (6 minutes). DA showed the highest provision rate of IV (SALS, 45.77%; DA, 63.88%; and non-DA, 41.65%) and epinephrine (SALS, 31.50%; DA, 47.77%; and non-DA, 7.40%) ( The cumulative rate of prehospital epinephrine at 60 minutes was the highest in the DA group (epinephrine timing, 19 minutes) followed by the SALS and non-DA groups (epinephrine timing, both 21 minutes) ( The DA group had a slightly faster RTI (7 minutes [IQR, 6–9 minutes]) than that of the SALS group (8 minutes [IQR, 7–11 minutes]) and the non-DA group (8 minutes [IQR, 6–11 minutes]). The DA group (17 minutes [IQR, 14–21 minutes]) and the SALS group (18 minutes [IQR, 14–22 minutes]) had a longer STI than that of the non-DA group (14 minutes [IQR, 12–18 minutes]; P<0.01). The rate of use of defibrillation was highest in DA (SALS, 19.72%; DA, 21.57%; non-DA, 20.18%; P=0.04) ( This nationwide observational study was conducted in Korea. When a DA is dispatched, there is a higher rate of prehospital ROSC and provision of prehospital ALS, such as AAM, IV, and epinephrine, than for other protocols. Depending on the nature and circumstances of EMS, benefits may vary as well as their effects on patient outcomes [ Early ALS response was associated with improved survival in a recent ALS study [ The strength of this observational study is that it investigated the effects of a new EMS protocol and operation implemented in Korea at the national level. To improve OHCA results, Korea has implemented interventions such as DA and EMS [ In our analysis, the DA group exhibited a higher rate of advanced AAM application compared to both SALS and non-DA groups. Notably, the time to administer AAM did not significantly differ across these groups, indicating that the efficiency of these EMS protocols is consistent across models. This suggests that EMS protocol implementation effectively standardizes care delivery without delaying interventions, showcasing its potential to enhance patient outcomes in OHCA scenarios ( When designing an EMS system, various considerations are needed to improve EMS quality. To improve prehospital ROSC and ALS rates, there is a need to increase performance skills and self-efficacy through appropriate staffing of EMS providers and systematic training. In addition, it is necessary to maintain the experience of ALS providers to improve higher-risk ALS capabilities. Therefore, the operation of a DA-type EMS for patients with OHCA with high dispatch frequency can be especially effective [ This study has several limitations. First, this was a natural experimental study rather than a randomized controlled trial [ In conclusion, ALS protocol interventions were associated with differences in prehospital ROSC rates. All societies should do their best to improve the survival of patients with cardiac arrest based on local characteristics.","['Advanced Cardiac Life Support', 'Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'Emergency medical services', 'Return of spontaneous circulation', 'Epinephrine']",2024-4-5,Clinical and Experimental Emergency Medicine,"""sti"""
11466795,Iron overload regulates cognitive function in rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy by inducing an increase in frontal butyrylcholinesterase activity,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of iron overload on acetylcholinesterase activity in the frontal lobe tissue of rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and its relation to cognitive ability. By elucidating the potential mechanisms of cognitive impairment, this study may offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for MHE. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased and randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group with six rats in each group. Following the induction of MHE, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) was utilized to assess spatial orientation and memory capacity. Subsequently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were performed to capture Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) images of all rats' heads. Compared to the control group rats, the MHE model rats showed significantly reduced learning and memory capabilities as well as spatial orientation abilities ( The changes in BuChE activity in frontal lobe extract may be related to changes in spatial orientation and behavioral changes in MHE, and iron overload in the frontal lobe tissue may regulate changes in BuChE activity, BuChE levels appear to be iron-dependent.","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication characterized by cognitive decline and abnormal neurologic function, with high prevalence worldwide (Bernal et al.,  Recent studies have linked defects in the brain neurotransmitter system, particularly glutamate and monoaminergic mechanisms, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin systems, to the occurrence of MHE in animal models and liver disease patients (Hamdani et al.,  The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in specific behavioral responses and cognitive processes (Berlot et al.,  Therefore, this study aims to explore potential changes in blood serum and brain tissue BuChE activity and its relationship with cognitive function under the background of MHE in model rats and determine whether BuChE activity changes are related to iron overload. We hypothesize that abnormal iron accumulation in the MHE brain region induces increased BuChE expression, which consumes the neurotransmitter ACh through a bypass pathway, thereby accelerating cognitive impairment in the MHE brain cholinergic system. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 weeks, 200–260 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Ningxia Medical University. After 1 week of acclimation, the animals were randomly assigned to experimental ( The timeline for the entire experimental process. The Morris water maze (MWM) consists of a circular pool measuring 200.0 cm × 200.0 cm × 55.0 cm, filled with water to a depth of 37.0 cm with an escape platform located 2.0 cm below the water surface. The water temperature was maintained at 22 ± 2°C. To minimize external factors' potential confounding effects on the experimental animals, the pool was surrounded by canvas, whilst plastic boards with varying shapes were affixed to the walls in the east, south, west, and north directions to assist the rats in orientating themselves and determining their location. Place navigation test: The experiment consisted of 5 days, with four training sessions per day. At the start of each session, rats were introduced into the water from any point on the wall facing the pool. Their swimming trajectories and times were recorded using a SMART 3.0 computer video tracking system (Panlab, Spain). The average score of the four daily training sessions was used to evaluate the learning performance of the rats. Throughout the experiment, all rats had to locate and remain on the escape platform for 10 s within a 60-s timeframe. If the rat failed to reach the platform within 60 s, it was placed on the platform for 10 s before the next trial. Spatial exploration test: On the sixth day, the escape platform was removed, and all rats were allowed to swim freely in the MWM for 60 s. The SMART 3.0 computer video tracking system automatically recorded the behavioral indices of the rats in the maze (time spent in the target quadrant and number of times crossing the target quadrant), and the behavioral performance of all rats was observed. On the day of MRI data acquisition, isoflurane (induction 5%, maintenance 2%, oxygen flow rate 1.5 L/min) was utilized to anesthetize the rats. Subsequently, all rats underwent imaging using a GE Architect 3.0T MR scanner equipped with a dedicated rat coil. To prevent image quality degradation and motion artifacts caused by head movement during scanning, the tails and heads of the rats were secured using medical tape and sponge pads before the experiment. The rats' condition was continuously monitored throughout the scan. Before the QSM scans, routine sequence scans were performed to exclude rats with brain lesions. QSM data acquisition was performed using a 3D gradient-echo (GRE) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 100.4 ms/8 ms, flip angle = 12°, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, slice spacing = 1.0 mm, FOV = 80 × 80 mm. Data post-processing: The raw images were transferred to a personal computer in DICOM format using RadiAnt DICOM Viewer software ( The day after the QSM data acquisition, blood was drawn from the tail vein to assess the RBC count (BC-2800vet, Mindray, China). Rats were euthanized after blood collection, and frontal cortex and liver tissues were rapidly harvested on ice. Fix the frontal cortex and liver tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde, stain with iron, and quantify iron deposits using Eclipse Ci-L microscopy and Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Calculate iron deposition as the pixel area of iron ion precipitation/field of view pixel area  Subsequently, the tissue sample was subjected to a wash step with pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH = 7.4) to eliminate residual blood content before being weighed. Next, physiological saline solution (0.9%) was added to the tissue sample at a predetermined weight-to-volume ratio of 1:9. Afterward, the sample underwent mechanical homogenization in an ice-cold water bath at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the soluble components was collected for further experimentation as per the instructions stipulated by the manufacturer. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-26.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.5 software (GraphPad Software, USA). Prior to statistical testing, we assessed the normality of all data using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For normally distributed continuous variables, we employed the  We evaluated the temporal changes in spatial learning ability in all rats using the place navigation test. A statistically significant reduction in latency period (time to reach the original platform) was observed in the HC group as the number of training sessions increased, with a significant difference noted between the fourth and fifth days ( MWM latency time of rats in two groups. On the sixth day of the experiment, we conducted a spatial probe test to assess the rats' spatial orientation and memory abilities. We found that the MHE group had significantly fewer crossings than the HC group ( Spatial memory performance of HC and MHE groups.  We assessed BuChE activity in the serum and frontal lobe tissue of HC and MHE groups. Our results show that BuChE activity in the serum of MHE group was significantly lower than that of the HC group ( BuChE activity in the peripheral and central of HC and MHE groups.  The frontal lobe susceptibility values of HC and MHE groups.  Brown granules indicative of iron was visible in the MHE frontal cortex stained with DAB-enhanced Prussian blue ( DAB-enhanced Prussian blue staining of HC and MHE groups.  In the MHE group, we found a significant positive correlation ( Interrelationship of BuChE activity in serum and RBC count. To investigate the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and iron accumulation, we conducted a correlation analysis between the target quadrant stay time in spatial exploration test (on the sixth day) of HC and MHE groups with susceptibility values in the frontal cortex. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between the susceptibility values and the latency period in the MHE group ( Correlation analysis was used to predict the relationship between spatial memory and susceptibility values of frontal cortex in all rats. Correlation analysis of  To evaluate the relationship between susceptibility and BuChE activity, we conducted a correlation analysis between these variables in the frontal cortex of HC and MHE groups. Our analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between susceptibility values and BuChE activity ( The correlation between the BuChE activity and susceptibility values of frontal cortex in all rats;  This study utilized QSM technology to evaluate alterations in iron content within the frontal lobe tissue of rats with MHE. Our findings revealed a significant increase in susceptibility values within the bilateral frontal lobe tissue of MHE group. Additionally, we observed a noteworthy enhancement in BuChE activity levels in the frontal cortex of MHE group, while BuChE activity within their serum significantly decreased. Further analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between susceptibility values and BuChE activity in the frontal cortex of MHE group. Furthermore, our research determined a positive correlation between BuChE activity in the peripheral blood of MHE rats and their RBC count. These results may provide insight into the underlying biological mechanisms associated with cognitive impairment in MHE and emphasize the potential role of iron overload in this disease. In this study, a murine model of MHE was established by utilizing TAA. Cognitive impairments such as deficits in memory, learning, and spatial orientation were evaluated in the MHE group through MWM testing. Due to its demonstrated accuracy in measuring memory and attention deficits (Singh and Trigun,  Iron is the most abundant metal in the human body and plays a critical role in numerous biological processes (Yang et al.,  Cholinergic neurons are primarily located in areas of the brain that are associated with cognitive function (Méndez et al.,  Our study results suggest that an imbalance in the cholinergic system related to cognitive function may represent a neuropathological characteristic of MHE, with liver failure-induced iron dyshomeostasis potentially playing a predominant role in this process. Elevated iron-dependent BuChE levels can accelerate the decay of ACh in the brain, leading to a deterioration of cognitive status in MHE patients. Previous research has demonstrated significant reductions in ACh content in specific brain regions in HE model rats (Garcia-Ayllon et al.,  In the context of liver failure, the disruption of iron homeostasis culminates in iron overload, which can trigger BuChE expression and accelerate the progression of MHE. Consequently, it is pertinent to investigate whether a combinatory therapeutic approach involving cholinesterase inhibitors and natural iron chelators like lactoferrin may represent a more efficacious treatment strategy for MHE. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between iron overload and BuChE in MHE. Our findings demonstrated that peripheral blood levels of BuChE were positively correlated with RBC count in MHE model rats. Iron overload may act as a modulator of changes in BuChE activity observed within the frontal lobe tissue of MHE model rats, while the alterations in BuChE activity detected within the frontal lobe extract may be associated with spatial orientation and behavioral changes relating to MHE. These discoveries have provided potential therapeutic targets for MHE treatment, augmenting our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MHE and providing new avenues for its clinical management.","['minimal hepatic encephalopathy', 'butyrylcholinesterase', 'quantitative susceptibility mapping', 'iron deposition', 'cognitive function']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,"""sti"""
11466375,"Risk of Clade II Mpox Associated with Intimate and Nonintimate Close Contact Among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Adults — United States, August 2022–July 2023",,"Monkeypox virus can spread through intimate or close contact with a person with mpox. Among men who have sex with men and transgender persons who reported close contact with a person with mpox, condomless receptive anal sex was associated with approximately five times the odds of mpox after controlling for mpox vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics, and concurrent close contact behaviors. The findings in this report underscore the importance of ongoing multifaceted mpox prevention activities, including mpox vaccination and education on safer sex practices, to reduce the spread of mpox. A global outbreak of clade II mpox associated with sexual contact, disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), has been ongoing since May 2022. Information on types of contact most associated with transmission is limited. This report used data from a multijurisdictional vaccine effectiveness case-control study of sexually active persons aged 18–49 years who identified as MSM or transgender, collected during August 2022–July 2023. Odds of mpox associated with selected types of intimate and nonintimate close contact with a person with mpox were estimated. Among 457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients who met minimum data requirements, 150 (32.8%) case-patients and 57 (5.5%) control patients reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Adjusted odds of mpox were 5.4 times as high among those who reported having condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox, compared with participants who reported close contact with a person with mpox and no condomless receptive anal sex with that person (OR = 5.4; p = 0.031). Although the mpox vaccine is highly effective, vaccination coverage remains low; a multifaceted approach to prevention remains important and should include vaccination promotion, safer sex practices, and increasing awareness that mpox continues to circulate. In May 2022, an unprecedented worldwide outbreak of clade II mpox, caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), was detected among persons in countries with no history of sustained community transmission. In the United States and worldwide, the ongoing outbreak has been associated with sexual contact, and has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) ( A secondary analysis was conducted using data previously collected for a vaccine effectiveness (VE) case-control study using patient self-reported survey data and jurisdiction-reported data from 12 U.S. jurisdictions ( Case- and control patients were eligible to participate if they were sexually active, The analytic sample was restricted to case- and control patients from the VE study who reported close contact with a person with mpox. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted odds of select types of intimate and nonintimate contact and case- or control patient status. The unadjusted models examined demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender identity), a composite variable of HIV status and HIV PrEP or treatment (i.e., antiretroviral [ARV]) use and adherence, presence of immunocompromising conditions or medications, Among the 1,487 eligible survey respondents from the VE study (457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients), 207 (13.9%; 150 case-patients and 57 control patients) reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Compared with control patients, case-patients were slightly older (aged 35.5 years versus 33 years) and had fewer recent sexual partners (two versus three) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** P-values comparing the percentage of case-patients to control patients by sociodemographic and health categories were calculated using Pearson’s chi-square test. P-values for continuous variables were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. *** HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. **** Symptoms consistent with mpox included rash or skin lesions, fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. In the unadjusted models, behaviors associated with increased odds of mpox among persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox included condomless receptive anal sex (OR = 3.2; p = 0.006), condomless insertive anal sex (OR = 2.8; p = 0.009), receiving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.7; p = 0.006), giving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.0; p = 0.046), and sharing towels, bedding, or clothing (OR = 2.3; p = 0.034) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** HIV PrEP use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who did not report living with HIV. HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. Numerous studies have identified sexual contact as the primary risk factor for mpox; however, few have examined risk associated with specific intimate and nonintimate close contact behaviors. In this study, data from a previously conducted case-control study were analyzed to estimate the odds of mpox associated with selected intimate and nonintimate behaviors among MSM and transgender persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox. Condomless sex, including anal sex and oral sex, was associated with increased odds of mpox, as was sharing towels, bedding, and clothing. After adjusting for measured confounders, including mpox vaccination and concurrent close contact behaviors, condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox remained associated with increased odds of mpox. Although condoms might reduce MPXV exposure at anogenital or oral mucosal sites, condoms alone might not prevent all exposures to MPXV because rash can occur on other parts of the body and transmission can occur through other routes, including saliva and respiratory secretions ( As clade II mpox continues to circulate in the United States, mpox mitigation activities remain critical ( Studies from areas with endemic mpox and during the ongoing 2022 global outbreak have identified contaminated household items such as linens and utensils as potential, albeit less common, MPXV transmission routes ( The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, selection bias is likely because survey participation was voluntary and recruitment for control patients occurred in sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinics. Differences in sexual risk-taking behaviors might exist between those who participated in the survey and those who did not and between persons who did and did not seek health care. Second, survey data were self-reported and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias, particularly because of the sensitive nature of some of the questions regarding sexual behaviors, and because the time between index event and survey completion varied. Third, intimate contact and sexual behavior variables were limited to a few broad measures in this study and do not account for potentially important factors such as frequency and duration of contact, partner type, group sex, substance use, or impact of sexual networks, all of which might affect risk for mpox transmission. Fourth, <15% of survey participants reported close contact with a person with mpox; because of this small sample size, the analysis might be underpowered to detect associations with behaviors that were less commonly reported. Finally, although the 12 U.S. jurisdictions included in this study covered a broad geographic area, data might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. The mpox vaccine is highly effective, and clinicians should continue to promote vaccination among eligible persons.",[],2024-10-10,Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,"""sti"""
11465850,"Exploring cultural competence barriers in the primary care sexual and reproductive health centres in Catalonia, Spain: perspectives from immigrant women and healthcare providers","Immigrant populations, especially women, continue facing challenges in accessing quality healthcare, particularly sexual and reproductive health services (SRH). Poor cultural competent health systems contribute to communication challenges between immigrant women and healthcare providers perpetuating health disparities. This exploratory study describes these communication barriers from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers within the Catalan health system and its implications to ensure an equitable provision of SRH services. An exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in various municipalities of Barcelona with high concentration of immigrants. Eight focus groups ( Language barriers and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of quality healthcare provision hindered the ability of immigrant women and providers to interact effectively. Limited availability of intercultural mediators and inadequate cultural competence training opportunities for health staff were also identified. Findings suggest a lack of minority representation in the Catalan health workforce and leadership roles. This study reinforces the evidence of persistent inequities in accessing healthcare among immigrant populations by focusing on the cultural competence barriers of the Catalan health system in the provision and access to SRH services. The regularization of adequately trained intercultural mediators, quality training in cultural competence for health staff and a commitment to increase workforce diversity would contribute to improve intercultural communication between immigrant patients and providers. An urgent call to action in this direction is needed to ensure an equitable access to SRH services among immigrant women. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12939-024-02290-5.","Despite efforts made over the last two decades, evidence of disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants in accessing healthcare services persist across Europe [ Intercultural communication in healthcare is the interaction between healthcare professionals and patients of different cultural groups (international, interfaith, interethnic, interracial) to reach an understanding, build a shared reality and establish a satisfactory relationship [ The concept of cultural competence goes beyond healthcare providers’ intercultural communication skills and also involves the ability of organizations to effectively deliver healthcare services that meet the social, cultural and linguistic needs of patients [ In Spain, significant immigration flows began at the turn of the millennium when the non-native population doubled in just one decade, a growing tendency which has continued until now [ Up to date, a very few studies have addressed cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Spanish and Catalan contexts [ An exploratory-descriptive qualitative research design [ Immigrant women and healthcare providers were selected using maximum variability sampling: convenience, purposive and snowball sampling techniques were combined based on age, length of stay in Spain, educational background or healthcare role. Inclusion criteria for immigrant women were determined by their country of origin (Morocco and Pakistan), age at migration (16 years or older, thus not exposed to the public Spanish education system) and their eligibility to the cervical cancer screening program in Catalonia (aged 25 or turning 25 in the year of the study, up to 65 and having a cervix). The main inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were that they needed to be working actively in the primary care SRH centres and interacting directly with these two groups of immigrants. No exclusion criteria were established for healthcare professionals, but we ensured that providers reported at least ten consultations per week with immigrant patients from Morocco and/or Pakistan. Half of healthcare professionals reported that at least 50% of their patients were immigrants. The final sample size was determined when data saturation was achieved, indicating that additional interviews no longer provided new insights into the key dimension of the study. We recruited Moroccan and Pakistani participants in neighbourhoods of Barcelona city, Sant Adrià del Besòs, Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat. These were chosen because they represent different health districts, have a high proportion of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrants and include urban and semi-urban residential areas. We recruited a wide range of healthcare professionals, such as community health workers, nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, all of whom worked in primary care SRH centres located in the same areas where most women participants were recruited. An intercultural mediator was also included, as these professionals greatly contribute in the provision of care for immigrants. Study fieldwork was performed between July and December 2022. A total of 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) (4 [all in Darija] with 24 participants from Morocco and 4 [all in Urdu] with 27 participants from Pakistan), 22 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) (12 [7 in Darija and 5 in Spanish] with Moroccan and 10 [5 in Urdu, 1 in Punjabi and 4 in Spanish] with Pakistani women) and 13 key informant interviews (KIIs) [all in Spanish] with healthcare providers were conducted. Topic guides for FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women were designed based on a literature review on barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening among immigrant populations conducted for a broader study mentioned above. Questions covered individual (i.e. lack of language skills), interpersonal (i.e. social influences and cultural norms) and health system (i.e. interpreting and translation services) level factors. FGDs were moderated by a nurse (HOE) and a community health worker (SMH) with the same cultural and linguistic background as participants, and the first author (JGL) and two research assistants (RAs) (KM and AS), second-generation immigrant university students, conducted the SSIs. FGDs were conducted in community and religious centres (e.g. mosques) and the interviews were conducted in places chosen by the participants (e.g. women’s and interviewers’ home, religious centres). Further details of the data collection process have been reported elsewhere [ Interviews with healthcare providers explored their views and experiences providing SRH services, and specifically cervical cancer screening, to immigrant women. The overall goal was to understand how these women access healthcare, their preventive health practices, and their engagement with SRH services from the perspective of those who directly work with immigrant populations. These KIIs with healthcare providers also aimed to identify potential cultural and religious barriers and discuss strategies to increase participation in cervical cancer screening programmes, including the potential acceptance of HPV self-sampling. The first author (JGL) carried out all the interviews with healthcare professionals. These took place in the providers’ workplace, except three interviews which were conducted either at the interviewee’s home ( The RAs (KM and AS) transcribed women’s audio recordings from Darija and Urdu directly into Spanish and English, respectively, with minor editing to improve readability. The first author (JGL) and a co-author (VRS, physician and public health student) transcribed healthcare providers’ audio recordings into Spanish. We conducted a social constructionist thematic analysis [ After coding and analysing the two datasets from immigrant women and healthcare providers separately, a data triangulation process was performed following a ‘complementary’ approach: searching to describe a problem (e.g. cultural competence barriers to access SRH services) from different perspectives [ 
 Summary of cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Catalan health system using Betancourt et al.’ (2003) framework • Lack of language skills • Perceived discriminatory attitudes • Time pressure in the provision of care • Cultural taboos (e.g. offering certain SRH services) • Limited patient informed consent and confidentiality • Limited availability of intercultural mediators • Limited and underused translation services and materials • Lack of adequate cultural competence training for health staff • Low minority representation in the healthcare workforce (e.g. nurses) • Low minority representation in leadership roles The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (26186), Bellvitge University Hospital (PR 140/22) and Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (PR(AG)317/2022). Each participant was provided with comprehensive information about the study and gave written informed consent prior to data collection. Immigrant women were compensated with a public transportation 10-trip pass to ensure that participation did not impose a financial burden on them (transport to FGDs’ and SSIs’ locations) and to acknowledge their contribution to the research. Healthcare professionals did not receive any compensation. The Moroccan and Pakistani participants’ ages ranged from 24 to 65 years. The majority (82.2%) were married and nearly all Pakistani women (97.3%) had children, compared with 77.8% of Moroccan women. The primary reason for migration was family reunification. Despite most women (80.0%) of both groups having lived in Catalonia for over 5 years, up to 63% of them (52.8% Moroccan and 73% Pakistani) reported needing a translator during medical visits. A similar percentage was found among women who had arrived in the country (less than 5 years ago). Moroccan women were more likely to speak Spanish or Catalan at home than Pakistani women (33% vs. 5%). A total of 72.6% of participants reported having been screened for cervical cancer at least once in their lifetime. Women’s detailed socio-demographic information can be found in Table  Healthcare providers’ ages ranged from 29 to 59 years. All of them were female, except for a gynaecologist and a community health worker. Furthermore, eight healthcare professionals were Spanish (mainly from Catalonia) and bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) and, five were originally from either Morocco or Pakistan and one of them also bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) (Table

 Characteristics of healthcare providers interviewed Qualitative findings from the FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women, as well as from the interviews with healthcare professionals are presented below and organised by each of the cultural competence barriers identified in the framework proposed by Betancour et al. (2003) [ We identified the inability to understand and speak either of the two official languages in Catalonia (Spanish/Catalan) as a barrier among Moroccan and Pakistani women regardless of their length of stay in the country. According to healthcare providers’ perceptions, language barriers appeared more prevalent among Pakistani than Moroccan women. Women from both countries often depended on the availability of their husbands, family members and friends to arrange appointments or to receive information. For instance, when their male partners could not accompany them, some women preferred to skip or postpone medical appointments until someone else was available. Whereas Pakistani women tended to visit the doctor with their husbands, Moroccan participants counted also on friends and even on other compatriots they met while waiting in the primary care centre for appointments. Whilst the support of the husband and other family members and friends seemed to attenuate the language barriers of women, this did not guarantee that they received accurate information about SRH services. Healthcare providers reported inadequate and incomplete translations by male partners and family members: 
 Immigrant women and healthcare providers mentioned having personal strategies to overcome language barriers. Some women managed to communicate with providers using body language, through mobile phone conversations with family members or through paper notes, as this provider explained: Body language, visual materials (e.g. pictograms), physical objects (e.g. plastic uterus), translated forms and Google Translator were resources used by midwives and gynaecologists to overcome language barriers: They also emphasized the importance of expressing empathy and building rapport with immigrant patients through eye contact and using some words in their local languages to improve communication, as this female midwife explained:  While immigrant women considered the Catalan health service to be good overall, even better than in their own countries, and healthcare providers to be “caring”, some women felt they did not receive the care they expected. Several participants reported a lack of empathy and unhelpful attitudes from the health staff, especially clinic receptionists, but also some healthcare providers. Women from both Moroccan and Pakistani origin reported feelings that health staff were racist and held discriminatory attitudes against them when they could not communicate properly in Catalan or Spanish, for instance, to book a medical appointment. This deterred some women from seeking healthcare services in Catalonia and instead, seeking care in their own countries: Immigrant women also reported negative and discriminatory attitudes from healthcare providers, especially clinic receptionists, when they requested or expressed their preference for a female professional to undertake gynaecology examinations, deterring them from requesting a same sex provider in the Catalan health system: We observed that lack of culturally sensitive policies or clear guidelines to address cultural conflicts led to some confusion concerning the right of immigrant women to request a healthcare professional of the same sex. Most providers interviewed understood Moroccan and Pakistani women´s preferences for female doctors and stated that they should have the right to request it. However, two gynaecologists raised concerns that choosing the sex of the health professional would contradict the gender equity and non-discrimination policies of the Catalan health system: Even when immigrant women possessed basic or everyday language capacity, some felt they were not being listened to properly as health providers did not give them sufficient time to explain themselves: Healthcare providers confirmed this impression, explaining they have limited time allocated for each patient. Time pressure was even stronger when seeing immigrant patients with language difficulties, low literacy and lack of knowledge of the Catalan health system. This led providers to feel more overloaded and to express feelings of frustration and exhaustion: 
 
 We identified cultural differences between women and healthcare providers’ beliefs and perceptions regarding the use of certain SRH services and the context in which they would discuss them. Addressing women’s health issues, such as menstruation, in front of male relatives (e.g. husbands, sons) and offering specific SRH services, such as contraception and pregnancy termination services, could be considered offensive or against women’s cultural and religious practices, while for healthcare providers these were common issues addressed with their patients. Cultural differences were also identified regarding certain health examinations, such as cervical cancer screening, at specific times, for example, during Ramadan. A midwife also referred to the difficulties that husbands sometimes found when explaining certain women’s issues: Healthcare professionals also mentioned difficulties in addressing topics related to sexual health and genitalia. In this, they distinguished between first-generation and second-generation immigrants, perceiving the latter to be more aware of their bodies and willing to ask questions about sexual health, whereas the former were more ‘detached’ from their own bodies and had lower literacy about their own anatomy. This led some healthcare providers to provide basic information about certain tests: While immigrant women considered their husbands and other relatives as the most important social support in the host country, the health professionals sometimes found them more of an obstacle during health consultation. For instance, some professionals expressed concern about whether immigrant women made informed decisions about their SRH:  Despite this informed consent issue, a midwife emphasized the importance of establishing a good relationship with husbands due to their role as decision-makers. However, she pointed that culturally this is a challenging goal: Similarly, healthcare professionals felt that the presence of a family member reduces confidentiality and provider-patient privacy, something that is a foundation of how healthcare professionals understand quality care. For instance, the presence of relatives prevented providers from screening Moroccan and Pakistani women for highly sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or sexually transmitted infections (STIs):  Healthcare providers also reported challenges in ensuring confidentiality when they need to communicate a test result or give an appointment by phone to a woman with language difficulties, and a midwife expressed other ethical challenges they face when immigrant women go to the health centre accompanied by their underaged children to help them with translation. In these circumstances, she explained that professionals skip some explanations regarding the genitals and vaginal examination and give the patient only basic information. Gynaecologists and midwives narrated their strategies to ensure users’ privacy and confidentiality, but all of them agreed that the availability of intercultural mediators would be the most effective support to ensure confidentiality and health informed decisions: We found disparities in the provision of intercultural mediators across the Catalan health system. Whilst the primary care centres in those neighbourhoods of Barcelona city with the highest concentration of immigrants, such as Raval and Besòs, offered intercultural mediator services in various languages (e.g. Arabic, Urdu, Chinese), in other municipalities with similar volume of immigrants, such as Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, these services were very limited or even non-existent: Since mediator services were scarce, informal interpreter services were voluntarily provided by health staff of Moroccan and Pakistani origin, as this gynaecologist explained:  We also found that the intercultural mediators working currently in Barcelona are not integrated into the health system. Most of these professionals received training in intercultural mediation in the past and currently they are hired by outsourced companies and work in challenging conditions, as some providers confirmed and a mediator explained:  Despite the scarcity of intercultural mediators and lack of integration of these professionals within the health system, interviewed healthcare providers agreed that intercultural mediators play an important role in ensuring effective communication and provision of quality care to immigrant patients who lack language skills, especially in the paediatric and primary care SRH centres. They advocated for the regulation of the cost of these services in the Catalan health system and emphasized the importance of equipping these professionals with adequate intercultural mediation training to minimise potential conflicts, as healthcare providers pointed out that these professionals are not mere interpreters, but health mediators with specific training in cultural skills: One healthcare professional added that even when the mediation services are needed and available, these must be offered as an option, referring to the reluctance expressed by some immigrant women to use these services due to a lack of trust. In this sense, a midwife concluded that greater efforts must be made to explain the role of the intercultural mediators and facilitate trustee relationships between these and immigrant patients. Finally, a midwife highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the gender of the mediators, at least in the primary care SRH centres:  In addition to this insufficient number of intercultural mediators, we found an underutilisation of the available telephone translation service (061 Salut Respon) by providers. They expressed mixed opinions about this service’s effectiveness. Some considered it a good alternative if mediators were not available, but most admitted to not using this service because it was too slow for the limited time assigned per patient and suboptimal to address language and cultural problems. A few healthcare professionals were even unaware of its existence. The availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate information and education materials seemed also scarce. Healthcare professionals noted that the webpage from the Department of Health (Canal Salut), is translated into English and French in addition to the official languages in Catalonia. They explained that they usually used information and education materials (e.g. questionnaires, forms, health prevention flyers) translated into different languages, although some providers mentioned a lack of translations in Urdu, for instance. The majority of the healthcare professionals interviewed had attended cultural competence training courses at some point in their careers. They found the courses helpful but inadequate, as they were often short, general and lacked interactive activities. Some providers strongly believed that formal and compulsory training on cultural competence should be integrated into the healthcare professionals’ curriculum. Currently, cultural competence training sessions are usually provided by community-based and non-governmental organisations, and lack institutionally funding, relying on the availability of private funds. Some healthcare professionals also proposed training administrative staff, particularly receptionists, on migrants’ rights because  Healthcare providers mentioned that an ideal solution to overcome cultural competence issues would be to have a more diverse health workforce, in this case, more Moroccan and Pakistani nurses, midwives and gynaecologists:  Immigrant women also welcomed the availability of more healthcare staff from their own countries and they thought this would improve communication between immigrant patients and providers. A few Moroccan participants observed an increasing number of pharmacists, nurses, auxiliary nurses and doctors with Arabic language skills:  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing cultural competence barriers in the context of the primary care SRH centres in Catalonia, Spain, from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers. First, at clinical level, the results indicate that lack of command of the local languages (Spanish and Catalan) and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of the provision of quality care hindered the ability of immigrant women and care providers to interact effectively. Second, at structural level, we identified limited availability of intercultural mediator services and translation materials, and inadequate cultural competence trainings available for healthcare staff. Finally, at organisational level, results suggest low minority representation in the health workforce and leadership roles of the Catalan health system. Lack of knowledge of the host country’s official languages is one of the dominant barriers to obtain accurate health information, and access and use of quality healthcare services [ The contested issue about the sex of the healthcare provider, especially providing SRH services, has been extensively addressed in the literature [ Time pressure was also a relevant factor hindering communication between immigrant patients and healthcare providers. On the one hand, immigrant women reported not being given sufficient time to explain their health problems and, on the other hand, healthcare providers reported that low language skills often meant immigrant patients required longer consultation times and greater efforts to communicate with them. This, along with time constraints due to heavy patient loads, led providers to feeling frustrated and overworked, which was attributed by one gynaecologist to immigrants’ inappropriate use of healthcare services. This perception concerning immigrants’ use of the public healthcare services was also found in previous studies conducted in Catalonia with healthcare providers [ The above findings demonstrate how the intersection of language barriers and lack of sufficient resources (e.g. personnel) hinder the communication between immigrant patients and healthcare professionals. Despite these challenges, we found that both immigrant women and healthcare professionals made efforts to understand each other. Non-verbal communication, such as body language and pictograms, and the use of Google Translator were some personal strategies reported in this and previous studies conducted with migrants in Europe [ Consistent with previous research conducted with immigrant populations in Australia and the US [ Limitations to ensure confidentiality and obtained informed consent from immigrant women were other concerns raised by healthcare providers, who agreed that a fair deployment of intercultural mediators would help to address the above linguistic and cultural differences. However, we identified significant disparities in the deployment of intercultural mediators across the Barcelona province, with services predominantly available in primary care centres located in specific neighbourhoods within Barcelona city. This limited availability of mediator services aligns with findings from a recent systematic review assessing barriers and facilitators to access interpreter services in European health systems [ As in other studies performed in Pakistan and Finland [ Finally, field observation and key informant consultations suggested that the representation of minorities in the Catalan healthcare workforce is still low. Studies in the US have shown that diversity and inclusion can help organisations improve both patient care quality and financial results [ Based on our research evidence, the above cultural competence barriers at clinical, structural and organisational levels should be addressed in parallel with other health system deficiencies, such as saturation, excess of demand, insufficient time per patient [ This study has several methodological strengths and limitations. It is noteworthy to mention that the researchers’ social position (e.g. gender, age, race, immigration status) and personal characteristics and experiences affect the research process [ Regarding the study limitations, it is important to mention that the inclusion of only two national groups limits the generalizability of the findings to other immigrant experiences and cultural backgrounds, although it serves as a valuable case study. Additionally, the small sample size of healthcare professionals, who primarily work in areas with high concentration of immigrant populations, may not capture the perspectives from those working in areas where immigrants are less represented. This study emphasizes significant cultural competence barriers within the Catalan health system that hinder immigrant patient-provider relationship, potentially increasing disparities in accessing SRH services in Catalonia, Spain. Addressing these barriers requires a fair deployment of intercultural mediators, clear guidelines to help manage cultural challenges, the formalization of cultural competence training for healthcare professionals, and a commitment to increase workforce diversity. These steps are crucial to mitigating the impact of language barriers and cultural differences on communication between immigrant patients and providers, thereby improving access to quality care. Health systems across Europe, including the Catalan health system, are urged to take a proactive role and implement on-the-ground actions aiming to improve cultural competence and ensure an equitable provision of quality care for immigrant populations.

11465159,Naa80 is required for actin N-terminal acetylation and normal hearing in zebrafish,"A zebrafish knockout model of the N-terminal acetyltransferase Naa80 demonstrates that this enzyme is required for actin N-terminal acetylation and normal inner ear development. Actin is a critical component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. In animals, actins undergo unique N-terminal processing by dedicated enzymes resulting in mature acidic and acetylated forms. The final step, N-terminal acetylation, is catalyzed by NAA80 in humans. N-terminal acetylation of actin is crucial for maintaining normal cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility in human cell lines. However, the physiological impact of actin N-terminal acetylation remains to be fully understood.

 All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animal Management Rules of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China and were reviewed by Animal Ethical and Welfare of Tianjin University (TJUE-2023-141). HT22 cells were obtained from the Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and used for all  HT22 cells (1 × 10 Bare electrodes and MoS Adult male Wistar rats (250–280 g) were housed under standard conditions, with  The MoS The preparation of the MoS UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by using a Shimadzu 3600 double-beam spectrophotometer with QS-grade quartz cuvettes at room temperature. XPS spectra analysis was carried out on the ESCALAB 250 Xi system (Thermo Scientific) with an Al Kα X-ray source operating at 300 W, and the original data were peak-fitted in XPSPEAK41 software. The surface morphologies of MoS In order to study the effect of surface roughness on electrode performance, Ag electrode was modified with different deposition potentials of MoS All electrochemical measurements were carried out in PBS electrolyte at pH 7.4 at room temperature, completed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The three-electrode configuration was used, with the MoS For EIS, the test frequency range was set to 1 - 10 The CV was performed by scanning for two cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s over a potential range of −0.8 V–0.1 V. The CSCc was calculated by integrating the current overtime in the potential range of −0.8 to 0.1 V in the second cycle. Bending stability was assessed by bending 5 mm electrodes by 30°, 90°, and 180° using custom molds, respectively, and then testing the electrochemical impedance of the bent electrodes with a three-electrode system. Bending stiffness was characterized using a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (Q800, TA Instruments) in double cantilever mode. Electrodes with a length of 6 cm were mounted on a cantilever clamp, and then were tested with frequency sweeps (0.01–10 Hz) under controlled displacement (100 μm) conditions.

The signal was recorded digitally at a sampling rate of 30 kHz for at least 30 min per acute recording. The acquired LFP signals were intercepted in a 20 s window and band-pass filtered from 1 to 50 Hz, and then the power spectrum was plotted by FFT. Multi-band band-pass filtering was applied to the LFP signal to categorize it into five bands: δ (1–4 Hz), θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–14 Hz), β (14–30 Hz) and γ (30–50 Hz), and the time domain plots of different frequency bands were plotted and their energies are calculated. The phase synchronization of the LFP signals acquired from the bare and MoS x is the cross spectrum of the two signals, ∂(x) is the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum, E(.) is the expected value operator. The WPLI results range between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate higher phase synchronization and stronger coupling. Random signal matching experiment is performed by labeling each segment of electrophysiological signals with a serial number and then using a randomized algorithm to generate matching sequences and calculate the WPLI. All the analyses performed on the LFP signals were implemented using MATLAB code. One week after electrode implantation, the rats were anesthetized and perfused with PBS followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA), and their fresh brains were collected. The brains were fixed in 30 mL of PFA for 24 h, then dehydrated in a gradient using 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solutions, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compounds (Tissue-Tek, USA). The brains were then cut into 20 μm sections and mounted on glass slides (stored at −80°C). For staining, the brain sections were brought to room temperature, washed with PBS, then treated for 30 min with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in 1x PBS) and 10% donkey serum. Excess liquid was removed, and primary antibodies including GFAP (Abcam, ab4648, 1:10), Iba1 (Thermo, MA5-27726, 1:100), and NeuN (CST, 94403S, 1:100) were applied and incubated overnight at 4°C. The sections were washed with PBS to remove excess primary antibody solution, and then secondary antibodies were added in a light-protected environment, including CoraLite488-conjugated Affinipure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Proteintech, SA00013-6, 1:100), and Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 594) (Abcam, ab150108, 1:100). After incubating for 100 min, the excess secondary antibodies were washed off with PBS. Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the sections were imaged using a confocal microscope. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence graphs was performed using ImageJ, which was implemented by a program script that calculates the fluorescence intensity of the biomarker inside the circle with a radius step of 25 μm from the center of the circle as the center of the electrode implantation position and normalizes it.

We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 9,407 adolescents aged 12–18 years in China from September 2022 to March 2023. We employed Young’s 20-item Internet Addiction Test (IAT-20), the Social Connectedness Scale-Revised (SCS-R), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CER), and the DSM-5 Level-2 Depression Scale to assess mental health outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was also performed to examine the independent association between the measured variables and depression. Mediation analysis was then conducted to evaluate the mediating roles of social connectedness and cognitive emotion regulation in the relationship between PIU and depression. We found that the prevalence of PIU was 21.8%. Offline SC (indirect effect: 0.112, 95% CI: 0.104–0.121) and negative CER (indirect effect: 00.140, 95% CI: 0.129–0.152) mainly played a parallel mediating role in the relationship between PIU and depression, along with online SC (on_SC) (indirect effect: 0.007, 95% CI: 0.005–0.010). These findings provide valuable insights into how PIU is associated with depression and highlight the importance of fostering real-life interpersonal interactions. However, the generalizability of this study’s findings to other populations may be limited due to cultural factors.","Problematic Internet use (PIU), commonly identified as a new form of addictive behavior ( Individuals with PIU are more likely to develop depression ( For instance, a study conducted in China involving 17,058 middle school students found that adolescents with Internet addiction were more likely to experience depression, with anxiety partially mediating this relationship ( Higher levels of SC have been associated with the use of positive coping strategies when facing challenges ( Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) determines the coping strategies an individual uses to manage the intensity and nature of emotional experience ( Several mediating factors in the association between PIU and depression have been identified, such as fear of missing out, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and bodily pain ( Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of PIU among adolescents aged 12–18 years in China and to assess its impact on depression. The secondary objective was to examine the potential mediating effects of SC and CER, as well as to explore their interaction within the relationship between PIU and depression. Additionally, we aimed to investigate any differences between online and offline SC as mediators. This cross-sectional study was conducted across four Chinese provinces—Fujian, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Xinjiang—representing the eastern, southern, western, and northern regions of China, respectively, from September 2022 to March 2023. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (NO. 2019-907). In each province, one to two middle schools were selected for participation in the study ( Flowchart of the procedure for data collection. A total of 11,946 adolescents were included in this survey, which was administered online using non-skippable questions to ensure no missing responses. Based on the following criteria, 2,539 questionnaires were excluded: (1) participants reporting an age younger than 12 or older than 18; (2) participants who completed the survey in less than 10 min; (3) participants who indicated that their responses were “false” or “entirely false” when asked, “To what extent does your survey reflect the real situation?” (entirely false, false, general, true, entirely true) at the end of the survey; (4) and questionnaires missing key demographic information. Additionally, questionnaires with matching attributes—such as name, age, sex, height, weight, and school affiliation—were considered duplicates, and only the most complete data set was retained for further analysis. Ultimately, data from 9,407 participants (14.90 ± 1.61 years) were included in this study, representing 78.7% of the total sample. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic variables, including age, sex, only-child status, handedness, place of residence, father’s education level, and mother’s education level. The IAT-20, developed by Oliveira et al. ( The Social Connectedness Scale Revised (SCS-R), developed by Lee and Robbins ( The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) was used to evaluate CER strategies applied in response to stressful events ( The DSM-5-TR Level 2—Depression—Child Age 11–17 measure is a 14-item patient-reported outcome measurement tool from the PROMIS Depression Short Form, developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), designed to assess depression in children and adolescents ( Categorical variables were described using numbers (percentages), while continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviations). Social connectedness (SC) measurements included on_SC, off_SC, and SC_gap (calculated as the difference between the on_SC and off_SC scores). Based on whether the SC_gap score was positive or negative, participants were categorized into the “more online” and “more offline” groups, respectively. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify whether PIU, social connectedness, pCER and nCER were associated with depression among adolescents. Then, the multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify whether PIU, social connectedness, pCER and nCER were independently associated with depression among adolescents. Spearman’s correlation was conducted to examine mutual correlations between sociodemographic variables, PIU, SC measures, CER, and depression. Variables that were significantly associated with depression in the multivariate logistic regression were subsequently included in the structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the mediating effects of SC and CER in the relationship between PIU and depression. The effect size in the mediation analysis was assessed using the STDYX standardized effect size. The fit of the hypothesis models was evaluated using the chi-squared degrees of freedom ratio (χ A total of 2,000 bootstraps were conducted, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the estimates were calculated. Sociodemographic variables that were independently associated with depression in multivariate regression were adjusted for in all SEM models. Group differences, regression, and correlation analysis were conducted using SPSS 26.0, while SEM analysis was conducted using Mplus 8.0 ( The prevalence of depression (mild to severe) and PIU were 35.8 and 21.8%, respectively.

Adjusted ORs (95% CI) based on multivariable logistic regression using depression-or-not as a dependent variable, sociodemographic factors, SC_gap, pCER, nCER, and PIU. According to univariate logistic regression, on_SC, off_SC, SC_gap, nCER, pCER, and PIU showed significant associations with depression ( After adjusting for confounding factors (sex, handedness, and residence), SC_gap, nCER, and PIU had independently and significantly positive associations with depression ( The results of Spearman’s correlation analysis are shown in  Spearman’s correlation among sociodemographic variables, PIU, depression, nCER, and SCs. on_SC, online social connectedness; off_SC, offline social connectedness; SC_gap, online-offline social connectedness gap; nCER, negative cognitive emotion regulation; PIU, problematic Internet use, the total score of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT-20). Mediation analysis showed that three chain mediation models were all verified as satisfactory goodness of fit. PIU was directly associated with depression in Models A, B, and C ( In Model A, both on_SC and nCER significantly mediated the relationship between PIU and depression ( The mediation effects of SC ( In Model B, off_SC and nCER were identified as mediators ( In Model C, the single mediating effect of nCER accounted for 37.0% of the total effect ( This study, based on a national sample of 9,407 adolescents in China, yielded novel findings indicating that off_SC, SC_gap, and nCER mainly played parallel mediating roles in the relationship between PIU and depression. Although on_SC also had a significant mediating effect, its role was less prominent compared to off_SC. These findings provide a new perspective on how PIU contributes to depression, highlighting the critical importance of fostering real-life interpersonal interactions to mitigate its negative impact on adolescents. According to this study, the prevalence of PIU among adolescents was 21.8% (95% CI: 20.9–22.6%). This is consistent with a recent survey involving 3,357 Chinese adolescents, which reported a PIU rate of 26.09% ( These discrepancies may partly result from variations in the sampling methods and instruments used. The previous study employed the same questionnaire and PIU cut-off score as ours. However, their sample size was relatively small. In contrast, the latter study employed a parental assessment questionnaire ( A study conducted in Spain showed a higher PIU rate of 33% among adolescents ( To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm the mediating roles of both on_SC and off_SC and their gap in the relationship between PIU and depression. Our findings suggest that adolescents with PIU experienced a significant decline in off_SC, which is consistent with previous research indicating that individuals with PIU make minimal effort to maintain interpersonal relationships ( Additionally, online social connections served as a buffer against depression and anxiety among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic ( This novel finding indicates that PIU leads adolescents to prioritize online interactions over offline communication, thereby increasing the risk of depression. In line with our findings, previous studies have highlighted that face-to-face communication fosters high-quality listening, behavioral synchrony, and self-disclosure, which serve as protective factors against negative emotions ( In addition, our study also demonstrated the mediating role of nCER in the relationship between PIU and depression. Previous research has linked nCER to PIU, including Internet gaming disorder ( Furthermore, those who rely on maladaptive strategies may be more susceptible to psychopathology ( The present study also identified a weak chain mediating effect from SCs to nCER. A study involving 1,291 adolescents in Ireland found that adolescents with PIU experienced less perceived social support and greater difficulty in emotion regulation ( Our SEM analysis supports these findings, demonstrating that off_SC is more effective than on_SC in reducing negative coping strategies, such as catastrophizing. Therefore, interventions aimed at enhancing off_SC should be developed for middle school students, especially those with PIU. For instance, engaging in dual sports activities has shown significant potential in reducing Internet addiction among adolescents ( There are also some limitations to this study. First, the cross-sectional design makes it difficult to establish causality, and future research could benefit from longitudinal studies. Furthermore, adolescents with PIU may use the Internet as a platform for developing other addictions, such as gaming, online shopping, or watching short videos. Moreover, due to research resource constraints, we utilized non-random sampling methods in this study, which may introduce biases associated with specific school-related factors. For instance, the educational quality and management approaches of these schools could influence students’ Internet usage and mental health. Disparities in the allocation of educational resources across provinces may also affect the generalizability of our findings. This study primarily focused on overall problematic Internet usage. Therefore, future studies should consider examining various forms of PIU (e.g., Internet gaming disorder and social media disorder) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of adolescent Internet-related behavioral issues on mental health. Despite these limitations, our study is the first to investigate the potential mediating role of SC and CER strategies. We uncovered an important mechanism that helps explain why adolescents with PIU are more likely to develop depressive symptoms. Targeted interventions and strategies in clinical practice, focusing on enhancing adolescents off_SC and promoting the adoption of positive coping strategies in response to stressors, could help improve the overall mental wellbeing of adolescents.","['problematic Internet use', 'depression', 'adolescents', 'social connectedness', 'cognitive emotion regulation', 'mediation model']",2024-9-26,Frontiers in Public Health,"""sti"""
11464204,Understanding the influence of the microbiome on childhood infections,"The microbiome is known to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.","The human microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes – including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea – that have co-evolved with our species for millennia. The number of microbes colonizing our bodies is truly staggering; for instance, infants have an estimated 1.9 trillion human cells but are colonized by more than twice that number of microbial cells, including approximately 4.4 trillion bacterial cells [ At no point across the lifespan is the microbiome as dynamic as during childhood. At birth, infants are colonized by trillions of pioneering microbes from the maternal vaginal, gut, and skin microbiota. Over the ensuing days and months, these microbial communities undergo substantial shifts in composition due to changes in the local microenvironment, environmental exposures, and microbial competition. For instance, shortly after birth, the gut is an aerobic environment typically containing high abundances of facultative anaerobes, including bacteria from the genera  Although recent studies suggest that host genetics influences the microbiota during childhood [ The comparatively few pediatric microbiome studies that have been conducted after infancy suggest that the microbiota continues to develop and mature in response to environmental exposures. In particular, increasing age has consistently been associated with changes in microbiota composition during toddlerhood. During the second and third years of life, the gut microbiota increases in diversity (number of species), and a gradual loss of  Other environmental factors have been associated with alterations to the microbiota during childhood. Among 33 Japanese children, those who attended daycare were less likely to have nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles dominated by the health-associated species  The human microbiota provides protection against infection by preventing colonization and invasion by exogenous pathogens. This important function of the microbiota, referred to as colonization resistance, occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including competition for nutritional sources, production of antimicrobial compounds, alterations of the local microenvironment, and modulation of host immune responses ( Early-life colonization of mucosal surfaces by microbes is critical to immune system development [ The human microbiota continues to modulate immune system function throughout the lifespan. In health, microbiome-host homeostasis is characterized by low levels of inflammation and immune cell recruitment sufficient to create a state that is primed to respond to potential pathogens [ The microbiota influences the development of host immune responses to pathogens through several mechanisms. Commensal microbes can induce host epithelial cells to secrete antimicrobial peptides that target specific pathogens, as well as other commensal species [ With advances in our knowledge of the factors that disrupt microbiome composition during childhood and the role that the microbiota plays in immune development, there has been substantial interest in identifying microbiome characteristics that are associated with infection susceptibility or severity ( Globally, acute respiratory infections cause more than 740,000 child deaths each year [ There are accumulating data that early-life infections alter microbiome composition or function, contributing to differences in colonization resistance and infection susceptibility later in childhood. In a longitudinal study of 114 healthy infants, de Steenhuijsen Piters and colleagues found that asymptomatic viral infections occurring in the first few months of life were associated with a strong upper respiratory mucosal interferon response that coincided with enrichment of the upper respiratory microbiota by genera containing common pathogens ( The severity of respiratory infections is also influenced by upper respiratory microbiota composition. A cross-sectional study of children and adolescents found that a microbiota profile dominated by the putatively beneficial bacterial genera  Substantial evidence links the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric infections and other infections arising from the gut.  Bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality among several vulnerable populations of children. Among premature infants, late-onset sepsis is frequently caused by gut-derived bacteria, and these infections are often preceded by loss of potentially beneficial species from the gut microbiota and an increase in the gut abundance of the BSI-causative strain [ The gut microbiota is also the major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microbes in human populations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which theoretically enables detection of all antibiotic resistance genes present within a sample (referred to as the ‘resistome’), has substantially advanced our ability to study antibiotic resistance during childhood. Several studies of the gut resistome among children have demonstrated that acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs early in life, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment or other recognized risk factors [ Adolescents account for more than half of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States [ The composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota has also been associated with the risk of HIV infection. Women with cervicovaginal microbiomes with low abundances of  The oral microbiome is integral to the pathogenesis of early childhood caries, a condition caused by specific bacteria in the supragingival plaque that create an acidic microenvironment that promotes tooth demineralization and decay. Higher abundances of  With accumulating evidence that the microbiota influences infection risk and severity, there has been substantial interest in the development of microbiome-targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of infections. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, several such interventions have been studied in infants and children. Because the gut microbiota is recognized to play a critical role in the development of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, there has long been interest in modifying the gut microbiota of premature infants through the administration of probiotics. A recent meta-analysis that included 106 randomized controlled trials of more than 25,000 infants concluded that multiple-strain probiotics, especially when combined with prebiotics, were associated with lower incidences of severe necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality, whereas single-strain probiotics combined with lactoferrin were most effective in lowering the incidence of sepsis [ Most studies of probiotics in older children have evaluated these products among children with acute diarrhea or for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or CDI. Probiotic trials conducted among children with diarrheal illnesses have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefit. For instance, in a study of a probiotic containing a strain of the yeast  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used in the management of recurrent CDI for nearly two decades, although use of this procedure in children has been limited until relatively recently. Fortunately, there have been several recent studies demonstrating that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for children with recurrent CDI. For instance, Nicholson and colleagues recently summarized outcomes of 372 patients aged 11 months to 23 years with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT at 18 pediatric health centers between 2004 and 2017 [ Phage therapy, in which viruses that target and kill bacteria (bacteriophages) are used for infection treatment, dates back more than a century; however, there has been renewed interest in phages as a result of rising antibiotic resistance. Few controlled trials of phage therapy have been conducted among children; most notably, a clinical trial of  Vaccines have contributed to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality over the past century and continue to prevent nearly 3 million child deaths each year [ Perhaps the most compelling data supporting an association between the gut microbiota and responses to childhood vaccines comes from experiments conducted in animal models. In a landmark study, Lynn and colleagues demonstrated that infant mice that were exposed to ampicillin and neomycin prior to receipt of inactivated or live vaccines developed inferior vaccine-induced antibody responses [ Findings from clinical studies of the impact of the gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity have demonstrated varied and often conflicting results ( With the recognition that the gut microbiota may influence immune responses to vaccination comes the possibility that targeted modification of the gut microbiota could promote vaccine-elicited immunity. In particular, there has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as vaccine adjuvants. Isolauri and colleagues reported that oral administration of  In conclusion, the human microbiota undergoes marked shifts in composition during early life as a result of environmental exposures. During infancy, these microbes are essential to immune maturation, promoting the generation of protective immune responses to potential pathogens and the development of immune tolerance to commensal microbes and host antigens. Throughout childhood, the commensal microbiota influences the risk and severity of infections through a complex network of microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactions collectively referred to as colonization resistance. This important function of the microbiota influences the risk of many infectious diseases that are common among healthy children and adolescents, including acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, the microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gut-derived BSIs among vulnerable groups of children, including premature infants and pediatric HCT recipients. Data from animal experiments and correlative human studies also suggest that the microbiota influences immune responses to childhood vaccines. Taken together, the studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the substantial influence of the microbiota on infectious diseases during childhood and the enormous potential of microbiome-based therapies to prevent or treat infections and promote vaccine-elicited immunity among children. Our understanding of the influence of the microbiota on childhood infections has advanced remarkably over the past several decades. However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. To date, we know surprisingly little regarding factors that shape microbial communities and their influence on infections outside of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts or in older children and adolescents. For instance, few prior studies have investigated the microbiota of the male reproductive tract and the extent to which it influences the transmission of STIs among adolescents. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of studies of the early life microbiome have focused solely on bacteria, effectively disregarding the potential impact of microbes from other kingdoms on childhood infections. Finally, there is growing recognition that the microbiome field needs to move beyond correlative studies in order to accelerate the development of microbiome-based interventions to prevent or treat infections and other diseases in children. One of the main challenges facing the field is translating what we have learned about the microbiome to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutics for childhood infections. Next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to diagnosing infections. Recently, several commercial laboratories have developed assays that enable detection of clinically relevant microbes in a variety of human samples with a short turnaround time, providing results that can be used to guide clinical decision-making. These sequencing technologies also have the potential to transform the field of infection prevention and control. Multilocus sequence typing, which involves sequencing of only a handful of microbial genes that typically represent less than 1% of the genome, remains a standard approach for the evaluation of healthcare-associated infection clusters [ Since November 2022, the first two microbiota-based human therapeutics for adults with recurrent  As sequencing technologies and analytic methods become increasingly high-throughput and accessible, we anticipate that the study of the child microbiome will advance in several ways over the next 5 years. First, there will be an increase in studies investigating the extent to which fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa influence childhood infections through both microbe-host and microbe–microbe interactions, including interspecies interactions spanning microbial kingdoms. Moreover, we will see a continued shift from simple correlative studies to translational studies that utilize novel experimental models or that integrate data on microbial gene expression, microbial and host metabolites, and host immune responses. Additionally, commercial next-generation sequencing assays will be further validated as diagnostic tools and incorporated into routine clinical practice. Eventually, in time, the pathways for regulatory review and approval will be updated to enable development of an increasingly broad range of microbiome-based therapies that reduce the burden of infectious diseases among children.","['Colonization resistance', 'gastrointestinal microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'respiratory microbiota']",2024-4-12,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,"""sti"""
11463776,Barriers and enablers that influence the uptake of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands,"Heterosexual migrant men and women in the Netherlands often face barriers to accessing health services, including HIV testing, that may lead to late-stage HIV diagnoses. This study explored factors of influence in the usage of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants. Qualitative evaluation with semi-structured interviews at the Amsterdam-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint and one focus group discussion (FGD) conducted during June-July 2023 with 19 participants: interviews with 12 heterosexual migrants from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) and FGD (n = 5) and interviews (n = 2) with 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed, using the framework of Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. In total, 55 themes emerged from the interviews and the FGD. Examples include insufficient availability of information on HIV and testing services, and difficulty in accessing these services (e.g. the barrier of the online appointment system of the Centre for Sexual Health (CSH)). HIV test participants expressed free, rapid testing, no appointment required, and a positive experience during their HIV test as enablers to test in the future. Results from key informants showed that poor health literacy and lack of clarity on the healthcare system’s guidelines were barriers for heterosexual migrants in accessing information on HIV and testing services. It also revealed past initiatives and interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the integration of HIV testing into sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, but that were subsequently discontinued due to financial constraints. Factors contributing to a low HIV test uptake were participants’ perception of limited accessibility of CSH facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies on accessing HIV/STI testing services at CSHs, and potential missed opportunities for HIV testing at general practitioners were contributing factors identified by key informants.","While much has been accomplished in the past four decades to reduce transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections, it remains a global health concern with over 39 million people affected, of whom 2.3 million people include the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [ Certain vulnerable groups being affected by HIV, such as heterosexual migrants, require more attention to ensure the UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets are reached. Stigma and discrimination continue to play roles in the low uptake of HIV testing. Gender also plays a role, with an overall higher proportion of migrant women testing for HIV compared with migrant men [ About one-third of all migrants that arrive in the Netherlands each year are from outside the EU [ Most migrants in Europe who live with HIV are often infected postmigration, which demonstrates a need for prevention and testing in countries of arrival. Studies conducted in Europe (including the Netherlands) showed that over 50% of heterosexual migrants originating mainly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Latin America, and the Caribbean acquired HIV postmigration within the first five years [ Sexual health centers (SHCs) and general practitioners (GPs) are the main providers to test for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV in the Netherlands. STI/HIV testing at SHCs is free of charge for high-risk groups (including “those who originate from an HIV/STI endemic area”) and HIV care is reimbursed through Dutch health insurance [ At the end of 2022, there were 1390 people who remained undiagnosed for HIV in the Netherlands [ The COVID-19 government regulations that negatively impacted HIV testing rates in the Netherlands requires active (tailored) case findings of HIV along with strategic scale-up of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrant groups [ To contribute to the Declarations to end the HIV epidemic, and reduce inequities in HIV testing service delivery, this study focused on heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, and aimed to explore factors of influence in the uptake of HIV testing and identify experiences on using HIV testing services. We also aimed to understand the perception of health providers and policy advisors on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among this target population. Recommendations will be formulated to inform policy makers and health providers on strategies for improving the uptake of HIV testing. This qualitative study examined the barriers and enablers of HIV testing usage among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam served as the study site being a densely populated area of more than 250,000 migrants [ The non-governmental organization (NGO) AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint was chosen as the facility to conduct semi-structured interviews (SSI) as it provides a low-threshold, no-cost rapid HIV testing service to everyone, which assisted in finding diverse participants. The SHCs, an additional NGO, and research institution served as the main organizations for key informants, including STI nurses, policy advisors, and GPs. Furthermore, the ministry of health was also approached, but was unable to deliver someone to participate in this study. Eligible heterosexual migrants met the following criteria (based on AHF Checkpoint’s HIV test assessment form): identified as female or male, were 18 years of age or older at the time of the SSI, were a migrant from an LMIC in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, or Latin America, and identified as heterosexual. Migrants living in the Netherlands less than five years were considered to be ‘short-term’, while those living in the country five years or more were considered to be ‘long-term’. The study recruited a total of 19 participants comprised of 12 HIV test clients and 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Convenience sampling was used to recruit HIV test clients for a SSI on-site at AHF Checkpoint, during the days that the interviewer was present. This was done by communicating the study guidelines to the on-site HIV test counselors to inform and invite eligible clients after their HIV test to participate without influence or pressure. A study invitation poster in English and Spanish was posted in the lobby and HIV testing office. Two study participants, who had never tested for HIV, were recruited through word of mouth by Checkpoint clients who saw the study invitation flyer. The selection criteria for key informants were that they be either a GP, STI nurse, or policy advisor, be professionally involved with HIV testing among migrants, and have a working knowledge of the English language. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit seven key informants. Key informants were invited for the FGD via email without influence or pressure. The principal investigator (PI) conducted interviews with HIV test participants and the FGD with key informants (both face-to-face) based on the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Service Use conceptual framework, using topic guides [ Two key informants could not attend the FGD and instead suggested submitting their input via a Word document using the FGD topic questions as a guide (further referred to as ‘interviewed key informants’). One interview was performed in Spanish while the rest, including the FGD, were performed in English. All respondents provided informed consent before the interviews and FGD. Permission for the PI to audio record and take written notes of the interviews and FGD was granted by all study participants. The interviews and FGD were transcribed manually immediately after each session, and the interview performed in Spanish was first transcribed before being translated into English. Anonymity and confidentiality were ensured by not asking participants for any personal identifiers and not sharing any personal information given by key informants (i.e., name, email address, and phone number). Data collection continued until no new topics emerged. For coding, a hybrid approach was taken, with the research topic guides informing the development of a coding frame matrix, including emerging themes, based on a conceptual framework (for details: see conceptual framework). The data was coded into themes and subthemes from the interviews and FGD. The data was analyzed using this conceptual framework and the latest NVIVO software was used to classify, sort, and arrange the data in order to identify themes and patterns. The study aimed to reach a diverse group of participants and triangulate data through searching for overlapping themes between the HIV test participants and key informants, and with policy documents to ensure a thorough investigation into the research topic. A number of measures were employed to achieve quality assurance: piloting and adjusting the interview topic guide, accommodating Spanish speakers, audio recording the interviews and FGD, safe data storage techniques (including deletion of interview and FGD audio recordings after the final publication of the scientific paper), and regular follow-ups with the other two researchers, and cross-checks with the last author. The study was guided by the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model (HBM) of Health Service Use, which was adapted from the Andersen-Newman 1995 Framework of Health Service Utilization [ Psychosocial factors have an impact on decision-making about planned or intended behavior related to HIV testing, using four domains: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV [ Enabling factors may influence the frequency of usage of HIV testing services. The lack of availability of appropriate resources and support to access health services and care at the individual, contextual, community/social network, and structural levels may impede care that is necessary due to the low supply of services, or financial means [ Need is related to how people perceive their own level of health and functionality (including their risk perception of HIV infection) as well as the perception from a GP or HIV test counselor on an individual’s health and needs [ The expanded Andersen HBM model was used as a framework to analyze the results of this study (deductive approach). Themes that emerged from the interviews and FGD that did not align with this framework were added separately (inductive approach). We focused on the population characteristics and health behavior elements as these were the most relevant in relation to the usage of HIV testing services. Some results sections include information gathered from the key informants that either support or contradict the findings. An overview of Anderson model main domains and emerging themes is presented in  The KIT Research Ethics Committee (REC) approved the research protocol on 25th of May 2023. Ethical aspects involved collecting verbal informed consent from all participants (audio recorded), interview data anonymously, ensuring confidentiality of participants, and applying participant codes when analyzing and using data in the results section. Furthermore, coding and transcription reliability was checked by a second researcher to ensure the process went according to the study protocol and the REC’s recommendations. Out of 12 HIV test (HT) participants, seven resided in the Amsterdam region, and five were from other regions in the Netherlands. Most were highly educated, age range was 20–47 years, duration in the Netherlands varied from 9 months up to 45 years, and several worked in information technology. Regions of origin of the HT participants were Europe, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, and North and West Africa. Of the 12 HT participants, two had never been tested, six were first-time testers, and four had previously tested between one to four times ( The psychosocial factors involved four domains regarding HIV testing: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV. The domains originated from the expanded Andersen HBM and all emerging themes (n = 55) came from the interviews and FGD (see  Knowledge of HIV (including modes of transmission) and HIV test locations were themes that were discussed. While a few HT participants could name at least one HIV transmission mode and one body fluid that can transmit HIV, the overall knowledge of HIV was low. Eight HT participants could name at least ‘blood’ as one body fluid, while two could not name any body fluids that can transmit HIV, and also incorrect examples were given, Some indicated that they briefly learned about sexual education in primary or high school, but those from Eastern Europe and the Middle East stated that it was not taught in their country of origin. The window period of HIV testing, HIV self-test, treatment for HIV and subsequently living a normal life were emerging themes among three HT participants and some key informants. As HT participant P-1 said, 
 Two HT participants understood the need to wait the right amount of time before going for an HIV test (i.e., the window period). One mentioned that he knew to wait at least a couple of months before testing for HIV in order to get a correct result, while the other who had never tested for HIV said, 
 Online (Google) searches were discussed as the main source of information on HIV and where to find HIV test locations. In addition, four HT participants named the SHC of the public health service ( 
 The attitudes of HT participants consisted of their views on HIV testing and its importance. For half of the HT participants, their visit to AHF Checkpoint was the first time they tested for HIV in their lifetime. The majority of HT participants felt that HIV testing was an important way to prevent the spread of HIV and to not only protect one’s safety, but that of others as well. First-time and repeat testing were emerging themes. While two HT participants had never tested for HIV, they held the attitude that testing is important so that one is aware of whether or not they are transmitting the virus. As one said, 
 However, another HT participant pointed out, 
 The theme of ‘repeat testing’ emerged among those who had previously tested as being equally as important in prevention of HIV infection with one stating, Four HT participants were repeat testers (i.e., had tested more than once). One participant, who had tested for the first time in the Netherlands at AHF Checkpoint and three times in their country of origin, confirmed the importance of repeat HIV testing by stating he wanted to make it a routine. Social norms consisted of the following themes: taboo, stigma, cultural perception of HIV, and cultural expectations to care, with sexual orientation as an emerging theme. The theme of taboo was prominent among most HT participants with many stating that sex remains a taboo subject in their respective cultures. While this was not stated as a deterrent to test for HIV, one participant who had never tested for HIV said, 
 HIV test-related stigma was also mentioned by several HT participants as a result of people’s perception of HIV in their culture. As one stated, 
 One HT participant stated that while HIV is talked about, sex is only mentioned in terms of abstinence-only. And, while HIV testing is available in his country, stigma remains: 
 As migrants came from different cultural backgrounds, they had varying views on expectations to care. Most stated they were accustomed to going anywhere in their country of origin for health services. As one mentioned, 
 Key informant K-1 added to this by explaining, 
 Three HT participants mentioned paracetamol as the most common practice by GPs for treatment of general health issues. One key informant (k-5) also acknowledged this, and mentioned that this could result in trust issues with GPs. Another key informant also brought this up as a potential culture shock for migrants, stating, 
 Perceived behavioral control referred to HT participants’ reasoning behind deciding (not) to previously test for HIV and the time they took to decide to test. There were two main themes: risk perception and behavioral skills, with stable relationship and condom use as emerging themes. Fear, shame, and no sexual partner were mentioned to a lesser extent. Two participants who had never tested for HIV and one first-time tester stated that being in a stable or long-term relationship was their main reason for not testing for HIV. One of the never-before HIV testers stated, 
 Shame and not having a sexual partner were mentioned by two HT participants, respectively. Fear was also mentioned by participants and some key informants, and mainly came from HT participants not wanting to know their result at the time, with one first-time tester stating he is a hypochondriac. 
 Key informant K-6 further explained in the context of HIV treatment, 
 The majority of HT participants took less than a week to decide to test for HIV from the moment they thought that they should test. For one participant, it took nine months and for another three years before the first HIV test. Enabling factors involved three domains: the availability of HIV testing services (primarily in Amsterdam, but also other main cities in the Netherlands), including the accessibility to those services, and the openness to speak about HIV and/or testing. Three HT participants came as economic migrants, four came when they were young (age range 2–14) when their families immigrated to the Netherlands. Others came for school or job opportunities). Some HT participants mentioned the availability of HIV testing services to be overall good in the Netherlands. While one participant was only familiar with AHF Checkpoint, he also knew that AHF had testing sites in other cities. As he stated, 
 Themes such as free, without appointment, and rapid testing were seen as the more important determinants to testing at AHF Checkpoint. Other themes mentioned were discreet and convenience in terms of the proximity of AHF Checkpoint and its opening hours. As one stated, 
 Easy accessibility to HIV testing services was mentioned by several HT participants. A few encountered some difficulty in accessing HIV testing services prior to finding AHF Checkpoint. One HT participant who is a long-term migrant said, 
 One HT participant was glad to have found AHF Checkpoint, as he said, 
 The SHCs at the GGDs provide testing services to those residing in their municipality and who meet certain requirements such as age and sexual preference, as stated by key informants. HT participants mentioned AHF Checkpoints having no such restrictions and people from other postal code areas are also allowed to test for HIV. Regarding the age requirement, one HT participant said, Regarding the postal code requirement, another participant stated, “ While none of the participants stated language being a barrier when trying to access HIV testing services at the SHC or GP, key informant K-3 discussed how the SHC provided an online system to make appointments, but encountered some challenges: 
 This domain referred to whether or not HT participants were able to bring up the subject of HIV and/or testing. There were three themes: family, friends, and colleagues. While a couple of HT participants felt it would be fine to approach their family about the topic of HIV (testing) and that they would feel supported, most felt that it would not be a good idea. As one participant discussed, 
 Despite several HT participants coming from conservative cultural backgrounds, the majority felt that they could speak openly with their friends. However, one participant who had never tested for HIV pointed out with regards to family and friends, 
 All HT participants said they would not discuss HIV and/or testing with their colleagues due to either feeling uncomfortable or unnecessary to do so. However, one mentioned, 
 The need factors consisted of two domains: perceived need (HT participant) and evaluated need (Key informants). Perceived need had the theme of an HT participant’s perception of HIV risk, while evaluated need had the theme of key informants’ (GPs’) beliefs on heterosexual migrants’ risk for HIV. An HT participant’s perceived risk for HIV influenced their decision to test, with unprotected sex (mostly from a one-night stand or a new partner) and physical symptoms being an emerging theme. One HT participant mentioned injecting drug use: 
 Since most HT participants had either tested for the first time in their lifetime at AHF Checkpoint or had never been tested for HIV, most had not been to a GP for an HIV test. Two HT participants, both long-term migrants, had been to a GP before to test for HIV. However, one of them who had a first HIV test at AHF Checkpoint discussed how their GP turned them away due to their low risk: 
 To further illustrate this point, key informant K-7 pointed out, 
 The usage of HIV testing services consisted of three main themes: expectations of the HIV test service, experience during the HIV test, and competency of the health providers (i.e., HIV test counselor(s)). Having a knowledgeable HIV test counselor, safe space, anonymity, no judgement, reliability of test, friendly staff, and relaxing setting were mentioned among the HT participants as expectations they had from AHF Checkpoint, with one explaining, 
 Another added, 
 None of the HT participants who had previously tested ever had a negative experience during an HIV test. Participants were asked what they would do or what their reaction would be if they were to ever have an HIV testing experience that was negative or uncomfortable. Some stated that in that case, they would still return to test for HIV for health reasons (i.e., wanting to know the result) and because it’s free. Some mentioned they would either ask for someone else at the Checkpoint to test them or go elsewhere. One HT participant was direct and said, 
 The 10 HT participants who were recruited after their HIV test at AHF Checkpoint expressed that they had a positive experience during their HIV test (two others were never-before testers). Those who experienced some anxiety or panic prior to taking the test mentioned that the HIV test counselor made them feel relaxed and at ease. However, one participant compared his experience to that of their country of origin when entering the Kilo Store (i.e., entrance of the AHF Checkpoint): 
 All HT participants stated that the HIV test counselor on duty had a strong level of competency: They named important attributes that the HIV test counselor(s) possessed: knowledgeable of HIV, reassurance, ability to handle anxiety, and ability to explain the HIV test procedure well. One of the two participants who had never tested for HIV said she would expect the person performing the test to be nonjudgmental, and the other never-before HIV tester mentioned, 
 This factor consisted of two themes: the Dutch healthcare system in relation to HIV testing (as well as general health services) and discrimination. Health literacy was an emerging theme. The majority of HT participants claimed to not know very much about the Dutch healthcare system. Three participants stated knowing that one must first register with a GP before obtaining any type of health service (including HIV testing), and that the SHC (GGD) also offers HIV testing. One HT participant expressed, however, that he already expected the SHC to not be a useful resource for him and his partner for HIV testing: 
 Another HT participant knew of a private clinic in Utrecht, but the cost was a barrier as he said, 
 One key informant mentioned that the health system in the Netherlands is decentralized, with GGD facilities serving as additional resources to the regular healthcare system. Regarding the responsibility to offer HIV testing and prevention services, she added, 
 Moreover, this key informant added to the complexity of the healthcare system in terms of STI/HIV testing: 
 Also, various key informants stated poor health literacy among migrants being the biggest problem because it impedes their ability to know how and where to go for health services. As one key informant stated, 
 All HT participants stated they did not experience discrimination during their HIV test consultation at AHF Checkpoint or when acquiring general health services in the Netherlands. External environment and its influence on the use of HIV testing services referred to two themes: place of residence, and health policies and guidelines. Most HT participants resided in the Amsterdam region, but five resided in different regions, of whom three in cities more than 30 kilometers from Amsterdam. Despite those who reside far away still coming to test for HIV at AHF Checkpoint, one key informant stated geographical availability as a barrier to HIV testing. Regarding HIV prevention awareness geared towards migrant groups, one key informant stated, 
 The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM in Dutch) guideline regarding which groups to include for STI/HIV testing at SHCs, on which financial payment is based, includes people from an endemic HIV country for HIV testing. In reality, however, it is not guaranteed that these individuals could test for HIV at their local SHC, as SHCs have some liberty to make their own priorities due to financial constraints. As key informant K-1 explains, 
 One key informant added that a full STI screening may not always be offered even if the SHC is not at full capacity. Individuals wanting further testing will be referred to their GP. HIV testing guidelines for GPs include an indicator-condition approach as well as offering routine testing to at-risk groups. However, missed HIV testing opportunities at GPs still exist, according to key informant K-3. One key informant explained how her team addressed to the ministry the importance of integrating sexual health at the national level so that cities will integrate it into their local policy. She further discussed that the general attitude of municipalities does not make it easy to find additional financing. Key informant K-3 added, 
 One key informant said the SHCs ask for one’s postal code before making an appointment, which she considered a barrier. Another key informant added, 
 When K-4 was asked whether or not people knew of this fact, she replied, 
 The perceived health status factor referred to HT participant’s perception of their overall health and the influence it has on seeking health services, including HIV testing. If participants had a perceived overall good health status, they were less likely to go to the doctor for any health service. In some cases, sexual behavior was the main reason to visit the doctor. As participant P-9 stated, 
 One of the participants who had never tested for HIV said that if she experienced symptoms of any kind, she would go to the doctor, but would not think it was HIV: 
 The evaluated health status referred to HT participants’ health being assessed by a health professional (i.e., GP or nurse), in relation to going for an HIV test. Only one participant who had tested for HIV with a GP in the Netherlands discussed, 
 Three key informants mentioned there being a lack of HIV testing even with the introduction of indicator-condition guided HIV testing due to its broad nature and GPs being uncertain of when to offer the test. Another key informant (K-5) said, 
 Key informant K-2 mentioned the efforts in trying to remedy this, 
 HT participants and key informants were asked about their suggestions on how to improve HIV testing in the Netherlands among heterosexual migrants. Some HT participants brought up the importance of awareness campaigns, outreach activities, and promotion and normalization of HIV testing (services). All key informants highlighted the need to improve the health literacy of heterosexual migrant groups, particularly men since they tend to enter into HIV care at a later stage due to the difficulty of finding their way into the healthcare system. Many HT participants felt the need to have more free testing services to remove financial barriers. One participant suggested having more HIV testing services available on Saturdays. Also, several HT participants mentioned not having enough available information regarding where to test for HIV. As one pointed out, 
 A key informant corroborated this by saying, 
 A couple of key informants mentioned past interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the HIV Transmission Elimination Amsterdam (H-TEAM), and the integration of HIV testing into other health services (e.g., prenatal screening and HIV/STI testing). However, a few key informants mentioned that the integration of HIV testing into STI testing encountered financing issues. See  This study identified factors that contributed to a low uptake of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, namely HT participants’ low knowledge of HIV (including where to test), perception of limited accessibility of SHC facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies and guidelines on accessing HIV/STI testing services at SHCs and missed opportunities for HIV testing at GPs were contributing factors identified by key informants. Low overall knowledge of HIV (including transmission routes and where to test) was present among some HT participants, despite interviews having been conducted after the participants’ HIV test counseling session (with the exception of two persons who had never tested). Despite this, the majority of HT participants believed that HIV testing was of high importance. Furthermore, long-term migrants were not very familiar with the Dutch healthcare system, even less in relation to HIV testing services, despite four being raised or living in the Netherlands since their youth. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors influenced the use of HIV testing services (including repeat testing). The main reasons HT participants tested at AHF Checkpoint were because they provide free, rapid testing, with no appointment required. The cost of HIV testing was seen as a barrier or enabler depending on the context. The free HIV testing service of AHF Checkpoint was an enabling factor that many participants stated when searching for an HIV test. Conversely, some HT participants and key informants mentioned costs at private clinics and GPs being a deterrent to testing for HIV. While an online HIV self-test was mentioned by an HT participant as an alternative to the high costs at private clinics, it was felt that the cost would still be a deterrent for most migrants. The postal code requirement and the SHC’s online appointment system were perceived as barriers by both HT participants and key informants. Key informants explained the challenges that migrants face regarding accessibility to and availability of test services. Interestingly, the participants who had never tested for HIV perceived the accessibility to HIV testing services to be overall good, but also felt that most migrants they know are completely unaware of where to test and of the requirements. Any information on HIV and testing services was mainly accessed on the internet with unavailability of information in multiple languages. Moreover, HT participants came from different countries with varying cultures, and thus had different expectations of care. However, this was more reflected in acquisition of general health services. The issues of accessibility remain a challenge in the Netherlands despite its major cities committed to translating HIV and testing information into multiple languages, and improving the access to this information that goes beyond the conventional methods used by public health institutions, as outlined by the Sevilla Declaration [ HT participants perceived their risk of HIV to be low, which led some to feel that an HIV test was previously unnecessary and others to feel that future HIV testing is needed in cases of unprotected sex. HIV testing was also considered more important for the gay community. However, as mentioned by a key informant, heterosexual men may not consider themselves gay or bisexual despite sexual interactions with other men. Also, some participants perceived condom use and being in a stable relationship as reasons to not test for HIV. As studies in the Netherlands have shown, low risk perception of HIV was more likely among heterosexual migrant men and women, and health providers do not always think about testing for HIV in the presence of HIV indicator conditions when patients are of older age [ Literature on never-before HIV tested heterosexual non-Western migrants in Europe showed the main barriers to testing as being the belief of migrants not being HIV infected and the lack of knowledge of HIV, including where to test (for no or low cost) [ Inter(national) studies have shown that fear of the test result plays a big role in not seeking testing due to perceived consequences of a diagnosis, which include social stigma from communities discovering their result [ While no participants in our study experienced discrimination or stigmatization when trying to access health services (including HIV testing) in the Netherlands, other recent Dutch studies showed the contrary [ A successful initiative to reduce HIV transmission has been the Amsterdam H-TEAM, which uses biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions to reach MSM and people who originate from countries with a high HIV prevalence [ The theoretic (expanded) framework used in this study guided the analysis on the issues raised. The hybrid analysis-approach (deductive and inductive) helped to create and find themes that were not explicitly laid out in the framework. The adaptability of the framework makes it useful in future health service utilization studies, but including the ‘predisposing characteristics’ from the earlier framework alongside the psychosocial factors instead of replacing it is recommended since it would capture more of the e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic and family size issues related to the usage of HIV testing services. In this study, the factors ‘Consumer Satisfaction’ and ‘Personal Health Practices’ were excluded since the former was already reflected in the section on ‘Experience during HIV Test.’ The latter factor was excluded since there was no difference seen between individuals with a healthy or not so healthy lifestyle linked to (ever) testing for HIV. Furthermore, the successful inclusion of heterosexual male participants in this study was also a strength that provided new insight into the (assumed) lesser willingness of heterosexual migrant men to test for HIV. Despite the HIV test counselors on duty being female (with the exception of a male test counselor on one day of data collection), a larger willingness to participate was among males. Data collection from both HT participants and key informants allowed for confirmation of results (data triangulation). We included two people who had never before been tested for HIV and six first-time testers. Different perspectives were obtained through the recruitment of participants from countries with various cultures and religions. Additionally, a variety of key informants from different work backgrounds provided a well-rounded discussion on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among heterosexual migrants. Two key informants, however, were unable to participate in the FGD and provided responses on our questions on paper. Consequently, these key informants were not able to share and exchange experiences with other key informants, which is a limitation. Having a diverse group of HT participants may have also had some limitations, e.g., not always having males and females within each migrant group. Furthermore, convenience sampling in one location in Amsterdam may have affected representativeness of the study, especially since participants from rural areas were not included, potential issues (e.g., distance to SHCs) that were found in Dutch studies did not play a role in our study [ While language was not presented by HT participants as a major barrier, it does not mean that this barrier does not exist. The selection criteria tool was only available in English and Spanish. As a result, there was potential selection bias with migrants either speaking English or Spanish. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of migrant populations, they cannot be seen as one cultural group, which limited the study in focusing on specific migrant sub-groups. Similarly, factors like poverty, employment, and lack of education remain issues in accessing HIV information and testing services, but our participants were relatively well-educated. Moreover, our study was unable to delve into the political aspect of health system financing (except for some statements about a broader involvement of the municipality in providing additional finance for testing) and its influences on the use of health facilities and health providers in providing HIV information and testing services. This study found several factors that pose a barrier to HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors are key in understanding why and how migrants use HIV testing services, but the inclusion of other components (of the framework) is also crucial in helping to assess inequalities in accessing these services. AHF Checkpoint was considered by HT participants to be a convenient and easily accessible HIV testing facility. Recognizing the importance of all components can guide policy makers in using evidence-informed interventions to improve the access to and availability of HIV information and testing services in the Netherlands. The input received from HT participants and key informants helped create recommendations (Tables  (DOCX) (DOCX)",[],2024-10-9,PLOS ONE,"""sti"""
11462721,Female transactional sex workers’ experiences and health-seeking behaviour in low-middle income countries: a scoping review,"For a variety of reasons related to biology, behaviour, and environment, a subset of a population known as female sex workers (FSWs) or female transactional sex workers is at increased risk of health, depression, social stigma and access to timely and quality healthcare when needed. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there was lack of understanding regarding the experiences and healthcare utilisation and behaviours, the health burden among them, their experiences, and how they access health care. Using Anderson’s behavioural model of health service utilisation as a framework, this review aimed to explore the experiences of, and healthcare seeking behaviours of female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries. Six relevant databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1990 and December 2023 that discussed female transactional sex work in low- and middle-income countries. Subject terms such as: low-and middle- incomes, sex workers (female and male), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the sex work industry, prostitution, commercial sex, and health-seeking behaviour were used for the databases search. Out of 6,135 articles that were retrieved for the study, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Of the total number of studies, four were reviews, eight were quantitative studies, six were qualitative studies, and two utilised mixed methods. Results from a thematic analysis of studies that combined quantitative and qualitative methods yielded six overarching themes.The study found that women engaged in sex work for different reasons – to fend for themselves (i.e., livelihood), self-employment and others do it for pleasure. However, force sex or unprotected which can lead to sexually transmitted infections, sexual abuse, job insecurity, were critical risks factors in engaging in sex work. These factors make them vulnerable to predators and health risks. It was found that sex workers were aware of the importance of seeking healthcare, and do make the efforts, however, crucial factors such as difficulty accessing healthcare and maltreatment by healthcare providers and social stigma disincentivises FSW health-seeking behaviours. Sexual workers reported discomfort disclosing their occupations because of the stigma and discrimination which further affects their regular health examinations and obtaining medically approved condoms from healthcare facilities. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare afflict female sex workers in LMICs. The maltreatment and stigma can potentially affect LMICs from achieving using health facility care, with potential implications on achieving the universal health coverage goals. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs."," Female transactional sexual behaviour is associated with public health problems worldwide and presents many conceptual challenges for researchers [ The health and well-being of female sex workers (FSWs) are greatly impacted by a number of issues and vulnerabilities that are specific to the profession in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, FSW in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should not be overlooked as a minor aspect of the social and economic crisis. Governments are becoming more aware of the problems and dangers faced by sex workers and their health-seeking activities [ In addition, the environment in which FSWs conduct their business often vary and with different experiences, thereof. According to a qualitative study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, FSWs meet clients online as well as in real-world settings like venues and outdoor areas. Due to the criminalisation of their profession, the women involved reported experiencing severe stigma, assault from customers and authorities, and difficulties getting access to healthcare. Those who used online venues faced extra dangers, including extortion and cybersecurity threats [ In urban versus rural settings, FSWs may have very different experiences. Though there is more competition and violence in urban areas; therefore, FSWs may have better access to clients and services [ However, the universal health coverage (UHC) principles are widely championed because a population’s healthcare-seeking behaviour (HSB) has a major impact on a country’s health status and, as a result, socioeconomic growth [ It includes factors such as the type of provider, adherence to treatment, reasons for choosing a professional, and reasons for not seeking help. The environment’s characteristics significantly influence individuals’ decisions to seek healthcare, with specific characteristics determining their HSBs [ The literature has shown that many FSWs face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, preferring informal providers due to fear of stigma and discrimination. Studies show that up to 70% of FSWs avoid public health facilities due to discrimination, stigma and mistreatment concerns [ This review draws on Anderson’s model of health-seeking behaviour Fig.  Health service utilization model. Source: Adapted from Saah; Andersen and Davidson [ Thus, this study aim to explore their sex work experiences and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of female sex work in LMICs, addressing the unique challenges faced by sex workers. It highlights the complexities of healthcare utilization and the social, economic, and security threats to their livelihoods, thereby enabling the development of public health efforts and interventions [ To find relevant research, this review conducted a comprehensive mapping of studies that focused on commercial or transactional sex work and the health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) of female sex workers. The following steps proposed by Arksey and O’Malley’s [ These searches were conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, the author conducted a thorough search for non-traditional sources of information, as well as examined the reference lists of all relevant studies that were found, in order to uncover any more research papers that align with our search criteria [ A systematic search was conducted on published literature within these popular databases in the field health, psychology and social sciences. The following keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were combined in the searches: “transactional sex work” OR “commercial sex work” “prostitute” OR “prostitution” OR “sex work” OR “sex worker” OR “female sex workers” OR “STIs” OR “health-seeking behavior” AND “low-middle income countries”. The study included studies published between 1990 and 2023. This was the period within which discussions on HIV/AIDS and STIs’ among female sex workers became prominent in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa [ Relevant components of the study aims, methods used and the findings were extracted and summarised. Out of 6,347 articles found using the database and manual search, 1,215 made it through the title and abstract screening process after duplicates were removed. After the screening, 202 studies were considered eligible for assessment, and 22 studies were ultimately selected after triangulation by three (3) separate reviewers. The final tally for the papers included in the analysis was 26 after screening and adding 3 prior review studies (Fig.  
 PRISMA flow diagram adopted for studies included in this systematic scoping review: Study identification, screening, exclusions and final inclusions after assessing studies full texts (Page et al., 2021) The relevant information in the articles used in the study were independently extracted, examined, and synthesised relative to the experiences and healthcare-seeking behaviours of FSWs. Three colleagues with advanced expertise in review studies were engaged to assess and triangulate the findings obtained from the summaries of the findings, focusing on factors that resonate with the study’s objective. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained and presented using narrative synthesis to understand the factors [ The twenty-six articles included were published between 1990 and 2022 of which twelve articles were published in 2012, 2013 and 2015 [

 Summary of mapped studies included in the systematic scoping review 
 Summary of Factors 
 Summary of Factors Affecting Health Seeking Behaviour (HSB) of prostitutes Demographics and socioeconomic variables commonly identified and discussed in these studies included age, marital status, level of education, family background, ethnicity, religious backgrounds and poverty. In 80.8% ( In 19 (73.1%) studies participants identified factors that led them to female transactional sex work. FSWs indicated that the primary factor influencing their decisions to work in the area of commercial sex was that, they were from poor financial background, had no job, did not have any identifiable sources of income and found it difficult to fend for themselves [ Respondents in other studies involving FSWs in Nigeria and others in public Universities in Ghana, provided a list of reasons for entering into the sex work industry that extended beyond money or material benefits. A subset of participants in the study provided the following explanations:  From the analysis, female sex workers (FSWs) revealed that the majority of male clients exhibit resistance in regards to condom usage prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. The vulnerability of younger sex workers was heightened by their inexperience and lack of proficiency in bargaining, leading to difficulties in advocating for condom use during sexual encounters. FSWs also mentioned issues of vulnerability to extortion by state security personnel such as Police Officers, who sometimes would abuse sex workers physically, and demand unprotected sex. Most cultures in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) frown upon transactional sex work. Thus, sex workers commonly reported discomfort discussing their profession, accessing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing, and when they need approved and affordable condoms from the local health clinics [ Several studies have revealed dangers associated with violence or sexual assault perpetrated by clients. The circumstances that are thought to increase the vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to violence include visiting a client’s residence, engaging in nocturnal sessions, and meeting unfamiliar individuals at unknown locations [ The iteration of the results show that FSWs visit drinking bars and night clubs in and around urban areas at night in search of customers, whilst others operate in rented rooms (i.e. hotels, guest houses, and brothels). There were other categories such as those who provide escort services to clients. These categories are highly paid female sex work and involve sexual encounters by appointment with an exclusive client. Such FSWs leave their mobile phone contacts and pictures in hotels and guest houses in, and around their respective areas of operations, to be contacted by prospective customers in Mainland China, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria and similar LMICs [ Studies maintain that once they are selling sex, they are also trying to avoid abuse from clients and law enforcement agencies, such Police Officers. It was found that FSWs sought love and to build a future. Therefore, FSW indulge in romantic relationships with young men without prior medical screening for health status including sexually transmitted infections [ Analysis of factors influencing health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) was based on Andersen’s behavioural model of healthcare utilisation [ Andersen indicates that although predisposing and enabling factors are necessary for health service utilisation, they are not sufficient explanations for “actual use” of healthcare. “Actual use” is initiated by need, which might arise as a result of level of the health condition [ In this study, enabling factors at the female sex worker (FSW) level included wealth and income at the her disposal to cover the cost of assuming positive health-related lifestyles such as good nutrition, physical exercising, wearing of condom, engaging in other safe sex practices and good personal hygiene [ At the individual FSWs level, the model differentiates between perceived need for health services, which refers to how individuals perceive and experience their own health status (such as self-rated health, functional state, and illness symptoms), evaluated need, which involves objective measurements of FSWs’ health status, health screening, and need for health care [ The enhanced healthcare seeking behaviour among FSWs can be attributed to their apprehension of developing the intricate type of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their increased awareness about health, as shown in studies in Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and other LMICs [ Two articles reported that women engaged in street-based sex work, whether separated or married, were more likely to seek health services from clinics or hospitals, when compared to those who were not or never married [ The study aimed to synthesize existing findings on female sex workers experiences, survival strategies, and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. The findings revealed that female sex workers had a high level of formal education, were primarily between the ages of 12 and 35, were either gainfully employed in other sectors or unemployed, and had financial needs. Female sex workers (FSWs) who were married or separated showed an increased likelihood of seeking healthcare. However, FSWs faced challenges in seeking healthcare due to derogatory and discriminatory behaviours towards them, high healthcare fees, and discrimination and maltreatment from providers. Generally, the majority of women involved in transactional sex work experience various degrees of vulnerability. Thus, FSWs’ increased awareness of health concerns and their desire to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) motivated them to seek healthcare. Some FSWs engaged in the act to earn a living, while others primarily engaged in sex work for the fun of it. The majority of the studies examined indicate that most women engaged in sex work at the age of 12 or older had received some level of formal education. These women faced a lack of opportunities to earn income, and many considered dropping out of school as a pivotal moment in their lives, which aligns with existing literature [ First, male clients’ non-adherence and prioritisation of heath protection. Crucial concerns of their health was high, due to clients’ refusal, and deliberate uncooperative attitude towards condom usage during sexual service provision, and incidents of violence. It is worth noting that clients’ refusal to cherish and use sexual protection was closely linked to ‘power and control imbalances’ in the transactional sex work business, as well as the ‘terms’ of ‘contract’ between commercial sex workers and their male clients. From the results, the male clientele tends to exert more dominance in the entire negotiation process. In this context, the use of condoms during transactional sexual interactions is an essential aspect. A quick scan of the literature demonstrates that unprotected sex exposes the lives of FSWs and their clients, to STIs including HIV. Indeed, there was high HIV prevalence in the sex work industry. For example, in 2012, the World Bank report on the health of sex workers showed that across all regions, HIV prevalence was 11.8%, and 36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa, with Malawi (70.7%), South Africa (59.6%), Kenya (45.1%), Rwanda (24.0%) [ Second, health and bodily security were crucial findings from literature. The findings have shown that FSWs were susceptible to multiple problems of health risks, violence and physical harm. Indeed, concerns relative to sexual violence, rape, condom failure, and instances of police officers’ misconduct, were mentioned. These led to concerns of anxiety about contracting HIV through rape and unprotected sex [ Female sex workers faced multiple human rights violations. The results have shown that issues of discrimination and class concerns existed and how women’s bodies were turned into commodities for distinct ulterior motives. Indeed, increased criminalization and social stigmatisation, potentially leading to further discrimination from health providers, hindered their access and utilisation of health facility care [ Finally, the study found that FSWs felt compelled to use healthcare, aligning with Andersen’s healthcare usage model. In nearly all of the included articles, FSWs showed increased health awareness and self-reported health screening in locations such as Mainland China [ Key strength of the study stems from its geographical coverage and the wide duration which allowed saturation of data on the themes. The study also included articles from The study was guided by Anderson’s healthcare utilisation model; meanwhile different frameworks were used to analyse female sex workers experiences and health seeking behaviours in the included studies. The subject investigated has cultural and health implications, and thus, the non-inclusion of cultural nuances in the search may have left out relevant articles. However, given the saturation of the findings in the themes, it is believed, additional articles may only support what has been found. Despite the novel findings presented in this study, they must be read against the backdrop of the following limitations. The review investigates the experiences of female sex workers, and their health-seeking behaviours in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it does not (and cannot) address all of the concerns with geographical distinctiveness in low- and middle-income countries in one study. Further, some articles were not available in full text or freely accessible via search engines for inclusion in the data set. However, the anticipated effect of non-access to the full texts, which are less likely to be published in low impact factor journals, may be to add only a number of supporting articles to the already established themes. Finally, female sex work has shifted from traditional brothel-based sex work to internet-based sex work and a mix of different types, over the last years. The vulnerabilities faced by women in sex work depend on the type of sex work they are engaged in, whether it’s brothel-based, street-based, massage parlour-based, internet-based, or other forms of transactional sex. However, this study could not explore these nuances, which has limited the conclusions relative to the vulnerabilities across the broad spectrum of female sex work. This study recommends further studies in these areas for policy, social intervention and health programming. The review’s findings validate several notions outlined in Anderson’s health seeking model, specifically that socio-demographic factors like education, occupation (particularly sex work), and the effectiveness of medications or pharmaceuticals are inadequate for determining the utilisation of conventional healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, the utilisation of orthodox health facilities by FSWs was not significantly influenced by age or marital status. The study also discovered a noteworthy relationship between the vocation of sex work and the practice of self-medication. Variables such as age, education, marital status, work status, and work experience did not show a significant correlation with self-medication from the literature. The findings have shown that female sex work in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents complex policy challenges with significant implications for public health, human rights, and social welfare. Overall, policies regarding female sex work in LMICs should prioritize the rights, health, and well-being of sex workers while addressing the broader social, economic, and structural factors that shape their experiences. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare services was found to negatively impact female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was found that female sex work was motivated by the need to earn living although others engaged in the business for the love it. Nevertheless, FSWs were exposed to multiple risks of sexually transmitted infections, threats of sexual and physical violence against them, as well as human rights violations from clients and law enforcement agencies. Indeed, access to health facility for healthcare become problematic due to discrimination and stigma by healthcare providers. The maltreatment and stigma meted to FSWs, potentially inhibits their health outcomes, the countries attainment of universal health coverage goals, and without access to care for FSWs, HIV could become an endemic health problem. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs. Furthermore, to address the factors relative to healthcare seeking behaviours of FSWs, there is an urgent wake-up call to ensure comprehensive, non-discriminatory, and accessible healthcare is available to improve their healthcare utilisation.","['Commercial sex work', 'Prostitution', 'Transactional sex', 'Low-middle income countries']",2024-10-9,BMC Public Health,"""sti"""
11462516,Microstimulation-based path tracking control of pigeon robots through parameter adaptive strategy,"Research on animal robots utilizing neural electrical stimulation is a significant focus within the field of neuro-control, though precise behavior control remains challenging. This study proposes a parameter-adaptive strategy to achieve accurate path tracking. First, the mapping relationship between neural electrical stimulation parameters and corresponding behavioral responses is comprehensively quantified. Next, adjustment rules related to the parameter-adaptive control strategy are established to dynamically generate different stimulation patterns. A parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy (PAPTCS), based on fuzzy control principles, is designed for the precise path tracking tasks of pigeon robots in open environments. The results indicate that altering stimulation parameter levels significantly affects turning angles, with higher UPN and PTN inducing changes in the pigeons' motion state. In experimental scenarios, the average control efficiency of this system was 82.165%. This study provides a reference method for the precise control of pigeon robot behavior, contributing to research on accurate target path tracking.","The evolution of microelectronics and biomedical technology has given rise to a distinct category of animal robots, diverging from traditional robots. In this paradigm, animals replace mechanical structures, and neuroelectric stimulation serves as a control command transmitted to the sensory or motor cortex, enabling the manipulation of specific behaviors. This synthesis capitalizes on the inherent locomotion capabilities of animals while addressing energy supply challenges [ Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing passive stimulation modalities to target specific motor brain areas in pigeons, thereby controlling distinct motions [ Current neuroregulation methods include deep brain stimulation (DBS) [ Research on the behavioral regulation of bio-robots has demonstrated that organisms can respond to deep brain stimulation patterns to perform specific movements. It has been observed across different species that the success rate of behavior control can be significantly enhanced by flexibly configuring stimulation parameters. Additionally, it has been proven that external information, when encoded through electrical stimulation and transmitted to motor execution brain regions, can reliably induce behavioral responses. While neuroelectric stimulation can be used for encoding sensory information that the central nervous system translates into corresponding motor outputs, excessive electrical stimulation may compromise the effectiveness of behavioral responses and lead to neuronal inactivation [ Previous studies on the optimal stimulation parameters and patterns for controlling the movement of pigeon robots have indicated that the integration of multiple pulse modes is more effective in meeting the complex demands of animal behavior control. However, these studies have not accounted for the varying rotational requirements at different moments during the control task, which can lead to overcorrection and cause the subject to sway back and forth along the target path, resulting in an ""8"" path. In recent years, this issue has been addressed by adjusting stimulation patterns to guide and control rat robots in performing corresponding movements and successfully developing an autonomous navigation system for rat robots [ Therefore, establishing a real-time parameter-adaptive control algorithm is essential for accomplishing complex path tracking tasks in pigeon robots. Addressing the limitations of single stimulation mode control, which fails to meet the adaptive requirements of dynamic systems, this paper proposes a parameter-adaptive control strategy for pigeon robot path tracking. A feedback control system based on fuzzy control principles has been designed to enable precise tracking of target paths by pigeon robots in open environments. To implement this autonomous control system, the movement state must first be detected. This involves using target region segmentation techniques to locate the pigeon robot and calculate real-time position errors and their trends. Next, by analyzing the mapping relationship between parameter levels and behavioral responses, a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy is formulated. Finally, output parameters are dynamically adjusted based on the control requirements at different stages of the task, with diverse stimulation modes employed to achieve precise and prolonged control of pigeon behavior. The proposed parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategydemonstrated exceptional navigation performance in a bidirectional open-field environment. In this study, seven adult pigeons (Ph1, Ph2, Ph3, Ph5, Ph7, Ph9, Ph10) with an average age of 2 ± 0.3 years and a body weight exceeding 400 g were selected. Both male and female pigeons were included. The pigeons were housed individually in wire cages under normal light-dark conditions, with free access to water, nutrient-rich soil, and a mixed diet. All animal experiments described in this paper were reviewed and approved by the Life Sciences Ethics Review Committee of Zhengzhou University (No. SYXK 2019–0002), in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A bidirectional open test field, measuring 2.7 × 1.8 m, was used in this study, as shown in  Experimental model design and pigeon robots. (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental site. (b) Experiment with a pigeon robot wearing a wireless neurostimulator. (c) Wireless neurostimulator. (d) Electrode converter PCB circuit diagram. The neuromodulation phase is preceded by 3–5 days of forward training. Pigeons underwent a period of food deprivation exceeding 24 h, and water, food, and nutrient soil were positioned at the end of the field. The feeding site served for rationing, with 2 g of food administered at a time. Upon their initial arrival at the feeding site, pigeons were relocated to the starting point. During this phase, they foraged and returned to the starting point undisturbed. This pre-training process instills in them the motivation to walk forward. This training methodology proves highly effective in control experiments, as it allows the animals to return to the starting point undisturbed, thus minimizing stress from external factors and enhancing their capacity for autonomous decision-making. First, the pigeons were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium pentobarbital (0.14 ml/100 g). Once the anesthesia took effect, the feathers on the head were shaved, and 2% lidocaine (0.2–0.3 ml) was administered subcutaneously for local anesthesia. The pigeons were then secured in a specially designed stereotaxic apparatus (Model 68027, RWD Life Sciences, Shenzhen, China), and the FRM region (AP: 3.90 mm, ML: 1.45 mm, DP: 8.0 mm) was selected as the implantation site based on the pigeon brain atlas (Karten and Hodos, 1967). The brain region is illustrated in  Schematic of FRM Brain Region Stimulation Electrode Implantation. (a) Anatomical diagram of the pigeon brain. (b) Localization of the FRM brain region. The wireless neural stimulator from the literature reference [ The stimulator output pulse was configured as a biphasic constant-current square wave with cathodic precession, maintaining a total charge output of zero. This design aimed to alleviate the adverse effects of DC stimulation on the target nucleus, ensuring that bi-directional pulses did not introduce charge bias within or outside the neuronal membrane [ Neuroelectrical stimulation initiates a firing response in neurons through the delivery of an external electrical charge to the designated brain area, eliciting a shift in membrane potential. Neuroactivity is contingent on the cumulative charge imparted to the neural tissue, a value influenced by pulse parameters, stimulation modes, together with the electrode materials and implantation locations. Current research indicates that both higher stimulation intensity and longer stimulation duration have a greater impact on pigeon behavior, while more frequent single stimulations result in increased damage to brain tissue. Based on these findings, the primary stimulation parameters used in this study, as illustrated in  PF: Defined as the number of pulse signal cycle changes per second, expressed as PF = 1/T, where T represents the time of the unit pulse cycle. UPN: Refers to the quantity of unit pulses within a unit pulse sequence. PTN: Indicates the count of unit pulses within a pulse sequence. PA: Denotes the peak value of current per unit pulse.

The black arrow represents the current body direction of the pigeon, the angle between the hollow arrows is the steering angle before and after electrical stimulation, and the distance between the center of gravity of the pigeon's body is the travel distance before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we set the duty cycle ( Parameter conditions used for experiments on the relationship between parameter levels and behavioral responses. All experiments quantifying the behavioral responses to stimulation parameters were conducted using the method of controlling variables. The increments for stimulation parameters were 25 Hz for frequency, 1 pulse for UPN, 1 train for PTN, and 0.1 mA for amplitude. To ensure the robustness of the behavioral control study, parameters that reliably induced behavior were established as initial values. The initial stimulation parameters, determined from post-surgical verification experiments, were 50 Hz for frequency, 4 pulses for UPN, 3 trains for PTN, and 0.2 mA for amplitude. To minimize the impact of sequential increments on statistical analysis, a pseudorandom sequence was used to determine the order of testing parameters. Each test focused on the effect of a single parameter on behavior, with neural stimulation repeated 10 times in the FRM brain regions of both the left and right sides of all subjects to ensure the reproducibility of behavioral induction. To ensure the robustness of the behavioral control study, the parameters that could stabilize the evoked behavior were established as the initial values. The initial stimulation parameters derived from postoperative locus validity experiments were determined to be 0.2 mA, 50 Hz, 4 sizes, and 3 strings. All experiments were conducted using the controlled variable method and employed biphasic constant current pulse stimulation. The PF, UPN, PTN, and PA were then randomized for adjustment, with unit increments of 0.1 mA, 25 Hz, 1 size, and 1 string, respectively. Each set of trials focused on a single parameter and was repeated 10 times in both the right and left FRM of all subjects to ensure the reproducibility of effects. To mitigate the impact of sequence increment on statistical analysis results, a pseudo-randomized sequence was used to determine the order of the tested parameters. Accurate and efficient detection methods will enhance the operational efficiency of the online control system. In this paper, we employ the HSV-based color space to extract the motion state of the pigeon robot [ To assess the significance among different parameter levels inducing rotation behaviors (as presented in  Each parameter level was iterated 10 times in both the left and right brain areas of each subject. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to explore variances between individual rotation behaviors and parameter settings, with the significance level set at 5% (∗, p < 0.05). LSD post hoc analysis was employed to examine the impact of parameter level selection on rotation behavior [ Pigeons can autonomously determine their behavior based on the environmental context. Pigeons usually exhibit specific behaviors by their inherent motion patterns, deviating from our expectations if the deviation from the target path is not suppressed. Consequently, the automatic navigation system of animal robots exhibits significant randomness. The use of a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy allows for pre-adjustment of the pigeon's motion path. This helps in restraining impending transgressions or instances of control loss during the tracking. Furthermore, it will avoid path fluctuations caused by system hysteresis control. The fuzzy control algorithm does not rely on an accurate model of the controlled system and is capable of managing uncertain systems. Using this method, a path tracking control system for the pigeon robot was established, as illustrated in  Pigeon robot path tracking control system and strategy. (a) Design block diagram of pigeon robot path tracking control system. (b) parameter adaptive path tracking control strategy control rule. The positional information ( To prevent tolerance development due to frequent electrical stimulation, errors within the pigeon's body width ( When  When | To comprehensively assess the control strategy's performance, two parameters are defined. The task-averaged error rate α evaluates the accuracy of the control strategy in tracking the target path, while the control efficiency η assesses the system's effectiveness in successful experimental trials. An efficiency level ( Statistical evaluation of system repeatability in multi-individual, multi-trial experiments is performed through the control efficiency ( Rapidity requirement:  Accuracy requirement:  The task is deemed successful when both conditions are met; otherwise, it is considered a failure. The duration taken to stabilize the foraging route during pre-training was recorded as the freely foraging time ( In this section, we analyze the impact of varied parameters on the motion behavior of pigeons within a two-way open field. Simultaneously, we discuss the tracking performance of the automatic control system. Our objective is to achieve the autonomous tracking of the pigeon robot along a predefined path in an open-field scenario and enhance tracking accuracy through PAPTCS. To ensure experiment reliability, pigeons undergo a fasting period exceeding 12 h before any test, ensuring their predominant forward momentum originates from food. Following each test, the experimental site undergoes meticulous cleaning, ventilation, and a half-hour drying period before subsequent experiments. The experiment successfully collected data from five pigeon robots, with the results illustrated in  Impact of PF/Hz on RA and TD Behavioral responses of individual subjects to different levels of stimulation parameters. As the frequency increased from 25 Hz to 100 Hz, RA on the left side decreased from 144.55° to 77.52°, while TD decreased from 8.39 cm to 6.65 cm. A similar decreasing trend was observed on the right side, where RA decreased from 103.45° to 49.76° and TD from 10.26 cm to 6.57 cm. The increase in frequency led to a reduction in both RA and TD, suggesting that high-frequency stimulation may suppress the pigeon's response. Although the trends on both sides were similar, the RA and TD on the right side were smaller than those on the left. A strong positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on the left side (r = 0.89), but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.11, p > 0.05). On the right side, a very significant positive correlation was found between RA and TD (r = 0.99, p = 0.013, p < 0.05), indicating a higher level of synchronization under frequency variations. Impact of UPN/Size on RA and TD As the number of unit pulses increased from Size 3 to 6, both RA and TD increased on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 79.49° to 175.87°, and TD increased from 6.12 cm to 10.12 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 60.92° to 153.14°, and TD from 6.74 cm to 13.44 cm. Although RA on the right side was slightly lower than on the left side, the increase in TD was more pronounced, indicating a more significant impact of pulse quantity on the right side. A strong positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on the left side (r = 0.92), but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.081, p > 0.05). On the right side, the positive correlation was stronger and significant (r = 0.97, p = 0.033, p < 0.05). Impact of PTN/String on RA and TD As the number of pulse trains increased from 2 to 5, both RA and TD increased on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 74.82° to 199.35°, and TD increased from 6.21 cm to 10.03 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 56.84° to 144.76°, and TD from 6.99 cm to 12.82 cm. A very strong and significant positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on both sides (Left: r = 0.95, p = 0.047; Right: r = 0.98, p = 0.021), indicating that the trend of influence due to the number of pulse trains is consistent across both sides, with a greater magnitude of change on the right side. Impact of PA/mA on RA and TD With increasing amplitude, both RA and TD showed significant increases on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 8.48° to 189.27°, and TD from 0 cm to 15.77 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 0° (no response) to 172.72°, and TD from 0.94 cm to 15.33 cm. A very strong and highly significant positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on both sides (Left: r = 0.99, p = 0.007; Right: r = 0.99, p = 0.011), demonstrating that changes in amplitude can precisely control the pigeon's motor responses. Next, a detailed analysis of the relationship between stimulation parameters and behavioral responses will be provided using the Ph2 individual as an example. A detailed analysis is provided using stimulation of the left FRM brain region in the Ph2 individual as an example. Results of pigeon motion and behavior stimulated by different parameters. The extent of motion response in pigeons exhibited a direct correlation with the stimulus parameters, as illustrated in  The degree to which different stimulus parameters changed the locomotion state of pigeons. (a, b, c) Represent rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PF, respectively. (d, e, f) Represent rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter UPN, respectively. (g, h, i) Represent the rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PTN. (j, k, l) Represent the rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PA, respectively. The thick black lines in Figs. j, k, and l indicate that all trials are generated stably; the rectangular boxes indicate the range of state switching for all trials. Note: ∗ indicates that there is significance between the two (∗, p < 0.05). ▲ represents that the pigeon switches from a stationary state to a walking state at the end of the motion; ⚪ represents that the pigeon responds quickly and moves rapidly; ★ represents that the pigeon loses its body balance at the end of the motion. It was observed that the parameters UPN and PTN significantly influenced the RA ( PA exhibited a positive correlation with both RA and TD. In contrast to the other parameters, PA displayed a distinctive “threshold"" for behavior control, beyond which the pigeon robot initiated behavioral responses. Notably, both RA and TD showed significant increases at PA = 0.3, with angular increments strongly correlated with PA increments ( The average success rate across the five individuals was 78%, with Ph2 achieving the highest success rate of 90%, while Ph10 had a success rate of 60%.  The results of trial 2 for pigeon Ph7 are depicted in  The tracking effect of PAPTCS on complex paths. (a) Path tracking effect of successful trial 2. (b) Path tracking effect of successful trial 5. (c) Path tracking effect on failed trials, accuracy did not meet system design requirements. (d) Path tracking effect on failed trials, rapidity did not meet system design requirements. Task failure can arise from two scenarios. The first one is depicted in  Another scenario is depicted in  Number of crossing times of the second route. Note: The first two out of ten experiments of the pigeon robot Ph1 were failed attempts, so only attempts 3–10 were counted. The system output parameters for the test 6 are detailed in  Variable parameter control policy parameter. Note: The bolded portion of the table shows the state quantities and neuromodulation pulse parameters of the pigeon robot in the Path 2 section. Performance indexes of parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy. Note: The reasons for experimental failures are highlighted in bold italics within the table, and the failed trials are marked in red font. Different from the drawbacks associated with the optimal parameter control method, which may result in excessive control of the pigeon robot, the control strategy proposed in this paper anticipates the pigeon robot's motion trend in the subsequent moment through the incorporation of the error rate of change  The performance indicators of Ph1 are illustrated in  Performance indicators of the control system. ANOVA conducted on successful trials yielded non-significant differences between the control efficiency (p = 0.675, ANOVA) and the task average error rate (p = 0.692, ANOVA). These results suggest that an increase in the number of trials did not influence control performance. However, a noteworthy inter-individual significant difference emerged in task completion time (p = 0.036, ANOVA), highlighting a discernible individual effect on the task completion time for the tracking task. Electrical stimulation methods targeting sensory or motor brain areas are widely employed for the automatic control of animal robots. However, a challenge lies in dynamically selecting optimal stimulation parameters. To address this issue, this study proposes a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy for pigeon robots. Through the exploration of multiple sets of parameter levels, we identify combinations with minimal charge accumulation, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the control system. Notably, previous studies on automatic control of path tracking in animal robots lack research regarding parameter adaptation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of research on the control of pigeon robots in open scenarios utilizing parameter adaptive control strategies. In pursuit of a stable, efficient, and enduring path tracking control system for pigeon robots, a comprehensive examination of various parameter levels and stimulus pattern combinations is imperative. This study systematically delves into and delineates the mapping relationship connecting independent variables of parameters to dependent variables of behavior. Subsequently, this mapping relationship is harnessed to devise adaptive strategies for parameter design. Physiological studies on animals have demonstrated that lower stimulus frequencies are ineffective in activating neurons for excitation, while an appropriate frequency range induces behavioral responses in motor neurons [ Generally, an escalation in PTN and UPN is associated with a concurrent rise in the number of directly activated neurons, likely contributing to the pronounced increase in RA and TD in the pigeon robot. Electrophysiological investigations have consistently demonstrated that the level of neuron activation is contingent upon the total effective charge applied to the brain [ Biological responses triggered by electrical nerve stimulation are intricately associated with the phenomenon of neuronal depolarization. The cathodic precursor's stimulus pulse waveform induces an efflux of intracellular positive charge, diminishing the cell membrane potential and prompting neural tissue excitation. External electrical stimulation, for inducing neural excitation, necessitates a pulse amplitude surpassing the action potential's minimum threshold. The action thresholds of all individuals, except for the Ph2 right FRM, exceeded 0.2 mA in this study. Following initial stimulation, cells rapidly enter an excited state, with their excitability enduring for a defined duration [ In the behavioral analysis of the pigeon robots, significant variations in rotation angles were observed among different stimulus parameter levels and, in specific instances (e.g., UPN and PA parameters of Ph1), between travel distances. This outcome indicates that the FRM predominantly performs neural activities associated with body rotation, with alterations in travel distance representing a consequential adaptation to body rotation. Notably, a majority of individuals ( Under the experimental conditions, a strong positive correlation between RA (rotation angle) and TD (travel distance) was observed for both the left and right sides. This indicates that as stimulation parameters increase RA, TD also increases correspondingly, and vice versa. Overall, the correlation on the right side was found to be stronger and more significant compared to the left side (with right-side correlation coefficients exceeding 0.95 and p-values less than 0.05 across all experimental conditions), suggesting that individual behavioral responses under right-side stimulation are more consistent. In the frequency adjustment experiments, the correlation between RA and TD was significant on the right side (r = 0.99, p = 0.013), while a strong correlation was observed on the left side but was not statistically significant (r = 0.89, p = 0.11). In experiments involving the number of pulses (UPN/Size) and pulse trains (PTN/String), both sides exhibited significant positive correlations, particularly on the right side (r > 0.95), indicating that these parameters have a consistent impact on motor behavior across both sides. The effect of amplitude (PA/mA) variations on RA and TD showed a very strong correlation on both sides (r > 0.98, p < 0.05), with a particularly strong correlation on the left side (r = 0.99, p = 0.007), demonstrating that amplitude variations can precisely control the individual's motor responses. The outcomes of this study align with observations from the rat robot, wherein animals exhibited abrupt rotation motions in response to high-amplitude stimuli. The animals concluded their response within a duration of 3–4s following stimulus application. After the cessation of the stimulus pulse, neurons gradually returned to the resting state within a timeframe of 1.5–2.5s [ Stimulation patterns exert a direct influence on the extent of motion response and the transition between behavioral states in pigeon robots. The animal motor conditioning system selectively engages distinct functional subareas of the FRM and specific motor neural pathways to accommodate rotation requirements in varying rotation scenarios. The wireless neurostimulator generates diverse neuromodulation pulses targeting the designated brain area. This diversity in stimulation modes serves to prolong the brain's tolerance, ensuring sustained system efficacy over the long term. Furthermore, it enhances the system's capacity to control pigeon behavior [ Overall, the behavioral patterns of the five individuals under different stimulation conditions showed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that the research results are both replicable and reliable. The stable patterns observed across different stimulation parameters provide a solid foundation for further development of neural control systems. To attain a specific control objective, the design of diverse stimulus patterns is imperative to concurrently elicit desired physiological responses, such as inducing visual perception, generating limbic behaviors, or facilitating a specific task. These responses manifest externally and internally, characterized by factors such as the rate of activation, the volume of activated tissues, and the duration. Effective control over these effects is achievable through the control of microelectrical stimulation parameters. Traditionally, optimal stimulation parameters are selected as the control system output based on an individual's response characteristics to pulse parameters. However, this approach fails to meet the precise control requirements for tracking the target path during the system's operation. The primary reason is that biological behavior is influenced by multiple factors, resulting in a non-linear relationship between parameters and behavioral responses, with significant variations among individuals. Additionally, path tracking is a highly dynamic and real-time task that demands the control system to possess self-adjusting capabilities. Fuzzy control principles can simulate the response of different individuals to parameters and generate stimulation patterns that meet the real-time requirements for precise path tracking. This approach allows for pre-control of boundary behaviors, resulting in smoother trajectories for the pigeon robots and preventing the occurrence of ""8"" paths. The results of this study reveal that the control success rate exceeds 80% for most individuals, except for individual Ph10, and notably achieving 90% for Ph2. The average error rate in experiments is predominantly below 50%, highlighting the impracticality of pursuing full controllability akin to mechanical robots for animal counterparts like pigeon robots, which possess intrinsic cognitive processes. The design of control strategies for animal robots should align with the external environment of creatures and intentions. Moreover, the average control efficiencies in experiments consistently fall within the efficient control range, reaching an impressive 93.1577% for Ph7. This indicates that the behavioral decisions of the pigeon robot can be effectively influenced through applied neuroelectric stimulation, facilitating the execution of desired actions and the successful accomplishment of tasks specified by human operators. In contrast to prior investigations [ The difficulty of the control process may be influenced by multiple factors. Research indicates that an individual's age and cognitive level can affect behavioral responses. In studies on locusts, older locusts typically respond more quickly to threats than younger ones, which helps to explain instances of control failure observed in the early stages of experiments [ Using controllable biological robots for biological research enables the simulation of most scenarios required by researchers while avoiding the species rejection responses commonly encountered in mechanical robot simulations. This approach is of significant importance for a deeper understanding of animal social interactions, spatial cognition, and navigation [ This study also promotes interdisciplinary research across fields such as biology, robotics, biomedicine, and environmental science. For instance, robotic rehabilitation systems enable precise control to deliver repetitive motion training while minimizing human error. Neurostimulation technologies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), directly activate the nervous system to facilitate neurorepair and neuroplasticity, aiding in the recovery of motor function. Combining neurostimulation with robotic rehabilitation allows for dynamic adjustment of therapeutic parameters based on patient needs, enhancing the effectiveness of personalized rehabilitation [ Additionally, the use of controllable biological robots in biological research enables the simulation of most experimental scenarios while avoiding the species rejection reactions often encountered in mechanical robot simulations. This approach also reduces the uncertainty and variability introduced by live animals in traditional experiments, thereby improving the reproducibility and accuracy of research[ Neural electrical stimulation offers significant advantages in controlling animal robots, providing essential technical means for research in animal robot behavior control. This study validates the feasibility of the pigeon robot path tracking control system from a system design perspective and demonstrates the system's effectiveness on the ground. In the design of automatic control systems for flight-capable biological robots, although strategies for controlling specific behaviors through the intervention of pigeon intentions have been successfully implemented in laboratory settings, external environmental effects on pigeon movement intentions have not been considered due to the limited number of experiments and individual differences. Additionally, there is a lack of feedback mechanisms related to the awareness of the biological entities. Future research should focus on integrating the intrinsic behavioral intentions of animals with human interventions to design more effective control systems at the level of animal intentions. Additionally, due to the inherent challenges in interpreting subjective experiences of animals, humans typically rely on observable behaviors and physiological responses to assess emotional expression. Therefore, a deeper investigation into the control mechanisms of emotion-related neural clusters and the subjective perception of external stimuli will significantly advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms of neural regulation.

11461730,Elucidation of the pluripotent potential of bovine embryonic lineages facilitates the establishment of formative stem cell lines,"The establishment of epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from cattle, which are important domestic animals that provide humans with milk and meat while also serving as bioreactors for producing valuable proteins, poses a challenge due to the unclear molecular signaling required for embryonic epiblast development and maintenance of PSC self-renewal. Here, we selected six key stages of bovine embryo development (E5, E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14) to track changes in pluripotency and the dependence on signaling pathways via modified single-cell transcription sequencing technology. The remarkable similarity of the gene expression patterns between cattle and pigs during embryonic lineage development contributed to the successful establishment of bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) using 3i/LAF (WNTi, GSK3βi, SRCi, LIF, Activin A, and FGF2) culture system. The generated bEpiSCs exhibited consistent expression patterns of formative epiblast pluripotency genes and maintained clonal morphology, normal karyotypes, and proliferative capacity for more than 112 passages. Moreover, these cells exhibited high-efficiency teratoma formation as well as the ability to differentiate into various cell lineages. The potential of bEpiSCs for myogenic differentiation, primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs) induction, and as donor cells for cell nuclear transfer was also assessed, indicating their promise in advancing cell-cultured meat production, gene editing, and animal breeding.

This study provides valuable high-quality seed cells and novel avenues for investigating pluripotency in stem cells from livestock species while advancing research on stem cell-related breeding and cultured meat production. To elucidate the molecular basis of early bovine embryonic development and changes in pluripotency, combined with our insights into embryonic development in domestic animals, we optimized single-cell collection from bovine embryos at key time points (E5, E6, E7, E10, E12 and E14) (Fig.  Single-cell transcriptome sequencing deciphers lineage differentiation of bovine embryos.  In summary, single-cell transcriptome sequencing of bovine embryos comprehensively delineated embryonic lineages and accurately depicted the differentiation trajectory of each germ layer lineage. To investigate the dynamics of epiblast pluripotency and elucidate its characteristics across different developmental stages, we selected six stages of epiblast development for subsequent analysis: E5 pre-ICMs, E6 ICMs, E7 ICMs, E10 EPIs, E12 EPIs, and E14 ECTOs. After dimensionality reduction by the UMAP algorithm, we observed a distinct clustering pattern among these six stage-specific cell types, which specifically formed two clusters: E5–E7, and E10, E12, and E14 (Fig.  Tracing the dynamics of pluripotency of bovine embryonic lineages.  To gain further insights into the existence of the naïve, formative, and primed pluripotency stages during epiblast development in bovine embryos and to elucidate the underlying core regulatory signaling pathways involved, we performed pairwise comparisons to classify the 2267 differentially expressed genes from the aforementioned six-stage cells into 16 clusters (Table S4). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of representative genes associated with naïve pluripotency, such as  JAK/STAT3 pathway is sufficient for the establishment of naïve pluripotency [ Based on the analysis mentioned above, we believe that the E5-E7 pre-ICMs/ICMs are in a naïve pluripotent state, the E10-E12 EPIs are in a formative state, and the E14 ECTOs are in a primed state. These results characterize the molecular underpinnings of pluripotency in bovine epiblast development, and suggesting that the maintenance of bovine formative epiblast pluripotency relies on the activation of the FGF/ERK and TGFβ/SMADs signaling pathways, while the supplement with LIF and suppression of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways aligns with our observations in pig early embryos [ We next investigated the similarities and discrepancies in changes in pluripotency during bovine and porcine embryonic lineages development. To mitigate potential bias in stage mismatches between species, we initially conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman’s correlation analysis. PCA of bovine and porcine embryonic lineages revealed tight clustering of samples according to developmental stage and time (Fig.  Comparative analyses of developmental and pluripotency changes of embryonic lineages in cattle and pigs.  We posit that the establishment of stable epiblast stem cells, it is necessary to effectively maintain the self-renewal of bovine epiblasts while simultaneously inhibiting their spontaneous differentiation. As previously described, bovine EPIs exhibit responsiveness to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling, while the maintenance of self-renewal necessitates suppression of WNT signaling and activation of TGFβ/SMADs and FGF/ERK pathways. The regulatory mechanisms governing pluripotency in bovine and pig embryo lineages demonstrate remarkable similarity. Therefore, our objective was to establish bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) using a modified 3i/LAF culture system, which includes the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021, SRC inhibitor WH-4–023, WNT inhibitor IWR-1-endo, as well as LIF, Activin A, and FGF2. This culture system has been successfully utilized for the establishment of porcine pgEpiSCs [ Generation and characteristics of bEpiSCs.  Given that the E10 EPI represents a critical stage of formative pluripotency, we specifically chose E10 bEpiSCs for subsequent pluripotency assays and observed positive alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining in the colonies (Fig.  To investigate the impact of different cytokines and small molecule inhibitors incorporated into the 3i/LAF culture system on the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of bEpiSCs, we performed individual factor reduction to assess the functions of these molecules. Using 3i/LAF-cultured bEpiSCs as a control group, we replaced the factor-deleted medium after 12 h of passaging bEpiSCs. After 48 h of culture in factor-depleted medium and observation of cell morphology and AP staining, substantial flattening, loss of clear boundaries, and evident differentiation were observed in the bEpiSCs clones from the IWR-1-endo (IWR)-depleted group. In contrast, the bEpiSCs clones from the FGF2-depleted group exhibited significantly slower proliferation rates with smaller clone volumes and more severe cellular apoptosis (Fig.  3i/LAF are essential for the long-term subcultured of bEpiSCs.  To investigate the functions of three small molecule inhibitors related to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in bEpiSC pluripotency and self-renewal, we collected third-generation bEpiSCs cultured with CHIR99021 (CHIR)/IWR/WH-4-023 (WH) depleted separately for differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. The analysis revealed that the removal of any WNT-related small molecule resulted in aberrant expression of the core pluripotency genes  The combination of CHIR and IWR was shown to maintain mouse EpiSC and human ESC self-renewal [ We further examined the effects of FGF2, Activin A, and LIF on the pluripotency of bEpiSCs and found that depletion of FGF2 resulted in dysregulation of the core pluripotency regulatory network and multilineage differentiation of bEpiSCs (Fig.  The single-cell transcriptomic features of bovine embryos serve as an unequivocal benchmark for assessing the pluripotency status of bovine embryo-derived stem cells. To further assess the gene expression characteristics and pluripotency status of bEpiSCs, we initially compared the single-cell transcriptomic data of bEpiSCs obtained from bovine embryos at different stages with those of bovine embryonic lineages (Table S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the developmental and pluripotency characteristics of bEpiSCs were strongly related to those of the E10-E12 epiblasts (Fig.  Transcriptomic profiling of bEpiSCs.  Next, we conducted a comparative analysis of bulk RNA transcriptomes between bEpiSCs established in this study and bovine PSCs reported previously, including primed bESCs [ To investigate the similarities and differences between bEpiSCs and pig pgEpiSCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression of these two cell types using bulk RNAseq data. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed no significant differences in pluripotency maintenance (e.g.,  In summary, we successfully established bovine formative EpiSCs, which exhibit distinct gene expression characteristics from other published bovine PSCs. We propose that bEpiSCs show good potential for myogenic differentiation, primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) generation and as donor cells for genome-edited animal cloning (Fig.  Potential applications of bEpiSCs.  In this study, utilizing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns during critical developmental stages in early bovine embryos. Our findings revealed the occurrence of a transition from naïve to formative and primed pluripotency states during the early embryonic epiblast development of bovine embryos. Specifically, we observed downregulation of LIF/STAT3 signaling-related genes during the transition from naïve to formative EPIs, while WNT/β-catenin signaling-related genes were upregulated during the transition from formative to primed EPIs. These results further underscore the evolutionary conservation of embryonic development and the regulation of pluripotency in artiodactyla (between cattle and pigs). Utilizing the optimized 3i/LAF culture system, we successfully established bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) based on the conserved early embryonic development observed in pigs and cattle. These cells demonstrated long-term stability, maintained a normal karyotype, exhibited characteristic features of formative epiblasts, expressed pluripotent marker genes, possessed the capacity for three germ layer developments both in vitro and in vivo, and displayed typical stem cell pluripotency. The bEpiSCs cultured under the 3i/LAF condition in this study exhibit characteristics of formative pluripotency. For the perspective of culture system, both FGF2 and WNT inhibitor were widely used in the culture of bPSCs except bEPSCs (for which FGF2 is not essential for bEPSCs self-renewal). The 3i/LAF culture system used in this study showed potent utility for the pluripotency and self-renewal of bovine formative PSCs. The addition of LIF was able to increase the pluripotency of epiblast stem cells in the presence of Activin A and FGF2 [ Notably, bovine bEpiSCs and porcine pgEpiSCs display remarkably similar clonal morphologies, pluripotency profiles, and transcriptomic profiles. This comprehensive investigation enhances our comprehension of both the commonalities and distinctions regarding embryonic pluripotency dynamics among livestock species. Moreover, bEpiSCs exhibit a robust potential for myogenic differentiation, thus providing a novel avenue for advancing cultured meat production. Additionally, bEpiSCs can be induced to differentiate into PGCLCs or utilized as donor cells for genome-edited cloned embryos, suggesting innovative prospects for subsequent developments in stem cell breeding and genome-editing techniques. In our previous work, we established a transcriptome map of single cells from porcine preimplantation embryos, which served as a valuable reference for the current project. Due to the similarities in embryonic development between cattle and pigs, coupled with animal welfare 3Rs requirements and logistical challenges associated with obtaining bovine embryos, we opted not to sample continuously but instead to select representative stages of embryonic development for analysis. Through comprehensive transcriptome analysis, we demonstrated that the gene expression patterns observed during these selected embryonic periods effectively captured the key characteristics of developmental progression at each stage without compromising subsequent investigations. Moreover, the critical determinant of embryo and stem cell chimerism lies in their developmental stage compatibility. Due to the derivation of bEpiSCs from pregastrulation embryo epiblasts and the lack of experimental techniques for verifying chimeric potential by injecting bEpiSCs into bovine gastrulation embryo epiblasts, as well as the absence of suitable in vitro culture conditions for gastrulation embryos and challenges associated with in vivo observation of gastrulation embryos, conducting experiments on embryo chimerism was deemed impractical.

 CD-1® (ICR) IGS and BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and were used for mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolation, and the bEpiSCs teratoma formation test. The MEFs were treated with mitomycin C (Selleckchem, S8146) to prepare feeder cells for bEpiSCs. Holstein cow embryos at E5, E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14 were used for bovine embryonic single-cell collection and single-cell transcriptome analyses. Embryonic day n (E(n)) embryos were obtained n days after mating. For bEpiSCs derivation, E7, E10, E12, and E14 embryos were used. The embryonic cells utilized in this study were exclusively derived from Holstein cow embryos. E5-E7 embryos were obtained by thawing and culturing frozen cow embryos until the desired developmental stage was reached. The zona pellucida was subjected to a 15–30 s Pronase (Sigma, 10,165,921,001) treatment, followed by cleaning and removal using a solution composed of DPBS + 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the embryonic cells were mechanically separated and transferred into the lysate. E10, E12, and E14 embryos were obtained through in vivo transplantation and subsequent flushing, with single embryonic cells being isolated and collected via a combination of enzymatic treatment and mechanical manipulation. The components of the bovine epiblast stem cells culture system were the same as the 3i/LAF culture system previously reported [ Bovine ICMs, epiblasts, and ectoderms were isolated by mechanical isolation and treated with TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) for 3 min, then seeded onto feeder cells supplemented with 3i/LAF medium. Cultures were incubated at 5% O Single-cell RNA-seq library was prepared using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol, as previously described in studies [ The growth curve of bEpiSCs was plotted by seeding them at a density of 3 × 10 Bovine EpiSCs were digested with TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) and filtered through a 40 μm cell filter. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates with 100, 500, and 1000 cells, respectively. After 3 days of culture, the number of colonies formed was counted, and the single-cell colony formation rate was calculated and averaged. Before performing karyotype analyses, 1% KaryoMAX Colcemid Solution (Gibco, 15,212,012) was added to the bEpiSCs culture medium and incubated for 1 h. The bEpiSCs were then dissociated into single cells using TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) and collected through centrifugation. Subsequently, the bEpiSCs were suspended in a hypotonic solution of 0.075 M KCl (Sigma, P5405) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following this step, the bEpiSCs were fixed with methanol and acetic acid in a ratio of 3:1; this process was repeated three times. The resulting suspension of bEpiSCs was dropped onto a pre-cooled slide, thoroughly dried at room temperature, and stained with a 10% Giemsa Stain Solution (Sangon, E6073140001) for a duration of 30 min. More than 45 metaphase cells were examined for each cell line. For details about AP staining procedures and precautions, refer to Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore, SCR004). The cells were washed with DPBS for immunofluorescence (IF) analyses, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with DPBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After another round of DPBS washing, the cells were blocked with 3% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C and subsequently washed three times using a wash buffer (DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times using the same wash buffer. Finally, DAPI staining was performed to visualize the nucleus, enabling direct observation and photography. Following digestion, the bEpiSCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 The prepared 1 × 10 The teratomas were subjected to two washes in DPBS and fixed with 4% PFA for a duration of 2 days at a temperature of 4 °C. Subsequently, the teratoma tissues underwent dehydration using an alcohol gradient (70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and finally, 100% for each hour) before being transferred into xylene and embedded in paraffin. The samples were sliced to a thickness of 5 μm, followed by deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration using decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Finally, the samples were stained with haematoxylin (Sigma–Aldrich, MHS16) and eosin (Sigma–Aldrich, HT110116), after which they were observed under a microscope (Leica, DM5500B). The total RNA was extracted from bEpiSCs using the RNA prep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (TIANGEN, DP430), followed by reverse transcription to cDNA using the 5 × All-In-One RT Master Mix (Abm, G490). Subsequently, PCR amplification was performed with the 2 × RealStar Green Power Mixture (GenStar, A311-05) on an Archimed Real Time System (ROCGENE). The data were analyzed utilizing the comparative CT (2 The protocol was performed as described for pig pgEpiSCs [ The induction of PGCLCs was conducted according to a modified protocol [ Total RNA was extracted separately from four bEpiSCs samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74,106). For constructing strand-specific RNA-seq libraries, we employed a rRNA depletion protocol (Globin-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit, Illumina, GZG1224) in conjunction with the NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, E7420S). All libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Q32851) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The GFP plasmid was stored in our laboratory. In brief, we generated a PB-CMV-EF1A-GFP-NLS plasmid by modifying the PB-CAG-MCS vector (provided by Prof. Sen Wu). Specifically, we substituted the chicken β-actin promoter with the  Bovine EpiSCs were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen, L3000008). Specifically, transfection was performed 16 h after normal cell passage in a 24-well plate. First, 25 μL Opti-MEM™ Medium was added to a centrifuge tube followed by the addition of 0.75 μL Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent and mixing well. Then, another centrifuge tube was taken and filled with 25 μL Opti-MEM™ Medium to which 0.5 μg DNA and 1μL P3000™ Reagent were added and mixed well. The DNA mixture was then combined with the Lipofectamine™ reagent at a ratio of 1:1 and allowed to incubate for10-15 min before being added to the cells for culture. Ovaries were obtained from cattle farms around Beijing, and oocytes in 3–8 mm follicles were extracted. The oocytes with three layers of cumulus cells were transferred to Maturation medium and matured at 38.5 °C and 5% CO For the STRT-seq dataset, Raw reads were split by 8 bp cell barcodes located on Read 2 allowing 2 mismatches. Additionally, the 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) located on Read 2 were switched to the identifier line of paired Read 1. Then Read 1 was processed to remove the template switch oligo (TSO) primer, low quality bases and polyA sequence [ To pre-process our bovine data, we loaded the entire raw count matrix dataset with metadata using Seurat (v-4.1.0.9) [ Sequencing reads for each gene were normalized and scaled in each cell after regression on the mitochondrial gene ratio and cell cycle scores by “ Based on the differentiation process during embryonic development, we grouped the bovine embryonic cells into three main lineages: embryonic lineages, covering pre-ICM at E5, ICM at E6 and E7, epiblasts at E10 and E12, and the ectoderms at E14; TE lineages, including pre-TE at E5, TE at E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14; and hypoblast lineages, including hypoblasts at E10, E12, and definitive endoderm at E14 (Fig.  To trace the dynamic changes of DEGs during embryonic development, we constructed the expression tendencies of DEGs in epiblast lineages. We first calculated the average expression levels for each gene at specific embryonic development time points in each respective lineage separately. The average expression levels were rescaled for embryonic lineage and analyzed by the k-means clustering method with parameters k = 10 and iter.max = 100, grouping the DEGs with similar tendencies during embryonic development into separate clusters.

11460714,The expectations humans have of a pleasurable sensation asymmetrically shape neuronal responses and subjective experiences to hot sauce,"Expectations shape our perception, profoundly influencing how we interpret the world. Positive expectations about sensory stimuli can alleviate distress and reduce pain (e.g., placebo effect), while negative expectations may heighten anxiety and exacerbate pain (e.g., nocebo effect). To investigate the impact of the (an)hedonic aspect of expectations on subjective experiences, we measured neurobehavioral responses to the taste of hot sauce among participants with heterogeneous taste preferences. By identifying participants who “liked” versus those who strongly “disliked” spicy flavors and by providing contextual cues about the spiciness of the sauce to be tasted, we dissociated the effects of positive and negative expectations from sensory stimuli (i.e., visual and gustatory stimuli), which were the same across all participants. Our results indicate that positive expectations lead to modulations in the intensity of subjective experience. These modulations were accompanied by increased activity in brain regions previously linked to information integration and the placebo effect, including the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a predefined “pleasure signature.” In contrast, negative expectations decreased hedonic experience and increased neural activity in the previously validated “Neurological Pain Signature” network. These findings demonstrate that hedonic aspects of one’s expectations asymmetrically shape how the brain processes sensory input and associated behavioral reports of one’s subjective experiences of intensity, pleasure, and pain. Our results suggest a dissociable impact of hedonic information: positive expectations facilitate higher-level information integration and reward processing, while negative expectations prime lower-level nociceptive and affective processes. This study demonstrates the powerful role of hedonic expectations in shaping subjective reality and suggests potential avenues for consumer and therapeutic interventions targeting expectation-driven neural processes. Can positive and negative expectations of a sensory experience cause neuronal and perception differences? This study shows that sensory experiences and neuronal responses are shaped by whether a person likes spicy foods, suggesting that perception could be pharmacologically modulated.","Expectations, triggered by contextual signals in the environment, have a profound impact on how humans make sense of and react to the world [ Placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia are examples of how positive or negative expectations can relieve or enhance, respectively, human sensory experiences. Although both placebo and nocebo effects exert modulations in the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [ Recent placebo and nocebo studies have demonstrated how positive and negative expectations can modulate sensory and emotional responses and highlight the complexity of expectation effects and the interplay between different neural circuits, including endogenous opioid and descending pain modulatory system (DPMS), as well as reward system [ A recent meta-analysis found only small placebo effects on a neurologic pain signature (NPS), a neural measure that sensitively and reliably tracks changes in nociceptive input and self-reports of pain that arise from it [ One’s expectations can be complex compositions that include both sensory and hedonic components. Sensory expectations adhere to stimulus qualities, such as sensory modality and intensity. By contrast, hedonic expectations are beliefs about the degree to which one will like/dislike a stimulus [ To address the question of how subjective experiences and neural responses are modulated by positive versus negative expectations (with expectations of sensory intensity controlled), we used a behavioral paradigm where participants continuously rated their subjective experience of stimulus intensity and variations in their associated hedonic experience while ingesting squirts of high- and low-intensity hot sauces or water. As an objective sensory input, we used hot sauces with variable, but quantifiable, amounts of capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in chili peppers that activates TRPV1 receptors on nociceptive neurons to produce a sensation of burning. This input allowed us to selectively activate a robust, receptor-specific sensory experience while controlling the intensity of an objective sensory cue [ Participants undergoing fMRI scanning tasted squirts of high- and low-intensity hot sauces, as well as squirts of water ( ( Presenting the neutral cue run before the intensity cue run was strategically chosen to establish a baseline response to the neutral cue before introducing the potential interference or contamination from intensity cues. This approach allowed us to probe the participants’ preferences before the potential inference of expectation manipulation. To increase the dynamics of changes in taste sensations during the task, we implemented a rinsing protocol. Before each of the 30 test squirts in both runs, participants received a rinse squirt of water ( We first pooled all participants ( Participants were recruited without advertising that the research was investigating “spicy” sauces. Once consented for a “sauce tasting” experiment, participants were told that the sauces may or may not be spicy; they were told that sensory experience may be pleasant or unpleasant according to their preference for spiciness, and then had the option to opt out if concerned. Despite this disclaimer, we were able to recruit comparable groups of participants who disliked ( Large individual differences in preference for the tasted sauces were demonstrated by the correlation of sensory ratings and hedonic ratings of each participant ( Although the interaction of group (liking group, disliking group) × stimulus (high, low, water) × expectation manipulation (neutral cue, intensity cue) for the heat rating was not significant,  Top 2 rows: heat intensity ratings; bottom 2 rows: like ratings. ( In terms of neural responses as measured by fMRI, only the liking group showed a significant effect for the contrast of  ( Interestingly, the response to squirts in the pleasure signature identified by a previous meta-analysis [ The interaction of group × stimulus × expectation manipulation for the like rating was not significant,  In the disliking group, the responses of the NPS [ ( We further explored whether the sensory or the affective aspect of the NPS was more likely modulated by the negative expectations in our task. We conducted ROI analyses within each of the key regions: S1 and thalamus (sensory); insula and amygdala (affective). We found a significant interaction between stimulus and expectation manipulation in the response in insula to squirts,  By controlling the intensity of sensory input and pairing these stimuli with visual cues, we found that the subjective experience of spiciness, as well as activations in AI and DLPFC, were modulated by expectations about the intensity of spiciness. Furthermore, by differentiating positive and negative expectations based on individual differences in hedonic preference for spicy taste, we demonstrate that, when the sensory expectations remained the same, positive expectations decreased the reported heat intensity and increased responses in AI, dorsal ACC, and DLPFC, as well as a predefined pleasure signature [ The effect of expectation has been observed in previous studies with different types of stimuli (e.g., beverages [ Importantly, our findings provide novel insight over previous observations into the influence of expectations on subjective states and preferences [ On the one hand, in people who preferred the spicy sauces, the subjective experience of spiciness intensity changed after simply observing a predictive visual cue that generated an expectation of capsaicin intensity. These expectations also induced increased activation in the AI, dorsal ACC, DLPFC, and areas in the pleasure signature for spicy sauces, but only in the group that liked the spicy sauces. These findings suggest a specific neural effect of positive expectations. Psychophysiological changes driven by positive expectations have been proposed to be a key underlying mechanism for placebo effects [ The increased activations in dorsal ACC and DLPFC induced by positive expectation echo the result from a recent meta-analysis identifying increased DLPFC and ACC responses associated with placebo effect [ On the other hand, in people who did not like the spicy sauces, visual cues that predicted the spiciness intensity did not change their subjective rating of capsaicin intensity, but these cues did significantly decrease their rating of the pleasantness of the sauce tasting compared to the same sauces tasting without intensity-predicting cues. This behavioral finding suggests a specific exacerbation of discomfort induced by negative expectations. However, we should hasten to note that while we observed distinct effects within the liking group and disliking group, respectively, these should not be interpreted as differences between the groups in the absence of significant interaction effects. Interestingly, negative expectations also induced stronger NPS responses, a validated measure that tracks levels of nociceptive pain [ Our findings indicate an asymmetric effect of hedonic expectation on sensory experience. Specifically, positive expectations (intensity cues) led to a significant reduction in the perceived spiciness of the low sauce in the liking group. This modulation was not observed in the disliking group or for high sauces in either group. The lack of significant interaction for high sauces may suggest a ceiling effect, where the high baseline intensity of spiciness might have limited the modulatory impact of expectations. This highlights the nuanced nature of sensory modulation by expectations, indicating that positive expectations may only significantly alter sensory perception when the stimulus intensity is not overwhelming. This asymmetric effect underscores the influence of hedonic predisposition on how sensory expectations are processed and perceived. In summary, the current study brings novel insights into the interplay of psychological and neural processes underlying the interaction between mind, body, and environment. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on the mechanisms of hedonic expectations by demonstrating neural and behavioral responses to positive and negative expectations. Earlier studies that induced positive or negative expectations showed modulated sensory and emotional responses [ The study has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written consent to participate in the study, and all procedures were approved by Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board (approval number: VT IRB# 11–377). Fifty-three participants enrolled in the current study. Among them, 48 participants completed the 2 runs of tasks while undergoing fMRI scanning. The other 5 participants who only completed the first run of the task were excluded from data analyses. One participant was excluded because they did not respond behaviorally in the second run of the task, which leaves 47 subjects in total who completed the experiment (23 females, 30 ± 11.4 years old [mean ± SD]). Finally, only 1 participant did not show a significant correlation (positive or negative) between their heat intensity and sauce preference ratings and was excluded from further analyses. None of the participants have a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. As shown in the left panel in  On the scan day, while the participant was lying in the scanner, high and low sauces, as well as water were delivered into the participant’s mouth, one squirt at a time, through 3 tubes (one for each type of squirt) bundled by a mouthpiece ( In the first run, a total of 60 squirts of sauce or water were delivered into the participant’s mouth, one squirt at a time. Among them, 30 test squirts, including 10 water squirts, 10 low squirts, and 10 high squirts, were delivered in a randomized order. In addition, 1 water squirt (a rinse squirt) was administered before each of the 30 test squirts to rinse and restore the participant’s mouth to a baseline level prior to the next test squirt ( The second run was nearly identical to run 1, except that the visual pepper cues were colored to indicate the heat intensity of the upcoming squirt ( A Spearman’s rank-order correlation comparing the participant’s ratings of “heat” and “like” during run 1 (there were no expectations about sauce spiciness intensity cued) was conducted to determine their preference for the spicy sauces (see  For each participant, the subjective rating of experienced heat on a 0 to 10 scale (integers from 0 to 10) was converted to z-scores which made each participant’s heat ratings have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (see  We first conducted a 3-way ANOVA test of group (between-subjects: Liking group, Disliking group) × stimulus (within-subjects: high, low, water) × expectation manipulation (within-subjects:  The subjective rating of flavor preference was also converted to z-scores within each subject. The z-scored heat ratings were interpolated with ZOH at 0.1 s intervals and then baseline-corrected by the average rating during the 5 s before the cue display. We also conducted a 3-way ANOVA test of group × stimulus × expectation manipulation on the average like rating during the saturated phase. After that, a repeated 2-way ANOVA test of stimulus × expectation manipulation was also done within each group on the average like rating during the saturated phase, followed by post hoc tests checking the effect of expectation on each type of squirt in each group. Imaging was conducted on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner. High-resolution T1-weighted scans (voxel size: 0.479 × 0.479 × 1.0 mm) were acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (Siemens). Functional images were acquired using echoplanar imaging (repetition time = 2,000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; 34 slices; voxel size: 3.44 × 3.44 × 4.0 mm). Images were analyzed using SPM12 ( General linear models (GLMs) were specified for each participant (first-level analysis). All visually and orally delivered stimuli and motor responses were modeled in the design matrix that was constructed by convolving each event onset with a canonical hemodynamic response function in SPM12. Residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the estimated 6 motion parameters for each participant as covariates. Low-frequency drifts were removed using a high-pass filter (128 s cutoff). Beta maps at squirt delivery were estimated respectively for each regressor at each run for each participant and then entered into group-level analyses. After dividing participants into the liking group and the disliking group, we tested how positive and negative expectations manipulate brain responses to spicy taste by conducting a whole-brain contrast: (sauce To examine the activations in pleasure/reward-related brain areas, we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis using a mask of pleasure signature identified by a previous meta-analysis [ To quantify the NPS response, the signature response was estimated for each test subject by taking the dot product of first-level activation images with the signature pattern, yielding a continuous scalar value. From there, to test whether NPS response was specifically sensitive to negative expectation, we ran a three-way ANOVA test of stimulus (sauce, water) × expectation manipulation ( Statistics on behavioral data were implemented using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

11460426,Prevalence of syphilis and associated factors among pregnant women in Brazil: systematic review and meta-analysis,"This systematic review accompanied by a meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil and describe its associated factors. Following the establishment the search strategies and the registration of the review protocol in PROSPERO, we conducted a search for relevant articles in the Pubmed, LILACS, Science Direct, SciELO and Web of Science databases. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional studies published between 2005 and 2023, with no language restrictions. The combined prevalence of syphilis infection was estimated using the random effects model in the R Software with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and p < 0.01 as statistically significant. A total of 24 articles were recruited, which together investigated 221,884 women. The combined prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil was 1.79% (95% CI: 1.24-2.57%), and the main factors associated with its occurrence were black and brown skin color, low education and factors related to the partner. There was a high prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy in Brazil, mainly associated with socioeconomic factors.","Syphilis is considered a serious public health problem. Although there are preventive measures and accessible and effective treatment options, its prevalence is increasing worldwide, bringing several consequences for health, especially during the gestational period. Among the factors that contribute to the high prevalence of syphilis in Brazil, sociodemographic characteristics like black and brown skin color, low socioeconomic status, low education and, above all, failure in prenatal care can be observed. The mandatory registration of cases of Gestational Syphilis (GS) on SINAN has been established in Brazil since 2005. It is believed that knowledge about the prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy in the country and its possible associated factors, based on studies with primary data, can provide subsidies for the establishment of public health policies aimed at controlling and preventing the disease, in order to interrupting its chain of transmission and preventing negative outcomes and fetal deaths resulting from congenital syphilis. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis among pregnant women in Brazil and describe its associated factors. This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed based on the  The source was conducted in october 2023. Scientific articles published in journals and available in six electronic databases through advanced search. Were used:  In addition, references were also consulted to check whether studies not found in the databases. All retrieved studies were exported to the Rayyan application for deduplication and title, abstract and full-text screening by three independent researchers. The inclusion criteria adopted were: cross-sectional studies available in full, carried out in Brazil, reporting the prevalence of syphilis and/or possible associated factors and published in any language in the period between 2005 and 2023. The choice of this period is due to the beginning of the syphilis in pregnant women's notification in Brazil, representing a milestone in the epidemiology of syphilis. We excluded incomplete articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, case reports, literature reviews and studies that reported only the prevalence of syphilis acquired and congenital, excluding the gestational form. The titles and abstracts were read by three of the authors (IMO, BCTM and RCS), independently, to verify possible duplicate studies, as well as to meet the pre-established inclusion criteria. After an initial selection, eligible studies were read in full by the authors to compose the sample. Cases of disagreement between researchers were resolved by another researcher (RAS). Also independently, a predefined form was used by the two researchers to extract the following data from each study: name of the main author and year of publication, study location/region, sample size, test methods for detecting syphilis and its prevalence, as well as the methodological quality of the studies. To assess the quality of each selected study, the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data, developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) was used. The extracted data were inserted into a table in Microsoft Excel (version 2010) and exported to Software R (version 3.5.1) for statistical analysis. The forest plot was used to illustrate the results of the meta-analysis. To estimate the pooled prevalence of syphilis, the random effects model was used with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and its degree was measured with I A total of 1,895 studies were retrieved from the databases: 1,049 from PubMed, 288 from Scopus, 217 from Science Direct, 146 from LILACS, 99 from Web of Science, 84 for Portal Capes and 12 from SciELO. After excluding duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 75 studies were selected for full-text reading. Of these, 24 cross-sectional studies including 221,884 pregnant women met the eligibility criteria. The study selection process is illustrated in  The studies were carried out between 2007 and 2020 and the population ranged from 185 to 54,813 pregnant women, as shown in  VDRL - venereal disease research laboratory; RT - rapid test, RPR=rapid plasma regain; FTA-Abs - fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, TPHA - treponema pallidum hema gglutination test, DBS - dried blood spot; ELISA - enzyme linked immunosorbent assay About the quality of studies, as shown in  Most studies (n=14) reported the factors associated with the occurrence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil, the most discussed among the studies were black and brown skin color, low level of education, and factors related to the partner like conflictual relationship, drug use and previous history of STIs by the partner ( Other factors mentioned were age, specially under 30 years old, previous history of STI or violence and early sexual intercourse. The publication bias was assessment through visual inspection of the funnel plot, which appears symmetrical, indicating low risk of bias. The Egger test was t = −0.40 (p = 0.69) ( Sensitivity analyzes were performed to assess the influence of study quality as well as population size on the meta-analysis. However, when studies with a score lower than 8 in the quality assessment or with a population of less than a thousand women were excluded, there was no reduction in heterogeneity (analyses available in the  This study presents the combined prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil between 2005 and 2023. Although similar publications already exist, this review specifically addresses Brazil and updates a previous publication about this relevant topic. According to the results obtained, syphilis during pregnancy presents itself as a public health problem, especially affecting socially less favored classes. The estimated pooled prevalence of syphilis in the present meta-analysis was 1.79% (95% CI: 1.24-2.57%) among pregnant women in Brazil. This prevalence was similar to results found in a previous primary study conducted in the five regions of the country with 23,894 pregnant women, which showed a prevalence of 1.02%. Corroborating this hypothesis, when compared to studies carried out in the African continent, this study demonstrates a low prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy in Brazil. In Ethiopia, a cross-sectional study including 210 pregnant women reported a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI: 0.5-3.5%) The two most comprehensive cross-sectional studies included in this review found similar prevalences (0.89% and 1.10%) with the estimate obtained in our meta-analysis (1%). Regarding the factors associated with the occurrence of syphilis in pregnant women, socioeconomic factors stand out. The results of this systematic review indicate that black and brown color skin, low education, factors related to the partner like conflictual relationship, drug use and previous history of STIs by the partner and factors related to pregnancy and prenatal care in addition to unfavorable living conditions, significantly influence the rates of syphilis infection during the gestation. A study carried out in Fortaleza – Ceará (CE) reported maternal characteristics similar to those found in this research, corroborating the influence of socioeconomic conditions in the determination of gestational syphilis. As described in the literature, two phenomena corroborate for women with low education and low income to lead the prevalence rates of syphilis in pregnancy, namely, the limited understanding about the importance of measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), The age group most affected by syphilis during pregnancy in brazilian women was between 20 and 29 years old. Similar findings were described in places like Macaé - Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Americana - São Paulo (SP), based on secondary data provided by the Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance. Late initiation of prenatal care is also a factor with a strong impact on the detection and treatment of syphilis. The Ministry of Health recommends that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis, at least, in the first prenatal consultation, at the beginning of the third trimester and during hospitalization for childbirth, since this diagnosis is basically serological. This study has limitations, such as the high heterogeneity between studies. Due to the great spatial and methodological variability of the studies, pooled estimates were also calculated for specific characteristics, like studies with population size > 1000 women and score > 8 in the JBI instrument (supplementary material). However, sensitivity analyzes were not able to explain the higher heterogeneity, but we carefully explored the available literature in search of factors that could explain such heterogeneous results. In addition, the selection of studies, data extraction and assessment of the quality of the included articles can be influenced by judgments on the part of the authors, and to mitigate this risk, such steps were performed by more than one researcher, independently. Future studies can be conducted for to investigate the particularities between regional subgroups and sociodemographic characteristics regarding the prevalence of syphilis in the pregnant population. There was a high prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy in Brasil, mainly associated with socioeconomic factors, like color skin and scolarship, factors related to the partner and low adherence to prenatal care.","['Syphilis', 'Pregnant women', 'Pregnancy complications', 'infectious', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Brazil']",2024-5-27,Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia,"""sti"""
11459845,"Cervical cancer screening service utilisation and related factors among women on antiretroviral therapy in public health facilities of Asella town, Ethiopia, cross-sectional study","Cervical cancer is the predominant form of cancer in Ethiopia, accounting for the majority of malignant cases. Women account for two-thirds of cancer-related deaths in the country. Cervical cancer screening (CCS) can help prevent disease development, but screening rates are unacceptably low. The greatest number of women were in the most vulnerable group, and the availability of wheal data on their use of CCSs was limited. This study aimed to evaluate the use of CCS and the factors that influence its use among HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities. This study used a cross-sectional study design. A total of 396 (97.5%) HIV-positive women participated in this study between March 10 and May 30, 2023. Participants enrolled in public health facilities in Asella town were selected through systematic random sampling, and data were collected through on-site interviews using a pretested, structured questionnaire. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science, Version 26. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determining factors. The findings from this study indicated that 30.3% of individuals used cervical cancer screening services. Those women who had knowledge about cervical cancer had a 2.54 times greater likelihood of receiving CCS than those who were not informed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = (2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42–4.56). Women with a history of sexually transmitted diseases were twice as likely to use CCS as those without such a history (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.13–3.73). Furthermore, women with a positive attitude towards CCS were found to be significant predictors of utilisation, showing a greater than threefold greater likelihood of using these services (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.78–5.81). The proportion of HIV-positive women who underwent cervical cancer screening (CCS) was significantly lower than the recommended guideline of 80%. To enhance the uptake of screening among women with HIV, healthcare professionals should focus on enhancing awareness about cervical cancer, improving attitudes towards CCS, and advancing knowledge about the disease. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-024-10003-0.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiological agent responsible for the development of cervical cancer (CC), a disease affecting reproductive organs [ Cervical cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer and the 2nd most common female cancer in women aged 15 to 44 years globally [ The primary causes of the high incidence of cervical cancer are early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, HIV infection, history of STIs, HPV infection, smoking, limited access to early detection resources, and inadequate HPV vaccination coverage [ In response to the growing incidence of cervical cancer, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging global collaborative efforts to eliminate the disease. Eradication entails decreasing the number of new cases to less than 4 per 100,000 women annually through regular screening [ In Ethiopia, however, there is limited utilization of HPV screening, and the barriers to this have not been fully examined, especially in our region. These insights are essential for enhancing healthcare professionals’ awareness and pinpointing the health facilities offering cervical cancer screening services. This study sought to evaluate the current use of HPV screening among HIV-positive women and determine the factors that may influence it. The study was conducted in Asella town, southeast Ethiopia. In the study area, 1 government referral hospital, 2 general hospitals, and 2 health centres provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) services. The study was carried out between April 10 and May 10, 2023. An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used. All HIV-positive women who were receiving ART were followed up in Asella town public health facilities. All HIV-positive women who attended ART follow-up clinics in Asella town public health facilities during the study period composed the study population. A total of 695 study participants were selected from public health facilities. All HIV-positive women aged 15 to 49 years were included in the study. HIV-positive women who were unable to be interviewed because of severe health problems such as mental problems, who were critically sick, or who had hearing defects at the time of data collection were excluded from the study. There are 3 public health institutions in Asella town. Currently, two of the institutions, Asella Referral Hospital and Asella Health Centre were the only public health facilities that provided services for ART and CCS. There were 3850 patients currently enrolled in an ART clinic at Asella Referral Hospital; 2399 (62.3%) of these patients were women, and 1763 (73.5%) of these patients were eligible for the study. Approximately 844 patients from the Asella Health Centre were enrolled in the ART-Clinic, of whom 551 (65.3%) were women and 426 (32%) were eligible for this study period. For the first objective, the sample size was determined using Epi info version 7.2.5. Accordingly, the sample size was calculated by considering the following assumptions: the proportion of CCS service utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive women attending adult ART clinics in public health facilities in Hawassa town, Ethiopia, 2019, was 40.1% [ The sample size was proportionally allocated to these health institutions based on the average of three months of ART client flow prior to the data collection. The total population for these health institutions (their average monthly ART flows were estimated to be 695) (630 for Asella Hospital and 65 for Asella Health Centre). Then, the calculated sample size was proportionally allocated to the size of the clients of the two health institutions by the rule of probability proportional to size sampling. Finally, the study participants were selected from each health institution using a systematic random sampling technique (i.e., Kth = N/sample size = > 695/406 ≈ 2, which means Kth = 2); thus, every 2nd mother was recruited as a study unit in each health facility until the total sample size for this study was obtained.

A  Ten items were used to measure knowledge of cervical cancer screening. First, we assign a response code of 1 for the right response and a code of 0 for the incorrect response. After that, we added all of the answers to the knowledge questions to determine a final score of 10. The mean was computed using the results of 10 knowledge assessment questions. The expected scores ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum. After calculating the overall score for each participant, we summed all the overall scores and divided the result by the total number of participants. Then, we classified poor knowledge as those whose mean knowledge score was below the obtained mean and good knowledge as those whose score was equal to or above the mean [ Eight questions were used to gauge attitudes toward cervical cancer screening using a Likert scale. Participants’ responses were used to determine the following scoring system: strongly agree, 5; agree, 4; neither agree nor disagree, 3; disagree, 2; and strongly disagree, 1. All of the recoded attitude responses were combined by adding each response to obtain an overall score of 8. This is the mean of the Likert scale dichotomous to disagree and agree, which is calculated by merging strongly agree and agree recorded as “1” and all other values (strongly disagree, disagree, and neutral) by decoding “0.” The expected scores ranged from 0 to 8, with 8 being the maximum. After determining the mean score, respondents were classified as having either a favourable or unfavourable attitude depending on whether they scored above or below the mean [ The questionnaires were prepared in the English language and translated to Afaan Oromo by a language expert to check consistency. The questionnaires were adapted after reviewing different relevant literature [ The questionnaire was translated from English to Afaan Oromo and back to English by a language expert to assure its consistency. The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the total sample size in the Huruta Health Centre, which is located 40 km away from the study area, and the data collection tool was modified in terms of sequence, grammar and how to conduct interviews. One day of training was given to the data collectors and supervisors regarding the aim of the study, the data collection tool and the procedures of the questionnaires. Supervision was provided by the Principal Investigator and Supervisor. All completed data collection forms were examined for completeness and consistency during the data collection period. Supervisors and principal investigators reviewed each questionnaire daily and checked for completeness, and further editions were made.

After normality was verified, the respondents’ mean age was 32.8 years, and the standard deviation (SD) was 8.68, with a range of 20 to 49 years. In terms of marital status, 261 respondents (65.9%) were married. Additionally, approximately 278 (70.2%) of the participants were urban dwellers. Of the study participants, 234 (64.1%) belonged to the Oromo ethnic group. Regarding their religion, 183 (46.2%) respondents were Orthodox, and 153 (38.36%) were Muslim. (Table  
 Sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive women in Asella town public health facilities in Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 The proportion of women with HIV who underwent CCS in Asella town was 120 (30.3%). The primary reason for not screening for CC among women was their perception of their health (157, 56.9%), followed by lack of knowledge (70, 25.4%). Approximately 340 (85.9%) women had a history of pregnancy. One hundred seventy-eight (52.4%) women were multipara, followed by 89 (26.2%) who were primiparous.

 Factors associated with cervical cancer screening utilization among HIV-positive mothers in Asella town public health facilities, Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 Note:  The objective of this study was to evaluate the utilization of cervical cancer screening services among women with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities in Asella town. Based on recent survey data, it was found that 30.3% of women living with HIV received cervical cancer screenings. This rate is considerably higher than the 7.8% in the Tigray Region [ Our research findings reveal that cervical cancer screening rates are suboptimal in countries with comparable ecological and economic circumstances. In South Africa, the screening rate for women stands at 65% [ In this study, mothers who were HIV positive and had completed at least secondary school were 2.39 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than mothers who had not received any formal education. Similar studies conducted in Ethiopia, specifically in the nation [ Women with HIV and a history of STIs were more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than were those without a history of STIs. Studies conducted at Adama Hospital and Medical College yielded similar findings [ In HIV-positive women, having a thorough understanding of cervical cancer increased the likelihood of using screening services by 2.56 times compared to those with limited knowledge. Previous studies in Tanzania [ The utilization of cervical cancer screening among HIV-positive women was found to be lower than recommended. Factors such as educational status, history of sexually transmitted diseases, knowledge of cervical cancer, and attitudes towards screening were significant predictors of whether women received screenings. Asella referral hospitals and Asella health centre should focus on increasing awareness and educating HIV-positive women on the importance of screening. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. Despite all these rates falling below the recommended levels of CCS utilisation in different public health services, implication to the improvements of ultimately in a short period of time are uncertain in our facility, in our country and even in Sub-Saharan Region. The Ministry of Health and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations should also launch educational campaigns using various mass media platforms to address negative attitudes towards screening and promote uptake among HIV-positive women. We were able to determine the most important diseases and population conditions from extensive reviews to the most recent WHO recommendations, which urge frequent cervical cancer assessments of high-risk groups every two years as important, especially for women who are HIV positive. However, our study used a cross-sectional study design that did not show a cause-and-effect relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

The model explores the influence of natural, meteorological and anthropogenic factors on flooding occurrences under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and assesses flood risks at Bulk Supply Points (BSPs). Flood susceptibility mapping was conducted for both current and future periods under various SSP scenarios. Results reveal that elevation, slope, soil type, distance from urban areas, and SPI are the most influential factors contributing to flooding susceptibility in the region. The current flood map, about 37% of the total area of GAR categorized under the moderate flood-susceptible zone category followed by about 30% categorized under the low flood-vulnerable zone. However, about 16% was categorized under the very high flood-vulnerable zone. The study projects increasing flood susceptibility under the SSP scenarios with intensification under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. For instance, the areas categorized as high and very high flood susceptibility zones are projected to expand to approximately 32% and 26% each by 2055 under SSP3. The study also assesses flood risks at Bulk Supply Points (BSPs), highlighting the escalating susceptibility of power assets to flooding under different scenarios. For instance, in the very high scenario, flooding is estimated to reach 640 h in 2045 and exceed 800 h in 2055—more than double the 2020 baseline. The analysis shows the bulk supply points face increasing flood susceptibility, with risks escalating most sharply under the severe climate change SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios. Over 75% of BSPs are expected to fall in the low- to medium-risk categories across SSPs while more than 50% of BSPs are within medium- to high-risk categories in all scenarios except SSP1, reflecting the impact of climate change. SSP3 and SSP5 stand out with over 60% of BSPs facing high or very high flooding risks by 2055. It indicates moderate resilience with proper adaptation but highlights potential disruptions in critical infrastructure, such as BSPs, during persistent flooding. The findings of the study are expected to inform Ghana’s contributions towards addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 11 and 13 in Ghana.","Over the years, various forms of natural and anthropogenically-induced disasters, such as earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and floods, amongst others, have occurred [ Sarkar and Mondal [ The UN regional Coordinator in Dakar revealed that the July 2007 flood event in West Africa was the most tragic flood event in the last 30 years. As a result of the flood event, more than 210,000 and 785,000 people were killed and displaced, respectively. Again, about 600,000 inhabitants were affected after torrential rains in 16 Wwest African countries where Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal were the most affected. Aside from this, Nigeria in 2012 recorded one of the most catastrophic flood events ever observed, which resulted in the displacement and death of 2.3 million and 363 people, respectively [ The existence of perennial urban flooding in Ghana dates back to 1930 [ Flooding has a significant impact on power systems. It can lead to long outage times and the destruction of power system equipment such as substations, transmission lines, and power plants [ Flooding is of particular concern for the bulk supply points (BSPs) that deliver electricity from generating plants to end users in the Greater Accra region. These facilities, operated by the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo), contain vital transformers, switching gear and control equipment. Flood damage to BSPs can disrupt the entire downstream supply chain, affecting hospitals, businesses, homes, and other critical services. In 2015, major flooding of a GRIDCo substation in Achimota left many parts of Accra without power for several days [ Therefore, mapping flood susceptibility to design management schemes can combat the destruction of BSPsin the future and be used to direct governments and policymakers to establish appropriate flood management strategies. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques now have the capacity to support a new understanding of the assessment of susceptibility with better justification [ Other studies have employed various robust methodologies to map flood susceptibility. For instance, previous studies [ Several studies have generally mapped flood susceptibility in the Greater Accra region. However, most of these studies were limited to only the Accra metropolitan area. For example, Dekongmen et al. [ Greater Accra spans approximately 3,245 km Study area map In the Greater Accra region, flooding is a recurring concern, particularly in low-lying areas and zones with poor drainage systems. Heavy rainfall during the peak seasons, compounded by the region's topography and land use, often leads to inundation and waterlogging. The lack of adequate infrastructure and urban planning exacerbates this issue, making some areas prone to flash floods and subsequent damage to property and livelihoods. Additionally, the encroachment on waterways and wetlands further contributes to the region's susceptibility to flooding incidents. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive flood mitigation strategies, improved drainage systems, and sustainable urban development practices to minimize the impact of flooding in Greater Accra. The detailed specifications of the datasets used in the study are presented in Table  Sources and type of data used Flood conditioning factors used for the study Elevation is a key factor affecting flooding, with lower elevations generally experiencing a higher risk of flooding [ Slope is a crucial factor in hydrology, with a direct relationship to surface runoff and a significant impact on flooding [ Curvature offers important insights into the terrain's geomorphological characteristics [ TWI and SPI are critical hydrological factors commonly used in flood studies. TWI (Topographic Wetness Index) maps the spatial distribution of moisture, influencing surface runoff patterns [ In this study, geology is regarded as a key conditioning factor due to its direct impact on the ground's water absorption capacity [ In susceptibility mapping, understanding the spatial distribution of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is crucial for identifying which land use types and activities are most affected by frequent flooding. Different LULC categories, such as croplands, bare lands, and built-up areas, particularly in low-lying regions, can significantly influence flood occurrence and severity. For instance, areas with extensive croplands may experience increased runoff due to soil disruption, while bare lands offer minimal absorption and can lead to heightened surface runoff. Built-up areas, especially in flood-prone zones, often have impervious surfaces that exacerbate flooding by preventing natural water absorption [ Proximity to natural drainage is a critical conditioning factor due to its substantial impact on flooding. Areas located near natural drainage systems, such as streams and rivers, are more prone to flooding because these water bodies can quickly convey excess water during heavy rainfall. The distance from streams is an important aspect to consider; regions closer to streams are at a higher risk of flooding compared to those further away. This is because the closer proximity allows for less time for water to dissipate, leading to quicker accumulation and higher flood risks in these areas. Drainage density, which measures the extent of stream networks within the study area, also plays a crucial role in flood events. A higher drainage density, with numerous and densely packed streams, can exacerbate flooding by increasing the volume and speed of surface runoff. Areas with a high drainage density often experience more frequent and severe floods due to the efficient and rapid channeling of water from rainfall into streams and rivers. Figure  The distance from urban areas and roads is a vital factor in assessing flood susceptibility in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Urbanization significantly alters the region's hydrological dynamics, influencing its susceptibility to flooding. Analyzing how proximity to urban centers and transportation networks affects flood risk is essential for effective flood risk management and mitigation. Urbanization tends to increase flood risks through multiple mechanisms. The expansion of built-up areas does not only result in more impervious surfaces, but also lead to issues such as improper solid waste disposal into drainage systems, which can clog and impair their functionality, construction activities, especially in or near waterways, can further disrupt natural water flow and exacerbate flooding as well as informal activities in unplanned urban areas—such as unauthorized encroachments, and illegal dumping can severely affect drainage systems and water flow patterns. These activities can redirect or concentrate runoff towards areas not adequately prepared for high volumes of water, increasing the likelihood of severe flooding. Figure  In evaluating flood susceptibility, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is crucial for assessing land cover and land use changes. NDVI values range from − 1 to 1, with higher values reflecting healthier and denser vegetation (Fig.  The aspect, or the direction a slope faces, is a key factor in flood susceptibility within the region of Ghana (Fig.  For flood susceptibility mapping, it is imperative to consider historical flood occurrence data that is scientifically justified to forecast future floods [ Greater Accra Flood inventory map The evaluation of flood susceptibility is relevant to discover the conditioning factors of floods. The association between the occurrence of flooding and the related conditioning factors can be detected based on historical flooding events and their causative factors. The study utilizes the FR model in generating the flood susceptibility maps for Greater Accra under the SSP scenarios. The FR model is a bivariate statistical analysis technique that critically analyzes the contribution of each class of each flood conditioning factor on future flooding [ An FR value greater than 1 indicates significant parameters that strongly contribute to flooding. Conversely, an FR value less than 1 signifies an inverse relationship between flood occurrence and the conditioning factors [ After the estimation of the FR for every class, all values for each conditioning factor are summed for generating the final flood susceptibility map. The formula for the final flood susceptibility index (FSI) (see Eq.  The FR approach has been successfully applied for flood susceptibility mapping globally [ However, prediction rate is calculated as The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [ Figure  Methodological flowchart for flood susceptibility mapping Historical precipitation data from 1991 to 2020 was obtained from the World Climate Guide to determine average monthly rainfall days in Accra [ Future rainfall intensification under each SSP scenario was quantified using the prediction rates of influential flood conditioning factors (precipitation, land cover, and distance from urban areas) from the frequency ratio flood model results. The relative increase in these factors compared to 2020 baseline levels was used to scale the typical 8-h flooding duration each month and estimate future flood duration hours through to 2055. The locations of 45 electricity bulk supply points (BSPs) in Greater Accra were mapped in GIS software using data obtained from GRIDCo and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), as presented in Appendix 3. The capacity and average annual availability of each BSP facility were compiled based on information from the electricity distribution companies. Availability factors of 0.85 accounting for maintenance downtime were applied to estimate each BSP's annual electricity supply potential in MWh based on its capacity in MW. We define power denial in this context to mean power not available to consumers due to the shutdown of a flooded BSP. Flood susceptibility maps were used to identify BSP susceptibility to flood which is crucial for a comprehensive risk assessment. While flood depth and duration are primary factors in determining potential inundation, the use of flood susceptibility maps provided additional critical insights by incorporating multiple flood conditioning factors such as elevation, land cover, and drainage density. This multidimensional approach enhanced the predictive accuracy of flood risks, which informs strategic planning for infrastructure resilience under different climate scenarios. The flood duration estimated each month per SSP scenario were assumed to represent BSP outage times during an extreme flooding event to quantify power denial in Eq. ( Table  Features and FR results of flood factors For distance from stream, areas with distance between 0.0024 and 0.0053 m to stream recorded an FR value of 1.34. This signifies that as the distance decreases from a stream, the FR value increases leading to a high probability of flooding in these areas. Likewise, FR values tend to increase as distance from urban areas decreases. For instance, areas with distance between 1–72.56 and 72.56–141.87 m from urban recorded 1.08 and 1.33 FR values, respectively, showing a high probability of flooding in these areas (Table  From Table  Concerning drainage density, areas with low drainage density have higher chances of flooding. For instance, areas with lower drainage density (< 27) in Greater Accra observed about 38% of historical flooding as FR values for subclasses between 0.001–13.3 and 13.3–26.99 were all above one (see Table  The TWI and elevation are also important flood conditioning factors. Flood probability tends to increase where TWI increases. For instance, all the subclasses (except the first subclass) had FR values greater than one (see Table  For preparing the flood-vulnerable maps, layers were created for all—15 flood conditioning factors and prediction rates estimated respectively. The prediction rate, which curbs issues of drawback and considers the mutual interrelationship among independent factors was estimated. The prediction rate reveals the sensitivity of individual flood conditioning factors with the training data. All the flood conditioning factors were combined for the baseline and future periods to generate flood susceptibility maps for the baseline period and under the SSP scenarios. For preparing the flood-vulnerable map for the baseline period, the results were categorized into 5 subclasses ranging from very low to very high. Figure  Flood susceptibility map of Greater Accra region for the year 2020 Prediction rate of flood conditioning factors used in the FR model (left) and percentage of flood susceptibility zones (right) ROC curve of the FR model Figure  Flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios in 2055 relative to the baseline Percentage of flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios Percentage change in flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios relative to the baseline scenario Flood susceptibility projections under the SSP2 scenario reveals similar trends as in SSP1, especially from 2020 to 2035 (see Fig.  The flood susceptibility projections in the SSP3 scenario resembled those of the SSP2 scenario, showcasing a prevalence of moderate flood susceptibility from 2040 to 2045. Nevertheless, under the SSP3, there's an anticipated rise in the extent of high and very high flood susceptibility zones compared to the SSP2. Specifically, the areas categorized as high and very high flood susceptibility zones are projected to expand to approximately 31.4% and 26% respectively by 2050, compared to the respective percentages of 29.4% and 24.3% under SSP2, and are expected to maintain similar increments by 2055 (Fig.  Elevation, slope, proximity to urban areas, soil type/geology, and SPI are anticipated to serve as the primary influential factors driving flooding occurrences within the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios, as outlined in Appendix 1. However, the upward movement of distance from urban in the prediction rate, together with other drivers, shifted the dominant flood susceptibility index from moderate to high (see Appendix 1). This is evident in the 2055 of SSP2 and SSP3 where distance from urban became the second most significant flood conditioning factor (see Appendix 1). For SSP5, flood susceptibility projections reveal a similar trend as SSP1 across all the years under study (see Fig.  Figure  Flooding duration for different intensity scenarios The baseline flood susceptibility map in Fig.  2020 flood susceptibility map of the BSPs BSP flood susceptibilities and power denied across SSP scenarios The analysis shows the bulk supply points face increasing flood susceptibility, with risks escalating most sharply under the severe climate change SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios. In the 2025–2035 period, over 75% of BSPs fall in the low- to medium-risk categories across SSPs. However, by 2055, more than 50% of BSPs are within medium- to high-risk categories in all scenarios except SSP1, reflecting the impact of climate change. SSP3 and SSP5 stand out with over 60% of BSPs facing high or very high flooding risks by 2055. Coastal and low-lying BSPs like Tema Siemens, Dawhenya, and Awoshie are most vulnerable, with thousands of megawatt-hours denied each year. Persistent failures at these facilities would cripple industrial zones and commercial areas. The results highlight the urgent need for flood resilience adaptation, as power assets currently lack protection. Without major infrastructure improvements, Accra faces severe electricity service disruptions from BSP failures due to flooding, jeopardizing critical facilities and economic functions. Early action under SSP1 to limit emissions and upgrade at-risk BSPs could avoid the worst impacts. However, delayed action under SSP3 and SSP5 could leave Accra's power system highly susceptible to devastating floods. Proactive resilience investments will be essential to ensure BSP operability and energy security for Greater Accra's growing population. The flood risk analysis shows power denied due to outages escalating over time, but with distinct trends across scenarios as shown in Fig.  Electricity denied forecast (left) and percentage of electricity denied from total BSP supply (right) The results of the study show high positive correlation between the flood conditioning factors and the occurrence of flooding in the Greater Accra region as revealed by the FR values. Elevation, distance from urban, slope, soil, SPI and precipitation were the first five most sensitive parameters that is expected to influence flooding in the Greater Accra region, with SPI and precipitation interchanging positions under the SSP scenarios. Several studies have attributed flooding in Greater Accra to non-meteorological factors [ Again, distance from urban areas is the second-most sensitive flood conditioning factor in the Greater Accra region, especially in the future under the SSP scenarios. The SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios are expected to be the worst-case scenarios where high flood susceptibility zones are expected to generally dominate. This may be attributed to the population projections under the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. For instance, population is expected to hit 9 and 12.6 billion by the end of the twenty-first century [ The results show Accra's power system should increase adaptation measures to manage future supply impacts due to flooding as persistent flooding of these facilities would paralyze southern Accra's power supply chain. Key industrial and commercial areas could face prolonged blackouts during flood events, and hospitals, water services, and other critical infrastructure would be jeopardized. To enhance resilience, flood defenses should be prioritized at the most vulnerable BSPs, like Achimota, Weija, Ridge, Dawhenya, Tema, Awoshie, Afienya, Spintex, Adabraka, Avenor, Tseaddo, Kokomlemle, and and Graphic Road substations. Elevating or relocating flood-prone components like transformers could enable them to function during lower-level flooding events [ This study analyzed current and future flood risks and their impacts on electricity bulk supply points in Greater Accra, Ghana under different climate change (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios. The study used 16 flood conditioning factors in simulating current and future flood conditions under the SSP scenarios using the Frequency Ratio (FR) model. The performance of the model was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, displaying high accuracy (an Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.83) for flood susceptibility mapping in Greater Accra. Analysis reveals elevation, distance from urban areas, slope, soil type, SPI, and precipitation as the primary influential parameters increasing flood susceptibility in the region. Notably, elevation emerges as a critical factor, especially for areas near the coast between 21 and 47.25 m above sea level. Moreover, the distance from urban areas, particularly under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios, emerges as another significant factor affecting flooding due to population growth and subsequent urbanization. Moreover, the study identified vulnerable electricity infrastructure and projected potential impacts on power supply for the region under the SSP scenarios. The results illustrate the urgent need to adapt Accra's power system infrastructure to increasing flood hazards driven by climate change. Electricity disruption due to flooding is projected to grow, leaving coastal and low-lying bulk supply points at high risk. Persistent flooding of these facilities would cripple Accra's electricity supply chain, jeopardizing key services and economic functions. To enhance resilience, the study recommends prioritizing upgrades like flood barriers, elevated equipment, and infrastructure hardening at the highest-risk bulk supply points. Restricting new development in floodplains is also critical to limit exposure. Collaborative adaptation efforts between utilities, government agencies, and communities will be essential to develop tailored resilience strategies. Model coupling with long-term energy system optimization models will also reveal optimal energy planning pathways to mitigate flooding impacts in the future, as part of further studies.","['Flood modeling', 'SSPs', 'Buly supply points', 'Flood risk', 'Sustainable development', 'Frequency ratio', 'Flood susceptibility']",2024-10-7,Discover Water,"""sti"""
11458460,Time-course effects of exercise intervention on executive function in adolescents with obesity,"This study was to investigate the developmental characteristics of executive function (EF) in obese adolescents and the time-course effects of a 14-week exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training on EF in this population. The experimental group of 28 obese junior high school students participated in the exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training, while the control group of 24 healthy weight junior high school students engaged in the regular recess exercise. EF, including inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, was assessed 1 week prior to the exercise intervention and at 12 and 14 weeks post-intervention. Changes in EF sub-functions in both groups at different time points during the exercise intervention were analyzed. The findings revealed that obese junior high school students exhibited lower levels of inhibition ( Obese adolescents had impaired EF, as evidenced by low levels of the inhibition and cognitive flexibility compared to healthy weight adolescents. The exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training had a positive effect on EF of obese adolescents. The time-course effects of the intervention on improvements in inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility varied with intervention duration in obese adolescents, with significant changes in inhibition and cognitive flexibility observed at 12 weeks and significant changes in working memory at 14 weeks.","Globally, there is a persistent public health concern regarding the high prevalence of overweight and obesity ( One crucial aspect of cognitive function is executive function (EF), which encompasses higher-level cognitive processes that regulate and manage various fundamental cognitive functions during the execution of complex cognitive tasks. EF comprises three sub-functions: inhibition, working memory and cognitive flexibility ( Moreover, prior research has indicated that exercise intervention can enhance physical fitness, motor proficiency, and academic achievement in adolescents with and without disabilities ( A hybrid experimental design involving 2 groups (experimental group, control group) × 3 time points (pretest, 12 weeks, 14 weeks) was implemented in this study ( The experimental group consisted of obese junior high school students who performed an exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training. The control group consisted of junior high school students of healthy weight who performed regular recess exercises. The exercise intervention was administered by professional physical education instructors. Several prior research studies have demonstrated that a 12-week exercise intervention can enhance EF to different extents ( The obese junior high school students included in this study were selected based on specific criteria. These criteria were: (1) Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI = weight (kg)/height (m) In this study, cluster sampling methodology was employed to select participants. Specifically, 28 obese junior high school students were identified from a pool of 170 students, resulting in a detection rate of 16.5%. Additionally, 24 junior high school students with healthy BMI and BFR were chosen randomly to serve as the control group. The group of the experiment was double-blind, ensuring that both the subjects and the individuals administering the exercise intervention were unaware of the group assignments. The study was carried out following the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, received approval from the Ethics Committee, adhered to the Standards of Ethics in Sport and Exercise Science Research, and was undertaken in partnership with the Laboratory School. The study protocol was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry at  The EF was assessed using the E-prime 2.0 system on a computer ( In the Flanker task, participants were presented with two types of conditions: consistent conditions, where all letters on the screen are the same (e.g., “FFFFF”), and inconsistent conditions, where the middle letter was different from the others (e.g., “FFLFF”), as shown in  Flanker task. In the 1-back task, participants were exposed to a series of 26 English letters displayed on a screen. Each letter was shown for a duration of 2,000 ms, with a 3,000 ms interval between consecutive letters. The task required subjects to determine if the current letter matched the preceding one and respond accordingly using a designated key, as illustrated in  1-back task. In the More-odd shifting task, participants were exposed to numerical stimuli, with one number displayed on each screen. Each number was shown for 2,000 ms, with a 3,000 ms interval between different digits. The test comprised three distinct stages. The initial stage involved the presentation of black numbers to assess the relationship between the number and the magnitude of 5. Subsequently, green numbers were displayed in the second stage to evaluate the parity of the numbers (odd or even). In the final stage, a mix of green and black numbers were randomly presented, with participants required to judge magnitude when black numbers appeared and parity when green numbers were shown, as illustrated in  More-odd shifting task. Exercise in the experimental and control groups took place at the same time. The experimental group participated in a 40-min exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training, while the control group participated in a 40-min regular recess exercises. Both groups engaged in exercise activities during the 50-min morning school recess period. The exercise intervention was centrally administered from September to December. The multi-path theory, as posited by our research team in the previous period, suggested that the beneficial impact of exercise intervention on EF development can be realized through three pathways ( Based on the above, in the development of an exercise intervention for obese junior high school students, in terms of action characteristics, the difficulty of the actions was gradually increased according to the subjects’ mastery of each motor skill, from single actions to combined actions, from simple to complex actions, and from familiar to unfamiliar actions. In terms of exercise intensity, a subset of participants wore Polar heart rate monitors during each exercise intervention, with average heart rates recorded at specific intervals to ensure moderate intensity levels were maintained. Furthermore, exercise scenarios were tailored to include cooperative, multi-memory point, multi-tasking, and problematic challenges aligned with participants’ preferences, gradually escalating cognitive demands to sustain engagement and enhance EF. The 14-week exercise intervention program consisted of the following components: (1) Exercise frequency: participants engaged in physical activity 4 times per week. (2) Exercise intensity: participants exercised at a moderate intensity, calculated as (220 minus age) multiplied by 60–69%. (3) Duration of each exercise session: 40 min per session, comprising 5 min of warm-up, 20 min of aerobic exercise, 10 min of resistance training, and 5 min of relaxation exercises. (4) Type of exercise: the intervention included a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training, with aerobic exercise being the primary focus and resistance training serving as a supplementary component. Aerobic activities included pattern running, aerobic games, and rope ladder training, while resistance training focused on exercises utilizing one’s own body weight to target strength development in the upper limbs, lower limbs, and core muscles. SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States) was used to process and analyze the data, the Independent-samples T test was used to developmentally characterize the EF, BMI and BFR of obese and healthy weight junior high school students, and the repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze the separate and interactive effects of two factors of group and time, with statistical analysis significant at  In order to accurately control the exercise intensity, 4 obese junior high school students were randomly selected in this study to wear Polar meter to monitor heart rate. Specific methods: 2 male and 2 female students were randomly selected, and 5 heart rate measurements were taken during each exercise intervention, namely: during the quiet time before the intervention, the 10th minute, the 20th minute, the 30th minute, and the 40th minute, and the exercise intensity was monitored according to the average heart rate. As shown in  The monitoring figure of the individual average heart rate per activity of 4 obese junior high school students in the experimental group. The monitoring figure of the overall average heart rate per activity of 4 obese junior high school students in the experimental group.

The 14 weeks BFR of obese junior high school students in the experimental group was significantly different from the pretest [ There was a significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in BFR at pretest [ This study supported the hypothesis that obese adolescents exhibit impaired EF compared to their healthy weight peers, particularly in inhibition and cognitive flexibility. These findings aligned with previous research demonstrating similar findings in obese adolescents.  The physiological mechanisms behind the poor development of EF in obese junior high school students may be that obese people have a high fat content, which leads to a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow and speed, insufficient blood supply to the brain, and a decrease in blood oxygen saturation, which affects their brain metabolic processes ( The implications of our findings were profound, indicating that the compromised EF in obese adolescents could have broader consequences for their overall health and well-being. Given the pivotal role of EF in academic achievement and social adaptation, addressing this issue was not only crucial for the students’ immediate cognitive development but also for their long-term success and mental health. This study thus called for the development and implementation of targeted interventions aimed at enhancing EF in obese adolescents. This study supported the hypothesis that exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise with resistance training can significantly enhances EF in obese adolescents. These findings aligned with previous research indicating the cognitive benefits of both aerobic and resistance training for obese adolescents ( Beyond the three key pathways, the physiological mechanisms underlying our exercise intervention’ s efficacy in improving EF warrant attention. Long-term aerobic exercise combined with resistance training intervention successfully reduced fat content, enhanced blood circulation, and improved blood oxygen saturation in obese junior high school students. These physiological changes activated brain regions and functional connectivity associated with EF, as well as enhanced hippocampal insulin signaling and neuroplasticity ( Utilizing a multi-time-point measurement design, our study uniquely explored the time-course effects of the exercise intervention on the three sub-functions of EF: inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Our results indicated that different intervention cycles had selective positive effects on these sub-functions. Notably, inhibition and cognitive flexibility significantly improved at 12 weeks, while working memory significantly improved at 14 weeks. These findings build upon  Throughout the exercise intervention, participants engaged in continuous inhibition of dominant responses and conscious muscle control during resistance training, which likely contributed to the significant improvements in inhibition. Cognitive flexibility was enhanced through the need for constant movement transitions in response to changing exercise commands and rules. Working memory improvement was attributed to the participants’ requirement to memorize movements and game rules, and responded quickly in dynamic situations. Our focus on improving inhibition and cognitive flexibility, areas typically weaker in obese students compared to their healthy weight peers, may explained the earlier observed changes in these sub-functions. This targeted approach to exercise intervention design represents a novel strategy for optimizing EF development in obese adolescents. This study’s novel contribution lied in the specific focus on the time-course effects of the exercise intervention. This provided valuable insights into the optimal timing and duration of exercise interventions for EF development in obese adolescents. Additionally, the combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training, along with the multifaceted approach incorporating action complexity and diverse exercise scenarios, offered a unique perspective on the potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvements. In addition, the health implications of this study were significant. Improved EF can enhance academic performance, social interactions, and overall cognitive functioning, ultimately improving the quality of life for obese adolescents. This study provided evidence supporting the potential of exercise as a non-pharmacological intervention for improving cognitive function and overall health in obese adolescents. Despite its strengths, this study had limitations. The relatively shorted duration of the intervention and limited number of time points for EF measurements warrant further research exploring the long-term effects of exercise on the development of EF in obese adolescents as well as the late effects. Additionally, increasing the sample size and incorporating brain imaging techniques could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the observed improvements. Future research could also explored the impact of exercise on other cognitive functions, such as attention and memory, in obese adolescents. Additionally, investigating the effectiveness of targeted exercise interventions for different sports could provide valuable insights into the optimal exercise prescription for improving EF in obese adolescents. Obese adolescents had impaired EF, as evidenced by low levels of the inhibition and cognitive flexibility compared to healthy weight adolescents. The exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise and resistance training had a positive effect on EF of obese adolescents. The time-course effects of the intervention on improvements in inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility varied with intervention duration in obese adolescents, with significant changes in inhibition and cognitive flexibility observed at 12 weeks and significant changes in working memory at 14 weeks.","['obese adolescents', 'executive functions', 'exercise', 'inhibition', 'working memory', 'cognitive flexibility']",2024-9-24,Frontiers in Psychology,"""sti"""
11457904,Self-reported sexually transmitted infections and associated risk factors among female university students,"The spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an ongoing public health challenge, and awareness of risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive interventions. This study aimed to assess self-reported STI occurrences and identify risk factors and sexual behaviors associated with STIs among female university students. This is a cross-sectional, online questionnaire study, including 384 female university students seeking contraceptive counseling at a gynecology clinic in Uppsala, Sweden, and reporting having had sex. Associated risk factors and behaviors were assessed by comparing those who reported STIs and those who did not. The mean age of participants was 22.8 years. Seventy-eight (20%) had contracted at least one STI, with seven (9%) experiencing multiple infections. Seventy-three (94%) reported first-date sexual activity without a condom among STI experienced. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most common STI pathogen (68% of all infections), followed by Herpes simplex virus (18%) and Mycoplasma genitalium (13%). Behavioral factors associated with self-reported STIs were first-date sexual activity without a condom, not using condom at first intercourse, younger age at first intercourse, a higher number of sexual partners overall and in the last 12 months, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regretting sexual activity after substance use ( Condom use was low among the respondents, and STIs were common regardless of the high level of education in this group. Contraceptive counseling needs to highlight the importance of condom use in addition to contraceptive efficacy. It is also essential to consider the specific risk factors and behaviors prevalent among young adults to reduce the spread of STIs.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a common problem worldwide and present various challenges regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prevention in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Most STIs are not life-threatening, but they can still lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and fetal and neonatal morbidity ( University students can be considered especially vulnerable to contracting an STI, as partying, including binge drinking and recreational drug use, is a common and normalized behavior in campus culture ( Studies about sexual behavior and the use of contraceptives among female university students in Uppsala have been conducted regularly since 1989 ( Uppsala is a Swedish university city with about 50,000 students. Swedish-speaking women who visited an outpatient gynecology clinic for contraceptive counseling were asked to participate. Data collection took place between February and June 2023. Previously, only university students could visit this clinic, which was designated as the student healthcare clinic. From 2014 onward, it became open to all women. When attending the clinic, women were invited to participate and received information about the study along with a QR link to the survey. The survey was conducted via REDCap ( No ethical permission was needed since the study participants were anonymous, and no sensitive personal information could be linked to any individual (advisory opinion, Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 219-04587). Since this was a follow-up study, the questionnaire was mostly identical to those used in previous studies ( Statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 29.0.2.0) and R (version 4.2.3). Continuous and discrete variables were analyzed using T-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U-test for skewed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test when there were too few observations for Pearson’s chi-square test. Proportions of STIs are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Clopper-Pearsons exact CIs. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and testing multiple characteristics, we set the level of statistical significance at 0.003 in accordance with the Bonferroni correction method (0.05/20 = 0.0025 ≈ 0.003). In total, 599 persons answered the questionnaire. As this study focuses on university students, those who stated that they worked, went to upper secondary school, or did not answer the question about occupation were excluded from further analyses. In addition, we only included participants reporting having had sex. Thus, 384 women studying at the university remained, and the background characteristics of these are presented in  Background characteristics of study participants ( Out of the 384 study participants, 78 (20%, 95% CI 16.4 – 24.7%) had experienced at least one STI, and seven (9%, 95% CI 3.7 – 17.6%) of them reported a history of more than one STI. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most commonly occurring STI; see  Self-reported STI pathogens among female university students ( The percentage of STI pathogens adds up to 106.3% because seven females reported more than one pathogen Characteristics and sexual behavior related to STI status among female university students. Among those who reported having had anal sex ( Comparison of those who have had an STI with those who have not T-test, Pearson’s chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test Of the respondents, 20% had experienced an STI, and 9% of these had experienced multiple STIs. Both of these estimates were nominally lower than in the previous survey from 2014, when 26% reported one STI and 17% of these reported multiple STIs ( It is possible that the tendency toward a reduction in STI occurrence can be partly explained by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sweden, the Public Health Agency issued recommendations such as limiting close contacts and keeping a distance from others to limit the spread of the virus ( A significant difference in the number of sexual partners was observed between women with and without experience of an STI, with more sexual partners in the STI group, in line with previous studies ( Dating app usage and meeting sexual partners online have been associated with sexual risk behavior ( Among those who reported experiencing an STI, it was more than twice as common to report having ‘regretted sexual activity after substance use’ compared to those without STI experience. Finally, considering the risk of contracting an STI, it is worrying that more than half of all students and almost all the students in the STI group have experienced first-date sexual activity without a condom. As recruitment took place at a gynecology clinic, our study does not capture those using only condom and hence not needing an appointment to obtain a prescription. This might affect the low rate of condom use. However, condom use is always recommended with new partners despite the use of other contraceptives. It cannot be excluded that the low numbers are also affected by impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption, as one-night stands often occur after a night out. However, non-use of condom was not statistically significantly associated with STIs in all situations. This suggests that other risk behaviors besides sex without a condom are more important for STI risk, as one can behave responsibly, for example, by getting tested before having sex with a new partner and therefore not using a condom. With its cross-sectional design, this study only provides information on associations between known variables. Nonetheless, it is a good-sized sample from a clearly defined population and offers valuable insights into factors associated with STIs among university students. We also set a conservative significance level, safeguarding against false positives and overinterpretation of the results. Additionally, the high internal response rate further strengthens the study. All recruited participants attended the same gynecological clinic, which may indicate a certain sociodemographic group and cause selection bias. On the other hand, the clinic’s central location and popularity among students facilitated effective recruitment. Condom-only users rarely visit a clinic for contraceptive counseling, which may also contribute to selection bias. Participation in the study was anonymous, which we considered important to minimize the risk of social desirability bias, as most of the questions were on sensitive topics. A potential downside of anonymity is that we could not examine the representativeness of the sample, and there is a risk of non-response bias if those who declined participation represent a specific group. Furthermore, all the data collected were self-reported retrospectively, making recall bias likely to some extent since a person’s ability to accurately recall past events deteriorates with time. The reliability of self-reported diagnoses depends on many factors, including the type of condition, question design, and participant understanding. With self-reported diagnoses, it is impossible to know if the person truly had the disease and had it verified by healthcare professionals or merely self-diagnosed. Particularly in the case of STIs, which carry stigma, accurate reporting may be further compromised. Altogether, this might contribute to an underestimated STI occurrence. This study’s findings contribute to the existing literature on STIs and sexual risk behaviors, which is crucial for designing preventive measures and promoting sexual health among young adults. Despite efforts to prevent STIs, poor condom use remains a persistent problem, especially among dating app users and those under the influence of alcohol. While this study does not delve into the reasons behind the lack of condom use, further research in this area is essential to identify specific barriers and develop targeted interventions. Future studies should continue to monitor STI occurrence beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as the digital age and widespread use of dating apps may change people’s sexual habits and behaviors. The identified risk factors and behaviors for contracting an STI included younger age at first intercourse, a greater number of sexual partners, not using condom at first intercourse, first-date sexual activity without a condom, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regret of sexual activity after substance use. Despite the high level of education in this group, there was a worrying occurrence of STIs and a lack of condom use, especially under the influence of alcohol. These risk factors and behaviors should be considered when planning prevention efforts in this demographic group, and continuous promotion of condom use should be prioritized, especially in a risk context.","['Sexually transmitted diseases', 'sexual behavior', 'unsafe sex', 'sexual health', 'young adult']",2024-9-30,Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences,"""sti"""

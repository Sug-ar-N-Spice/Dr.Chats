11470662,"Examining concordance of sexual-related factors and PrEP eligibility with HIV risk perception among adolescent girls and young women: cross-sectional insights from DREAMS sites in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia","HIV risk perception is an important cognition for prevention, theoretically engendering service-seeking and risk-reduction behaviors, but its composition remains poorly understood. We examined country-specific correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk among sexually active adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, aged 15–24 years) without HIV in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. We also explored overlaps between self-appraised HIV exposure risk and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility to identify engagement opportunities. We analyzed cross-sectional data (2016/2017) to estimate sexual-related correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk (likely vs. not, temporally framed as “ever”) using log-Poisson models with robust standard errors. For sexual-related factors with an unadjusted  Few AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya [ AGYW's HIV risk perceptions were mostly influenced by factors beyond their locus of control. Conditional PrEP eligibility criteria may inhibit AGYW’s access and uptake in some settings: countries should consider decoupling these factors to minimize barriers. Intersections between autonomy, behaviors, and perceptions among AGYW in gender-inequitable settings warrants further investigation. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-024-20276-4.","The United Nations has committed to ending HIV/AIDS by 2030; to increase the likelihood of achieving this goal, interim 2025 targets were set at ≤ 370,000 annual global seroconversions [ The expanding HIV prevention toolkit provides AGYW with new options to reduce their HIV risk. In 2015, once-daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) became the first prevention method AGYW could use without partner cooperation, but initiation, adherence, and continuation remains low due to pill burden, side effect concerns, and stigma [ Despite their heightened risk for HIV acquisition, AGYW do not reliably use HIV prevention services and methods [ Improving AGYW’s HIV prevention outcomes necessitates understanding of the behaviors, circumstances, and experiences that influence how they perceive their risk of HIV acquisition. However, the underpinnings of AGYW’s HIV risk perception are rarely examined, highlighting its formulation is poorly understood. Illuminating these factors could inform activities and interventions to improve AGYW’s access, initiation, and effective use of HIV prevention services and methods, including PrEP [ This secondary analysis used cross-sectional data collected from AGYW residing in DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe) study sites in urban/peri-urban Kenya (2016–2017), rural Malawi (2017), and urban Zambia (2016–2017) during DREAMS’ pre-intervention phase. Briefly, DREAMS was a multi-component and -sectoral partnership to reduce AGYW’s HIV risk by implementing a suite of interventions targeting AGYW, families, partners, and communities [ To focus on HIV prevention, the samples included AGYW who self-reported being HIV negative and having sex in the last 12 months (sexually active). In Zambia, the sample comprised those currently having sex at the time of the interview due to questionnaire skip logic. Supplemental Material 1 presents the definitions for all study measures. We measured HIV risk perception using self-appraised likelihood of HIV exposure, ""how likely it is that you have been exposed to HIV?"", a question asked after all HIV-related risk modules, facilitating a retrospective assessment. We operationalized response categories as Likely (very likely, somewhat likely) vs. Unlikely (unlikely, not at all), excluding participants with missing or “don’t know” responses [ To identify variables for multivariable control, we explored sociodemographic factors, encompassing age group (adolescent girls, aged 15–19 years [AG] vs. young women, aged 20–24 years [YW]); ever-pregnant, orphanhood, out-of-school, employment, marital, and socio-economic status (SES); hunger; location; and DREAMS enrollee status. We assessed anxiety/depression symptoms and comprehensive HIV knowledge because they can vary risk perception [ First, we examined HIV-associated behaviors, including inconsistent condom use, STI symptoms, age-disparate and inter-generational sex, transactional sex, multiple sexual partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use. Next, we assessed relationship characteristics: partner(s)’ 1) community residence, 2) other partners, 3) HIV status, and 4) likely HIV exposure. Finally, we investigated respondents' survivorship of physical and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner sexual violence. PrEP eligibility was measured using criteria in each country’s national guidelines. Below, we outline the criteria for each country, followed by analytic definitions in parentheses. Kenya’s criteria included multiple partners (multiple partners), condomless sex (inconsistent condom use), partners’ unknown HIV status (does not know partner[s] HIV status), any partners at risk of HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), STI diagnosis (STI symptoms in last 6 months), received money/material support for sex (transactional sex), survived forced sex or physical assault (survived non-partner sexual violence or physical or sexual IPV), and history of sex while under the influence of drugs/alcohol (alcohol use) [ For Malawi, eligibility criteria comprised having an STI in the last 6 months (STI symptoms in last 6 months), giving/receiving monetary incentives for sex (transactional sex), and having an age-disparate partner and ever being pregnant (positive indications for both ever-pregnant and age-disparate sex, as defined by national guidelines) [ In Zambia, criteria encompassed sex with multiple partners without condoms (positive indications for both multiple partners and inconsistent condom use, as defined by national guidelines), partner has HIV/at substantial risk of acquiring HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), history of STIs (STI symptoms in last 6 months), and prior post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use (ever used PEP) [ We could not include sero-different partnership dynamics (Kenya, Malawi, Zambia), sharing injection materials (Kenya, Zambia), or PEP use (Kenya) due to questionnaire limitations. We operationalized PrEP eligibility as a binary measure (≥ 1 criteria versus None). For Malawi and Zambia, we also explored eligibility by decoupling their conditional criteria (e.g., Malawi: age-disparate sex and ever-pregnant, Zambia: multiple partners and inconsistent condom use). We examined country-specific correlates of likely HIV exposure, the dependent variable, using prevalence ratios (log-Poisson models, robust standard errors) generated with R (v.4.4.0) [ We descriptively explored intersections between HIV risk, PrEP eligibility, and risk perception by assessing PrEP eligibility among AGYW with ≥ 1 sexual-related risk factor and describing the proportion of AGYW reporting likely HIV exposures by PrEP eligibility status. Overall, 5364 eligible AGYW in Kenya ( Across countries, most respondents were YW (Kenya: 72.7%, Malawi: 72.3%, Zambia: 79.4%) who had ever been pregnant (Kenya: 74.7%, Malawi: 94.8%, Zambia: 67.3%; Tables  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Kenya Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  Nearly all respondents (Kenya: 98.7%, Malawi: 99.8%, Zambia: 98.9%) reported at least one sexual-related HIV-associated factor. Inconsistent condom use was the most prevalent HIV-associated behavior in all countries (Kenya: 75.3%, Malawi: 93.9%, Zambia: 74.8%). Violence survivorship (Kenya: 48.4%, Malawi: 37.5%, Zambia: 45.3%) and age-disparate sex (Kenya: 43.8%, Malawi: 33.4%, Zambia: 57.8%) were also prevalent. Believing partner(s) were likely exposed to HIV was particularly common in Malawi (Kenya: 16.0%, Malawi: 58.1%, Zambia: 8.3%). Table  After controlling for these sociodemographic and cognitive factors, correlates of likely HIV exposures included STI symptoms (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR] = 1.44 [1.03–2.01]) and partner(s)’ non-community residence (APR = 1.40 [1.00–1.95]), other partners (APR = 2.23 [1.51–3.28]), unknown status (APR = 1.81 [1.24–2.63]), and likely HIV exposure (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.82 [1.06–3.14], Yes: APR = 5.77 [3.95–8.43], ref: No). Table  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Malawi Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  After adjustment, transactional sex (APR = 1.37 [1.13–1.66]); multiple sex partners (APR = 1.21 [1.02–1.44]); alcohol use (APR = 1.22 [1.03–1.45]); partner(s)’ other partners (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.29 [1.13–1.47], Yes: APR = 1.43 [1.24–1.65], ref: No), unknown status (APR = 1.16 [1.02–1.33]), and likely HIV exposure (Yes: APR = 2.86 [2.40–3.41], ref: No); and physical (APR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) and sexual (APR = 1.56 [1.39–1.75]) IPV emerged as correlates. Table  Correlates of risk perception among currently sexually active AGYW in Zambia Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  Figure  Positive correlates of self-appraised likely HIV exposures among AGYW Figure  Distribution of HIV risk, PrEP eligibility, and Self-appraised likely HIV exposures † Malawi’s and Zambia’s national PrEP guidelines each included conditional criteria (Malawi: ever-pregnant + age-disparate relationships, Zambia: inconsistent condom use + multiple partnerships). This PrEP eligibility examination decouples these conditional criteria and treats each factor as their own criterion N/A = Not applicable because Kenya had no conditional PrEP criteria in their national guidelines In the PrEP eligibility column, Dark Blue indicates PrEP-eligible, and Dark Orange represents PrEP-ineligible. In the self-appraised HIV exposure column, Blue highlights self-reported likely HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW, whereas Light Blue represents unlikely exposures in this same group; Orange indicates likely HIV exposures among PrEP-ineligible AGYW, while Light Orange reflects unlikely exposures in the same classification Self-appraised likely HIV exposures were relatively low among PrEP-eligible AGYW (Kenya: 16.5%, Malawi: 48.5%, Zambia: 18.8%). Also, few PrEP-ineligible AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya: 6.4%, Malawi: 43.7%, Zambia: 4.8%). While Malawi’s and Zambia’s decoupled PrEP criteria did not proportionally increase self-appraised HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW (46.5% and 9.6%, respectively), the number of AGYW falling within these categories respectively increased by 74.4% and 31.8%. In this study with sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, self-reported likely HIV exposures were uncommon amid ubiquitous HIV risk (i.e., reporting ≥ 1 HIV risk factor). Correlates of likely HIV exposure primarily related to factors beyond respondents’ locus of control, spanning partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure (all countries), other partners (Kenya, Malawi), unknown status (Kenya, Malawi), non-community residence (Kenya); physical and sexual IPV (Malawi); and non-partner sexual violence (Zambia). Other correlates included STI symptoms in Kenya and transactional sex, multiple partners, and pre-coital alcohol use in Malawi. Exploring overlaps between HIV risk perception and PrEP eligibility highlighted that Kenya’s criteria captured most at-risk AGYW. Decoupling conditional criteria in Malawi’s (age-disparate sex + ever-pregnant) and Zambia’s (multiple partners + condomless sex) guidelines could improve risk identification. Self-reported likely HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligibility groupings, but decoupling Malawi’s criteria could increase PrEP engagement opportunities. Without improving AGYW’s actual-perceived risk disconnect, HIV prevention services and interventions will remain underutilized. Partnership-related factors, primarily in Kenya and Malawi, influenced AGYW’s HIV risk perception most, specifically partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, having other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence. Other studies also found partners’ behaviors and characteristics influence AGYW’s HIV risk perception [ Concordant with HIV risk research, AGYW’s survivorship of IPV and non-partner violence also affected HIV risk perceptions [ The remaining associative factors in Malawi—transactional sex, multiple partnerships, pre-coital alcohol use—and Kenya, STI symptoms, also aligned with epidemiologic data [ We found self-appraised HIV exposures were low in PrEP-eligible and -ineligible AGYW, suggesting most PrEP-eligible respondents are unlikely to seek out PrEP [ Our analysis supports that criteria-based eligibility might prevent sexually active AGYW from receiving the care and/or interventions necessary to reduce their HIV risk. By decoupling their conditional PrEP criteria, Malawi and Zambia could correctly identify > 85% of at-risk AGYW and potentially increase PrEP interactions by ~ 70% and ~ 30%, respectively [ In ESA, PrEP availability and accessibility has increased significantly over the past decade due to national governments partnering with bi- and multilateral partners, like the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) [ Our study has some limitations. We could not fully measure physical and sexual IPV in Kenya and Zambia due to questionnaire limitations: our null findings might misrepresent actual associations. Zambia’s models are possibly overfitted given the small number of events. Surveys did not measure or fully capture serodifferent relationships, injection drug use, PEP use (Kenya), and violence (Kenya, Zambia); thus, the number of PrEP-eligible AGYW might be underrepresented. Also, surveys used a 12-month recall period for most measures, while guidelines use a 6-month period, potentially inflating estimates of PrEP-eligible AGYW. Since all the data were self-reported, including HIV status, our data were potentially affected by social desirability, which could have attenuated effects and associations. Sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia are at increased risk for HIV. HIV risk perception could motivate AGYW to seek out, access, and use HIV prevention services and interventions, but AGYW’s low HIV risk perception often contradicts their actual HIV risk. In examining correlates of AGYW’s HIV risk perception, we discovered extrinsic factors—partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence; and physical and sexual violence from partners and non-partners—primarily increased AGYW’s HIV risk perception. Transactional sex, multiple partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use also increased Malawian AGYW’s risk perception, as did STI symptoms in Kenyan AGYW. Complementary analyses of overlaps between PrEP eligibility and risk perception highlighted self-appraised HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligible and -ineligible categorizations. To meaningfully increase access and use of HIV prevention services and interventions, improvements in AGYW’s HIV risk appraisal, identification, and perception are needed; deeper examination of the interplay between agency, behaviors, and perceptions would advance this goal. Otherwise, their current suboptimal utilization of HIV prevention services and methods will persist.

11470655,Halotolerant phosphate solubilizing bacteria isolated from arid area in Tunisia improve P status and photosynthetic activity of cultivated barley under P shortage,"Forty-seven (47) bacterial strains were isolated from soil of Gabes (an arid region in southern Tunisia) and were screened for their ability to produce Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) and to solubilize phosphate (P). The characterization and molecular identification of the most successful P-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) were then carried out. When grown on suitable artificial media, the most salt-tolerant strains also showed the highest P solubilization capacity (up to 126.8 μg ml","Phosphorus (P) represents about 0.2 % of plant dry weight and it is highly required for growth and development. Given its crucial significance for several metabolic activities such as DNA synthesis, cell division (growth and development), photosynthesis, and nutrient transport [ In order to enable crops to better cope with P deficiency, affordable and sustainable biological alternatives are needed to accelerate P transformation into bioavailable forms through multiple chemical reactions and biological interactions [ Regardless of their lifestyle, bacteria with plant growth promoting (PGP) traits are known to exert their effects on plants through several mechanisms, both direct and indirect [ There is a need to isolate P-solubilizing bacteria from the rhizosphere of several plants to have diverse applications in crop fields to maintain pH and to enhance phosphorus availability. The aims of this study were to (i) isolate phosphate-solubilizing bacteria from an arid soil, (ii) perform physiological characterizations and molecular identifications of the most successful phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB), and (iii) assess the efficacy of microbial inoculation on barley growth compared to the use of tricalcium phosphorus (an insoluble form of P that is inaccessible to plants thus remains in the groundwater). The soils studied (3 replicates each) were sampled from four different stations in the region of Gabes, southern Tunisia ( Geographical localization (GPS coordinates) of the four soil sampling sites (stations) located in the region of Gabes. Station 1 (N33°55′41.63″, E10° 4′44.89″), Station 2 (N33°56′2.34″, E10° 4′47.50″), Station 3 (N33°56′12.05″, E10° 4′48.86″), and Station 4 (N33°56′10.58″, E10° 4′45.31″). Physicochemical properties of the soil sampled from the four chosen stations in the region of Gabes. Geographical localization is indicated in  The selective isolation of bacteria to assess their aptitude to solubilize phosphate is generally performed using a selective culture on Pikovskaya medium [ The phosphate solubilization capacity of each bacterial isolate was determined in liquid Pikovskaya medium containing 0.5 % Ca The ability of different bacteria to produce Indole-3-Acetic Acid was assessed in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) containing tryptophan (10 mg l This test is based on the culture of bacteria on Petri dishes containing a solid nutrient medium containing different concentrations of NaCl. In the present study, the effect of salinity was tested on a Trypticase Soy Agar medium containing (in g l Bacteria strains were cultivated on Petri dishes containing Trypticase Soy Agar medium whose pH was adjusted to different values. pH tolerance test was carried out by adjusting the pH of the medium to 5, 7 (control), 8, 9 and 10. On each dish, 10 μL of a culture of initial cell density of 10 The temperature response of selected bacterial isolates (10 μL of a culture with an initial cell density of 10 Amplification of the 16S rDNA gene was carried out using the universal primers S-D-Bact-0008-a-S-20 (5′- AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and S-D-Bact-1495-a-S-20 (5′- CTACGGCTACCTTGTTACGA-3′) [ Selected bacterial isolates were plated on Luria Broth (LB) agar plates and incubated at 28 °C in the dark for 24 h. Bacterial cells were then harvested from LB agar plates, transferred to Luria-Bertani liquid medium (LB medium) and cultured at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. After centrifugation at 8000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min, the obtained pellet of each isolate was washed twice with 50 mM phosphate saline buffer (PBS) and resuspended in 50 mL of sterilized distilled water at a concentration of 0.5 McF equivalent to 10 Seeds of cultivated barley (Ardaoui variety: widely cultivated in Gabes were first sterilized and were sown in plastic pots (2 Kg) containing sterile sand (after autoclaving at 120 °C for 20 min) and cultivated for two months in a greenhouse under controlled conditions as follows: 16:8 h photoperiod (day:night), 20–25 °C temperature, and 65–75 % relative humidity. pH of the freshly prepared nutrient solution was 6.5. With regard to the final concentration of KOH used for pH 7.5 adjustment, it was 2 mM. For pH 7.5 fixation, Good's buffer 5 mM HEPES (pH 6.8–8.2; pKa = 7.55) was added to the nutrient solution. As for the stabilizer, to prevent ion precipitation, we used iron as 20 μM Fe-EDTA. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is known to have a high stability to prevent nutrient precipitation particularly phosphorus. Besides, the nutrient solution was renewed each 72 h. The experimental units were arranged according to a completely randomized design (CRD). Six seeds of barley were sown in each pot and three seedlings per pot were maintained after germination. The experimental design contains different treatments (9 replicates per treatment: three pots containing three plants each) as follows: Treatment 1 (T1): soluble phosphorus (KH The Hewitt nutritive solution was used for growing plants in sand [ Desiccated samples were ground to a fine powder using porcelain mortar and pestle, then digested in 4/1 (v/v) HNO Besides P content, P absorption efficiency (PAE) and P use efficiency (PUE) were calculated [ PUE reflects the dry weight increase per unit of P content (mg DW μmol Net CO Total chlorophyll (as mg g Here, A is the absorbance at specific wavelengths, Vis the final volume of chlorophyll extract in 80 % acetone (100 ml), and W is fresh weight (100 mg). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), using StatisticaTM software was performed to detect differences between treatments. Mean separation procedures were carried out using the multiple range tests with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) (P < 0.05). The electrical conductivity ranged from 2.52 ms cm With respect to mineral elements ( By using Pikovskaya medium containing tricalcium phosphate as the only source of P, we succeeded in isolating several bacteria, characterized by their variability in morphology (e.g. color, shape, size, and speed of growth). Forty-seven bacterial isolates showed a common yet variable ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate, based on the appearance of a clear zone around the bacterial colony after a few days of incubation on Pikovskaya medium ( Selected phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (BSP) isolated from soil in 4 stations. Variability in P release from tricalcium phosphate was observed among the bacterial isolates ( Differential ability of the strains isolated from soils 1 to 4 in Gabes region to solubilize phosphorus, expressed as P released from tricalcium phosphate (means of 3 replicates per strain). Bars labelled with the same letter are not significantly different at 5 % according to Fisher's LSD test. Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) concentration released by the strains varied between 27.57 μg ml Variability of IAA production among strains (means of 3 replicates per strain) isolated from soils 1 to 4 in Gabes region. Bars labelled with the same letter are not significantly different at 5 % according to Fisher's LSD test. The study of P solubilization and IAA production activities by the selected strains allowed us to classify them into several groups, independent of their soils of origin ( Clustering of the isolates sampled from the different soils based on their capacity to produce IAA and solubilize P. The salt tolerance aptitude of the selected isolates was studied in solid culture medium enriched with NaCl at increasing concentrations: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.5, and 10 %), The salt tolerance index (STI), measured as the ratio between the bacterial colony diameter when incubated under a given NaCl salinity and the diameter of the colony from control conditions, was calculated. Globally, most of the isolates challenged with salinity (1 %–5 %) showed STI values higher or equal than 1, suggesting an improved or maintained growth under salinity ( Responses of selected bacterial isolates to increasing salinity in the medium (0–10 %) expressed as salinity tolerance index (means of 3 replicates per treatment and per strain). As mentioned in  For each isolate, the pH tolerance index was calculated on the same basis as for STI. Response to pH variation in the culture medium was found to be strain origin-dependent ( Responses of selected bacterial isolates to pH (5, 7, 8, 9 and 10) expressed as pH tolerance index (means of 3 replicates per treatment and per strain). The results of the temperature tolerance tests showed that irrespective of their origin, the tested strains coped with high temperature (37°-45 °C), based pm their respective tolerance index values, which were generally greater than 1 at 45 °C (up to 1.82 in GS2a strain from soil 2) ( Responses of selected bacterial isolates to temperature (10, 28, 37, 45 and 50 °C) expressed as temperature tolerance index (means of 3 replicates per treatment and per strain). Post-sequencing of the 16S rDNA genes, 11 strains were selected: GS1a and GS1c from soil 1; GS2b from soil 2; GS3e, GS3b, GS3g, GS3j, GS3k and GS3m from soil 3; and finally, GS4d and GS4f from soil 4. Comparing 16S rDNA sequences of the selected strains with those present in the GenBank database revealed that these strains were distributed over three bacterial genera ( Phylogenetic tree constructed using GENETYX software based on the sequences obtained from the 16S rDNA of the isolates. The method used is called Neighbors joining (NJ). Considering the length (in bp) of the sequences obtained and the strain identifications, the identities as well as the percentage of similarity between the various sequences were determined. Most were found to be  After performing the characterization and molecular identification of selected phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (BSP), the effect of inoculation by these strains (8 BSP) on growth and development of barley plants cultivated for 60 d in the presence of tricalcium phosphorus (an insoluble form of P that is inaccessible to plants) was determined. Plant growth (as root length, shoot height, shoot, and root dry weight), photosynthetic activity (as total chlorophyll content and leaf gas exchange parameters) and P status were measured. Generally, inoculation with PSB strains under optimal P levels resulted in a slight but significant improvement of shoot biomass (as DW) compared to the control ( Effect of the inoculation with the 8 most effective phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (BSP) strains selected from soils 1, 2, 3, and 4 on growth of two month-old barley plants (growth stage: second node of stem visible). Shoot and root biomass production ( It is noteworthy that morphological observations confirmed the depressive effect of P shortage on shoot growth as compared to the control ( Vegetative development of barley plants cultivated for two months under optimal P supply (control) or TCP-induced P deficiency. Control non inoculated plants ( A marked reduction in leaf chlorophyll content (−26 %) was observed in plants grown in the presence of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) compared to control plants ( Effect of the inoculation with the eight most effective phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (BSP) strains selected from soils 1, 2, 3, and 4 on leaf pigment content and photosynthetic gas exchanges of two-month-old barley plants (growth stage: second node of stem visible).

Isolates were able to cope with salinity reaching up to 7.5 % NaCl despite some variability occurred, whereas viability of most strains was suppressed at 10 % NaCl. This diversity of salt tolerance was also documented [ Tolerance of the selected isolates to pH variation was studied in solid culture medium. In this test, the following pH values: 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were used. pH 7 served as a control treatment. According to Kumar et al. [ The capacity of the selected isolates to tolerate different temperatures was studied in solid culture medium incubated at increasing temperatures (10, 28, 37, 45 and 50 °C). Data showed that none of the isolates was able to grow on a culture medium incubated at 50 °C, but all investigated strains were able to survive at 45 °C. Bacteria tolerance to high temperature is a complex phenomenon because it involves proteins and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). During exposure of  Altogether, the bacterial isolates investigated in the present study showed a variable behavior to variation in pH, temperature, and salinity. Microbiome of soils in arid ecosystems is diverse and rich in several extremophile microorganisms that could be exploited to improve plant response to environmental stressors, including phosphorus scarcity. To facilitate P uptake by cultivated plants, using soil-borne beneficial microorganisms, such as PSB as eco-friendly agents is gaining interest [ Inoculation with PSB significantly improved plant growth grown despite the presence of tricalcium phosphate (TCP). This growth stimulation was mainly observed in plants inoculated with GS3m ( Relationship between IAA production (as μg ml Hence, inoculation with high IAA producing bacteria (e.g. GS1c, GS4f and Gs3m) was associated with the highest root length under P shortage. It has been documented that the elongation of plant root system for water and nutrient uptake needed for plant growth was enhanced by the production of auxin by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria [ Data obtained also indicated that bacterial strains GS1c ( Some PSB also improved P status in barley under tricalcium phosphate (TCP), as evidenced by the strong increase of P content (as μmol g Relationship between P solubilization capacity (as P mg l The mechanisms involved in P solubilization and used by soil microorganisms include: (i) the release of metabolites for mineral dissolution of soil particles, e.g. organic acids, siderophores, protons, hydroxyl ions, and CO In response to phosphorus deficiency barley plants adopted several mechanisms, phosphorus acquisition efficiency (PAE) is a vital adaptive trait for plants growing in low P conditions, since increased PAE might reflect a better capacity of the root system to explore larger volumes of the rhizosphere and hence improve plant capacity to take up available P. Data inferred from the present study ( As conclusion, it could be inferred from the present study that inoculation with PSB strains isolated from arid areas (generally seen as marginal zones) in Tunisia can be considered as a promising environmentally friendly technology to increase the availability of Pi from organic phosphorus form (tricalcium phosphate), resulting in an increase of barley growth under P limiting conditions. In this work, the selected phosphorus solubilizing bacteria are characterized as high salinity tolerant, high IAA producers and high phosphate solubilization ability as well as able to grow over a range of alkaline pH (from 8 to 10). Therefore, a more attention could be needed to investigate the ability of selected bacterial strains to solubilize and mobilize inorganic phosphorus in calcareous soils to enhance crop production of barley under natural condition.

11468863,Methamphetamine abuse impairs sequential working memory,"The ability to maintain and manipulate sequential information in working memory, referred to as sequential working memory, plays a vital role in our daily life. While research has shown that methamphetamine abuse affects the neural substrates and the overall functioning of working memory, its specific impact on sequential working memory remains unclear. In this study, we asked 62 abstinent methamphetamine-dependent participants and 59 control participants to complete a digit ordering task in which they saw four digits one-by-one over time and subsequently rearranged them in ascending order. The four digits were presented either randomly in the experimental condition or in ascending order in the control condition. Results show that methamphetamine-dependent participants performed worse than the controls in the experimental condition in which sequential working memory was needed to complete the task, but not in the control condition in which only short-term memory was needed. This finding demonstrates that methamphetamine abuse impairs sequential working memory.","Methamphetamine is a potent stimulant that exerts significant effects on the central nervous system. It has been found that the abuse of methamphetamine can lead to significant and enduring neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in individuals ( Indeed, extensive evidence documents impairments of working memory by methamphetamine abuse, in the n-back task, digit span task, delayed match to sample task, spatial working memory task, among others ( Sequential working memory refers to the ability to maintain and manipulate the order of items in working memory, a function that differs from the mere storage of information (i.e., short-term memory) related to individual items, such as their identity, pattern, or color. This ability is essential for various cognitive processes, encompassing verbal activities such as speech perception and spelling, as well as nonverbal activities like planning and goal-directed behavior ( Two earlier studies employing a sequential working memory task, however, failed to yield findings supporting this hypothesis ( In the current study, a substantial number of participants were examined using an enhanced sequential working memory task. During this task, participants were presented with four unique numerical digits in sequence and subsequently required to recall the digits in ascending order following a delay. Crucially, the digits presented were either in a random order or in ascending order. The former condition requires participants to re-order the digits in working memory, while the latter does not ( We enrolled 62 abstinent individuals dependent on methamphetamine (32 females, M_age=27.3 ± 4.2 years, M_education=9.4 ± 1.5 years) who met the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder according to the DSM-5 ( Participants’ demographic information and methamphetamine use characteristics. It is important to acknowledge that the control group comprised individuals who were older (95% CI of age difference = [6.47, 10.14], p < 0.001) and had received a higher level of education (95% CI of education difference = [0.24, 1.33], p < 0.01) than the methamphetamine group. In China, individuals with addictive behaviors typically have lower age and educational levels. However, due to the development of the education sector in China, there are not many people in the local community who match the methamphetamine group in both age and educational level. If we insist on using an age-matched control group, it will increase the educational level disparity between the two groups, while using an education-matched control group will increase the age disparity between the two groups. Ultimately, we relaxed the age restrictions during participant recruitment to ensure that the differences in age and educational level between the two groups were not too large. In the subsequent statistical analyses, we controlled for the differences in age and educational level between the two groups. The experimental procedure was programmed using E-Prime 3.0 and conducted on a 17-inch laptop computer (screen resolution: 2240x1400, 60.02 Hz). Participants were brought into a standardized behavioral laboratory in batches, ensuring no communication or interaction among them to prevent any mutual interference. Each participant sat facing the computer, with a distance of 60 cm between their head and the computer screen. The experiment contained two blocks of stimuli, each containing 31 trials (15 ordered trials, 16 random trials). In each trial, participants were presented with four distinct digits, written in Chinese characters, sequentially at one digit per second ( Task structure: The task included interleaved random and ordered conditions. In each trial, participants were presented with four distinct Chinese characters representing numbers one by one. They were required to remember the order of these numbers based on their magnitudes. In the ordered condition, the numbers appeared in ascending order, while in the random condition, the numbers were presented in a random order. After the delay, participants had to judge whether the hollow dot indicated the target position of the digit probe by pressing buttons with the right hand. In the Ordered condition, the numerical order of the digits was inherently clear and only short-term memory was needed to store the digits. In the Random condition, participants needed to rearrange the digits in memory before reporting them in numerical order. The comparison between the Random and Ordered conditions served to isolate sequential working memory manipulation. Trials with a reaction time (RT) shorter than 0.2 seconds or longer than 5 seconds were excluded from data analysis. A total of 29 trials (15 in the Methamphetamine Group), representing approximately 0.38% of the initial 7502 trials, were excluded from the analysis. The RTs and response accuracy were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model. For the fixed effects, we included condition, group, and their interaction. For the random effects, we included a random intercept and a random slope for condition, for each participant. To control for the effects of age and level of education, we included them as covariates in the models. All data analyses were conducted using the stats models package ( For accuracy data, the main effects of participant group (Coef=0.042, SE=0.03, p=0.16) and experimental condition (Coef=-0.031, SE=0.024, p=0.192) were insignificant. The interaction was significant (Coef=-0.11, SE=0.033, p=0.001). A simple effects test revealed that methamphetamine-dependent participants performed worse than the control group in the Random condition (F(1,119)=6.57,p< 0.05), but not in the Ordered condition (F(1,119)=0.35,p= 0.55). Notably, neither age (Coef=0.003, SE=0.002, p=0.201) nor level of education (Coef=0.009, SE=0.008, p=0.268) had significant effects.  Task accuracy for each participant across conditions. The dashed line represents chance level, and each point represents one participant. For RTs, although the main effect of experimental condition was significant (Coef=0.049, SE=0.024, p=0.04), neither the main effect of participant group (Coef=0.043, SE=0.097, p=0.658) nor the interaction between group and the condition (Coef=0.005, SE=0.033, p=0.884) reached significance. Similar to the accuracy data, age (Coef=-0.003, SE=0.007, p=0.645) and level of education (Coef=-0.002, SE=0.025, p=0.933) had no significant effect on RTs.  Average reaction time for each participant across conditions. Each point represents one participant. In this study, the impact of methamphetamine abuse on sequential working memory function was investigated by applying a sequential working memory task to 62 individuals with methamphetamine dependence and 59 healthy controls. Results showed that individuals dependent on methamphetamine exhibited lower performance compared to the controls in the Random condition but not in the Ordered condition. This finding provides evidence for the hypothesis that methamphetamine abuse impairs the functioning of sequential working memory. The present finding not only complete previous studies on the impact of methamphetamine abuse on working memory but also provide explanatory insights into the impact of methamphetamine on cognitive processes involving sequential information. Two previous studies have tested methamphetamine-dependent participants and normal controls with a behavior assessment kit covering a list of activities such as comprehension and planning, financial ability, communication skills, transportation, household skills, and medication management ( Although the neural mechanism of the impaired sequential working memory was not the target of the current study, integrating the present finding with those on patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) nevertheless allow us to gain valuable insights into this issue. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, resulting in the loss of dopamine primarily in the basal ganglia ( In conclusion, by employing a task tailored to isolate the functioning of sequential working memory and by testing a relatively large pool of participants with methamphetamine abuse, the current study demonstrates (again) that methamphetamine abuse has profound impacts on diverse aspects of working memory, including the sequential processing of information that has not been examined in previous studies.","['working memory', 'sequential working memory', 'cognitive deficits', 'methamphetamine dependence', 'digit ordering task']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Psychiatry,STI
11468210,Barriers and facilitators to women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services in rural Australia: a systematic review,"Accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in rural Australia presents complex challenges that negatively impact women’s health and exacerbate health inequities across the life course. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the barriers and facilitators to women’s access to SRH services in rural Australia, considering both supply and demand dimensions. We systematically searched peer-reviewed literature published between 2013 and 2023. Search terms were derived from three major topics: (1) women living in rural Australia; (2) spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and (3) barriers or facilitators. We adopted the “best fit” approach to framework synthesis using the patient-centred access to healthcare model. Database searches retrieved 1,024 unique records, with 50 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed access to primary care services ( This review highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SRH service access disparities in rural Australia. Understanding the barriers and facilitators women face in accessing SRH services within the rural context is necessary to develop comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions informed by a nuanced understanding of rural women’s diverse needs. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11710-9.","Access to healthcare is a multifaceted indicator of healthcare system performance and equitable care provision [ Access is a complex concept, defined in spatial and aspatial terms [ 
 Patient-centred access to healthcare dimensions and determinants. (Adapted from Levesque et al. 2013 conceptual framework) [ Australia’s inequitable distribution of health services is well documented, and issues associated with access are often influenced by Australia’s vast landmass, challenging geographic environments, and sparsely distributed populations in rural areas [ Previous reviews have focused on specific types of SRH services, such as abortion services [ This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ The PICOS mnemonic was used to frame the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table

A comprehensive list of search terms was developed from a preliminary search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases and a review of relevant literature, such as SRH systematic reviews. The keywords in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used to index articles were utilised to develop the full search strategy. A combination of search terms related to the following concepts: [1] women living in rural, regional, or remote Australia; [2] spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and [3] barriers or facilitators to access. A supplementary file outlines the complete search strategies (see Supplementary file  All identified citations were collated and uploaded into Endnote (Version 20.2.1, Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA). Citations were then imported into Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were dual-screened in Covidence by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC) using the prespecified eligibility criteria. Potentially relevant studies were retrieved as full texts and dual-assessed in detail against the inclusion criteria by three independent reviewers (SW, LA, AC). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage were recorded. Reference lists of included studies were screened for additional studies. Any reviewer disagreements during the selection process were resolved through discussion with the third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies by SW using Excel and tabulated with the following headings: author, year, health service setting, health discipline, context, geographic location according to MMM or ASGS-RA, population characteristics, study objective, study design, barriers, facilitators, summary of findings, study limitations, and implications. Ten per cent of the extracted data were cross-checked by another reviewer (LA). Any reviewer disagreements were resolved through discussion or with an additional reviewer. Quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for the appropriate study design (e.g., analytical cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, cohort studies) [ Study characteristics (e.g., barriers or facilitators, SRH service) were tabulated and synthesised narratively to describe the available evidence.

 Summary table of included articles ( Staff from community-based non-government Women’s Health Centres ( Rural women who had an abortion in the last 15 years ( General practice Maternity care Clinicians ( Aboriginal women ( Healthcare consumer Healthcare provider Indigenous girls ( Health professionals ( The highest proportion of studies were conducted in New South Wales (NSW) ( The highest proportion of studies were focused on maternity care settings ( Key barriers and facilitators are presented under the five dimensions of the patient-centred access to healthcare model (Fig.  Approachability represents the capacity of a health system to provide services so that women with health needs can identify and reach them [ Three main barriers were identified for approachability: insufficient information, fragmented healthcare pathways, and limited internet access. Insufficient information primarily related to gaps in the information provided by GPs around maternity care providers [ Three main barriers emerged related to women’s ability to perceive healthcare: low health literacy, limited awareness, and difficulties in navigating the health system. The barrier of low health literacy was predominantly related to cervical screening [ Two main facilitators were identified for approachability: health system improvements and enhanced education and institutional approaches. Health system improvements pertained to changes to the health system, such as providing culturally accessible information and roles for Aboriginal Health Practitioners (AHP) to work with the community and coordinate access to screening services [ Three facilitators were identified for women’s ability to perceive healthcare: information access, knowledge and awareness, and culturally appropriate information. Information access was primarily related to internet access, as this was the most common way women accessed information, and ease of access to information determined the choice of provider [ Acceptability relates to cultural and social factors that affect a woman’s ability to accept or seek health services or aspects of them. For example, the gender or social group of the provider or the beliefs associated with systems of medicine may reduce the acceptability of seeking care [ Three primary barriers were identified for acceptability: negative provider attitudes, low-quality care, and privacy concerns. Negative provider attitudes were frequently reported by women and included GPs’ unwillingness to refer for abortion services or denying care altogether, leaving women needing to locate willing providers themselves [ Three barriers were identified for women’s ability to seek healthcare: lack of cultural safety, stigma, embarrassment and perceived judgment, and community context challenges. Lack of cultural safety primarily affected maternity care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, whereby standard maternity care was not deemed culturally safe, with limited cross-cultural understanding of medical care [ Three facilitators were identified for acceptability: inclusive and culturally sensitive practices, enhanced privacy with flexible service delivery, and improved health system practices. Culturally sensitive practices involved ensuring cultural safety and consulting women on their cultural needs around birth [ The main facilitator for women’s ability to seek healthcare was related to care preferences. Birthing in the local community was reported to be a positive experience for women [ Availability and accommodation refer to the ability to access health services and healthcare providers, both physically and promptly. Availability means enough health resources to provide services, including the providers’ characteristics (e.g., presence of the health professional, qualification) and how services are delivered [ Three barriers were identified for availability and accommodation: poor local access, inadequate health service availability, and limited provider availability. Poor local access was related to the lack of and fragmented local services. For example, ultrasound or pathology services were not available at the same location as the care provider, requiring patients to travel [ Three barriers were identified that impacted a woman’s ability to reach healthcare: transportation issues, increased travel, and relocation for care. Transportation issues were particularly relevant for women without a driving licence or car, as they had to depend on public transportation or family and friends [ Facilitators identified for availability and accommodation encompassed the enhancement of local service provision and capacity, and increased resource accessibility. Strategies to enhance local service provision and capacity involved increasing their capacity [ One facilitator was identified for women’s ability to reach healthcare: time and travel efficiency. This was related to telehealth appointments [ Affordability pertains to a woman’s economic ability to allocate resources and time to necessary health services. The direct costs of services, related expenses, and the potential loss of income influence it. Affordability can differ based on the type of service and relies on the ability to acquire the resources needed to cover care costs [ Two primary barriers to affordability were identified: high direct costs and costs associated with essential products. The high direct costs identified across multiple studies included limited bulk-billing options [ Two barriers were found to hinder a woman’s ability to pay for healthcare: high travel-related costs and the financial burden of indirect costs. High travel-related costs were reported in four studies for women who were required to travel for care [ Two facilitators emerged for affordability, including cost reduction strategies, and policy and incentive support. Cost reduction strategies involved the increased use of telehealth services due to lower associated costs [ Service affordability was identified as a facilitator for women’s ability to pay for healthcare. Improving access and availability of MToP appointments and medication in rural areas was found to be much more affordable than accessing SToP [ Appropriateness refers to the overall clinical benefit for the woman and whether the expected health benefits (e.g., improved quality of life) outweigh the potential negative consequences (e.g., time, cost). Appropriateness also includes adequacy, which pertains to the quality of the type and model of services provided and their continuity [ Two barriers were found for appropriateness: limitations in telehealth accessibility and care discontinuities. The limitations in telehealth accessibility were linked to language barriers for non-English speaking women and the absence of visual cues for the visually impaired [ Two barriers were also identified for women’s ability to engage in healthcare, including a lack of support systems and psychological effects. Lack of support systems pertained to women who were required to relocate to give birth. Women who relocated experienced disconnection and distress from leaving family support and also reported inadequate caregiver support for existing children [ Two facilitators were identified for appropriateness, including telehealth accessibility and patient-centred care. One study found that the accessibility of telehealth helped to promote relationship-building with a provider before the patient was required to travel [ Thirty-nine studies (78%) were assessed using the JBI quality appraisal tool for qualitative design, while sixteen studies (32%) were evaluated using the JBI quality appraisal tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. A supplementary file includes the quality appraisal for all studies (see Supplementary file  To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesise the evidence on the spatial and aspatial barriers and facilitators that women experience in accessing SRH services in rural healthcare settings in Australia. This review highlighted significant barriers and facilitators from supply and demand access dimensions. Many of the facilitators to SRH access identified in this review relate to women’s empowerment. Empowerment refers to the ability of women to make choices and exercise agency and decision-making through expanded access to and control over resources and changes to the institutional structures that affect their lives [ Health literacy can contribute to women’s empowerment and agency by giving them the tools to access, understand, and use health information to participate in shared decision-making, which is essential for enabling patient-centred care [ Patient-centred care was a facilitator identified in the appropriateness and ability to engage dimension. Continuity of carer was identified as a significant factor in access to maternity care, also highlighted in other systematic reviews of access to antenatal care in high-income countries [ Despite emphasising patient-centred care, negative provider attitudes pose significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly accessing abortion care in rural areas. A recent scoping review highlighted the relationship between negative attitudes, abortion stigma and quality of care, contributing to the gatekeeping and obstruction of abortion access [ In addition to addressing negative provider attitudes, it is crucial to acknowledge the affordability and ability to pay dimension, as the financial barriers further hinder access to essential SRH services for women in rural areas. Some women in the included studies reported a lack of information and difficulties accessing financial incentives for maternity care relocation, such as Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) [ Healthcare expenses paid directly by individuals in Australia comprise 17 per cent of the country’s healthcare expenditures [ Beyond the immediate health implications, it is essential to recognise the broader societal benefits associated with improving access to SRH services in rural communities. Addressing the barriers to accessing SRH services in rural areas holds wider societal benefits, including economic and social outcomes [ Considering the critical need to address barriers to SRH access in rural Australia, policymakers must prioritise targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility. First, there is a pressing need for health service redesign and interventions prioritising women’s empowerment and control over their health. Further research across different states, particularly those with significant rural populations (e.g., Western Australia), is essential to capture the diverse needs of these communities and ensure patient-centred care. This includes the prioritisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s voices in developing culturally safe antenatal care models and addressing barriers to antenatal and birthing care, especially in rural and remote Australia. Further, there needs to be a consistent use of geographic classification systems relevant to policy in rural research to facilitate decision-making from findings [ A strength of this systematic review is the use of rigorous and robust methods to identify, appraise and synthesise the literature pertaining to the barriers and facilitators to spatial and aspatial access to women’s SRH services in rural Australian healthcare settings. In particular, the comprehensive search and selection process identified a large number of included studies published in the last ten years. This review builds on existing evidence to understand health service accessibility in Australia [ Identifying the barriers and facilitators for women in accessing essential SRH services within the rural context is a necessary step for the development of comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions that address the diverse needs of rural women. Our study supports the need for targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility in rural areas. These include a comprehensive review of Medicare rebates and PBS subsidised items to enhance affordability and accessibility to SRH care, investment in digital healthcare infrastructure, and health service redesign prioritising co-design and a person-centred approach to ensure the service meets the needs of rural women. Further research is required to target the access barriers to SRH services and address the disparities in health service distribution and health inequity in rural Australia.

11467999,8th Public Health Palliative Care International Conference: Building Bridges between Science and People,,"
 
 
 Dear Colleagues Dear Friends It brings me immense joy to extend a warm welcome to every one of you to the 8th Public Health Palliative Care International Conference in Bern, the cozy and beautiful capital city of Switzerland. We invite you to experience the charms of Bern, an ancient city at the gateway to the breath-taking high mountains of the Alps. Two years ago, we met in Bruges, Belgium, for the 7th PHPCI conference and experienced there a fantastic conference embedded in the Compassionate City of Bruges. Next to the conference program, we had the exciting artistic track and during the conference week, the Compassionate City was organizing the city festival, embracing several local initiatives on the themes of serious illness, long-term care, mourning and loss. I am very pleased that we can offer you this year an equally interesting and exciting conference in Bern. During the conference week, several activities and events will be hold in the City of Bern, in collaboration with the Compassionate City Bern. The scientific and cultural programs have been carefully prepared by the committees and this gathering promises to showcase the many aspects of public health palliative care from all over the world. The cultural engagement with the City of Bern provides an opportunity to see how the civic, social and healthcare worlds can partner to support compassionate communities and compassionate cities. This conference promises to be an extraordinary gathering, showcasing the pinnacle of progress in public health palliative care, a practice and research domain that is rapidly evolving. Addressing the complex needs of the seriously ill, death, dying, loss and bereavement requires collaboration across professional groups and disciplines. Let us embark together on a journey to identify and engage researchers and practice experts in public health palliative care, fostering creativity and innovation. We encourage each of you to take full advantage of this unique opportunity at the conference to connect with fellow attendees both within and beyond the confines of our conference venue. It is my fervent hope that the conversations, insights, and knowledge gained during this conference will galvanize public health palliative care worldwide, charting a course toward a brighter future for all those in need of compassionate care. I extend my profound gratitude to the members of the preparatory committees (Organizing Committee, Scientific Committee, Committee of the City Programme, Committee of the German-Speaking Countries, Committee of the Swiss Programme) and to all volunteers for curating an exceptional program, rich in content and relevance. All names of people involved in these committees can be found on the conference website ( Lastly, I extend my deepest appreciation to each one of you for your commitment to public health palliative care. Your presence at the 8th PHPCI Conference in Bern is a testament to your dedication, and I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to engage with you in stimulating discussions and meaningful interactions at the conference. On behalf of the Council of PHPCI, I wish you all a stimulating and engaging conference. 
 Luc Deliens, president of PHPCI On behalf of the scientific committee of the 8th World Congress of Public Health Palliative Care International, PHPCI 2024 in Bern we warmly welcome you from across the world to this beautiful and historic city. We wish to acknowledge and thank the outstanding contributions from delegates across the world, and to our highly motivated scientific committee representing all continents. We are pleased to present this stimulating conference abstract book to you. More than ever, the topics of dying, caregiving, and grieving represent pressing and urgent challenges across all societies: an end of life in dignity is far from guaranteed and the necessary confidence, capacity, and resource are dramatically lacking across the world. This is why research, practice, and support must raise its voice and become political – drawing on evidence, and united in a will for change. As highlighted in recent landmark papers, we realize the enormous challenges for the near future: the increasing number of people in need for support until death, the worldwide injustice in access to high quality health care, the need to recognise and respond to the wider determinants of living and dying well, the decreasing number of professionals entering or staying in their job, and the lack of a political will to develop skills and confidence for caring for each other in solidarity. But hope is in the air: this abstract book showcases many initiatives and projects that demonstrate that the creativity and conviction in how we connect with each other at the end of life reflects the level of mutual respect across the whole life course. We are convinced that this conference will mark the beginning of many new ideas not only on paper, but in reality. Through ‘Building Bridges’, the conference’s theme, we hope that everyone will be moved to shift the current status quo through the connection with others. Building bridges within and across the communities we are part of. Even if small in size compared to the dimensions of the global challenges before us, the sheer number and potential of the presented projects offer a unique opportunity to stay optimistic: compassion is the essence for our global survival.

A thematic analysis was conducted. 
 
 
 
 University of Manchester, United Kingdom The aim of my research was to offer an authentic personal narrative of what matters to people at the end of their lives. I sought to attend to death as an integral life experience that brings about distinct and meaningful connotations of selfhood and identity. Principally, I sought to understand how (or if) the social construction of gender, and social difference more broadly, is important to our end-of-life experiences and wishes. To attend to the nuances of experience in death and dying, I adopted an ethnographic people-centered approach with a series of semi-structured interviews which held a loose structure of questions but prioritised storytelling and participant-led interview direction. One of the most pivotal findings of my study were that death had a catalytic effect on gender identities. My research found that gender had a cognitive role in experiencing and talking about death whereby the differential social roles of women and men proliferate at end of life. This substantiated the analytical standpoint for the study’s findings; summarised as: 1. People pre-empt their end-of-life considerations through their understanding of their gender. Notably, my female participants all fixated on the notion of the ‘altruistic caregiver’ as explanatory of their end-of-life wishes whilst the men were deeply engaged in the finances and ‘overseeing’ of the family as their priority. 2. Gender foregrounded the justification of people’s thoughts and experiences of death through the primacy of their identification of women and men. My participants expressed worries about their death as bounded by their understanding of their own gendered expectations of duty of care for others in their family; largely their children or spouses. 3. Death can reaffirm or challenge gender and its’ animations; but this is not linear. Gender knowledges and identities can be equally complicated by our reflections on death, which was exemplified by the men who I interviewed that each experienced a sense of renegotiation in their gender identity through their personal experiences of death. In turn, this changed the way they both felt and experienced emotion. My research demonstrates the crucial need for future research on death, dying, and gender whilst indicating the pivotal differential priorities which matter to people at the end of their lives. Further, my findings offer a complicated perspective on the differential support needed for men and women in end-of-life conversations.

 In analyzing the data, Statistical Analysis will be employed using Pearson R vs. Spearman rank correlation coefficient which is still subject for assumptions testing for the quantitative phase. Whereas, thematic analysis will be used to analyze the narrations of the primary caregivers’ lived experiences. Finally, integration technique of connecting and developing joint analysis will also be employed prior to the second phase of data collection. This integration technique will be used from the quantitative phase to inform and link to subsequent data collection for the qualitative phase. Mixed-method meta-inferences will also be drawn to show if the results from the quantitative phase are confirmed, discordant, or expanded from the themes created from the qualitative phase. 
 
 Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium Wider social networks are increasingly recognised in supporting people with care needs. Health promoting initiatives around the end of life aim to foster these social connections but currently provide little insight into how willing people are to help neighbours facing support needs. This study describes how willing people are to help neighbours who need support practically or emotionally, whether there is a difference in willingness depending on the type of support needed, and what determines this willingness. We applied a cross-sectional survey design and distributed 4,400 questionnaires to a random sample of people aged >15 across four municipalities in Flanders, Belgium. These surveys included attitudinal and experiential questions related to serious illness, caregiving and dying. Respondents rated their willingness (scale 1-5) to provide support to different neighbours in hypothetical scenarios: (1) an older person in need of assistance and (2) a caregiver of a dying partner. A total of 2,008 questionnaires were returned (45.6%). Average willingness to support neighbours was 3.41 (case 1) and 3.85 (case 2). Helping with groceries scored highest; cooking and keeping company lowest. Factors associated with higher willingness included optimistic outlook about receiving support from others, family caregiving experience, and prior volunteering around serious illness or dying. People are generally willing to support their neighbours who need help practically or emotionally, especially when they have prior experience around illness, death or dying. This suggests a potentially large informal support network which is available to all. Initiatives promoting social connection and cohesion around serious illness, caregiving and dying may harness this potential through experiential learning.

 Uniklinik Köln, Germany 
 In collaboration with a locally based secondary school in 2007, the idea for a project day for senior pupils on dealing with dying, death and bereavement was born. The objective was to establish a secure space beyond academic demands, encouraging open communication and the development of coping strategies for adolescents. This initiative supports young people in engaging thoughts on “dying, death and bereavement” while offering guidance without overwhelming them. It empowers adolescents to address emotional needs, fostering openness on this challenging topic and promoting self-help through intuitive competencies, self-worth and personal coping strategies. In 2012, an expert symposium led to the creation of a handbook for teachers and hospice workers. The second symposium in 2013 shaped a curriculum for training teachers and hospice workers as multipliers. Since 2015, nationwide seminars have trained nearly 500 multipliers, implementing the project in different school forms, supporting pupils in addressing “Dying, Death, and Bereavement.” 
 
 Uniklinik Köln The first focus group revealed a special role for hospice volunteers. They are neither part of the family system nor of the full-time care, they contribute a lot of time and have no therapeutic mandate. Hospice volunteers wish for training courses that focus on their special position, to use language that was understandable to laypeople and preferred face-to-face to online formats. For relatives, it emerged that, on the one hand, it is important to reflect who really has a desire to die and specifically for whom. In addition, relatives experience particular burdens that result in their own need for support. They wish for short online information and exchange formats in which desire to die could be discussed as neutrally as possible. Based on these results, the existing training program was adapted for hospice volunteers and a digital two-hour format for relatives was developed, piloted, and evaluated.

 The Medical City, Philippines 
 
 The 2015 Quality of Death Index has listed the Philippines, out of 80 countries, as one of the worst places to die. The country scored poorly regarding the quality of end-of-life care available. In December 2015, the Department of Health (DOH) issued an Administrative Order, the “National Policy for Palliative and Hospice Care in the Philippines.” In November 2023, the Department of Health (DOH), in partnership with Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital (JBLMGH), led the development of the first Philippine Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on palliative and end-of-life care (PEOL) for adult patients with cancer. This local CPG will be used for policy and benefit package development and disseminated widely through various channels.

 NSW Health, Australia Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations experience several barriers in accessing palliative care supports and services. Common barriers, including language, health literacy and differences in beliefs around death and dying, impact experiences of care and can often result in underutilisation of palliative care supports and services. This is especially relevant for the South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) in Sydney, Australia, where 68% of families speak a language other than English at home, and more than half its residents (52.7%) born overseas, compared to the 33% national average. This project aimed to use a community-based approach to increase dialogue about palliative care, including death and dying matters, among South Asian populations. It aimed to engage and educate South Asian community leaders on key areas, including the local healthcare system, with particular emphasis on the Palliative Care Service. A mixed methods design was utilised. 3 Multicultural Health Officers (MCHOs) engaged in a User Experience (UX) workshop and identified South Asian populations across SWSLHD at greater risk of lower service use. In response, a 3-hour culturally specific educational forum, incorporating culturally appropriate storytelling and discussions on palliative care, was delivered to 40 South Asian community members and leaders. The forum was evaluated for changes in knowledge and understanding of palliative care among participants through pre-and-post surveys. Three main themes from the UX Workshop informed the forum’s agenda: (i) lack of awareness of palliative care and its services; (ii) family and support systems and (iii) faith and spiritual beliefs impacting on palliative care service utilisation. Evaluation of the forum reported 100% of participants having learned something new or valuable from the forum and the majority (77.8%) of participants reported increased confidence talking about and accessing information on palliative care and end of life. The forum’s use of personal storytelling, interactive discussions, and culturally sensitive approaches had a positive impact on increasing knowledge, skills, and value of palliative care among community members and leaders of South Asian origin. Replication of this culturally sensitive intervention is being undertaken, with a specific focus on expanding the work to include the engagement of younger South Asian community members to continue the conversation. 
 
 NSW Health, Australia Libraries are an essential component of the compassionate communities model. Their role as community hubs, providing a range of cultural, health and social programs, supports the nurturing of community life, with the role of librarians often likened to ad hoc social workers. Despite this, little has been done to engage libraries across the South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) in Sydney, Australia, in developing compassionate communities. This project aimed to build compassionate libraries by first equipping librarians across the SWSLHD with the knowledge and tools to support community members accessing information and resources regarding palliative care, illness, dying, death and bereavement. A quasi-experimental design was utilised based on a 2020 report by the SWSLHD Palliative Care Service, which found all (6) surveyed council librarians believing education and training about palliative care, life limiting illnesses, death, and bereavement to be beneficial. In response, a pilot 2-hour educational palliative care workshop, incorporating local palliative care services, relevant case studies and the role of libraries in compassionate communities, was delivered to librarians from the local government areas of Camden, Narellan and Oran Park. The workshop was evaluated for changes in knowledge and confidence in supporting community members around death and dying matters among participants through pre-and-post surveys. Four librarians from the Camden Community Libraries participated in the workshop. Findings included: (1) 100% of librarians strongly agreeing to being able to define palliative care in comparison to 28.6% prior to the workshop, (2) 100% increase in awareness and confidence of accessing information about SWSLHD palliative care services and (3) 66.7% feeling much more confident in having conversations about palliative care and end of life. This workshop has helped develop the knowledge and skills librarians possess to offer greater support to community members accessing information about palliative care services. The strong engagement observed among librarians in this intervention advocates for further work in this area. The SWSLHD Palliative Care Service aims to extend this intervention to neighbouring libraries across the district and further look at developing and/or tailoring existing library programs to enhance the compassionate communities model.

 In current clinical practice, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAKs) have gained importance as both therapy and prophylaxis. The survey was answered by 41 of 62 (66%) of experts. The majority (36/39, 92%), would generally consider secondary prophylaxis with a DOAK in the case of a previous DVT and LE in a cancer patient, and a life-expectancy of 3-6 months, provided there is no contraindication. Main reasons were the high risk of VTE recurrence and the benefit to the patient’s quality of life. Substance of choice was apixaban (27/32, 84%). Discontinuation was considered with a life expectancy of ⩽ 2 weeks (13/33, 39%) or a few days (12/33, 36%). Twentysix experts reported difficulties in decision making in case of TVT/LE in end-of-life care. 
 
 University of Auckland, New Zealand Semi-structured interviews with patients and family members who had received telehealth calls Focus groups and individual interviews with health professionals working in palliative care using telehealth. Data was analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. The key outcomes of the study include the development of a conceptual definition of rapport for clinical interactions based on the patients and family findings. Along with an adapted “Model of rapport and relatedness” which highlights participants experiences of interactions characterised as Connectedness, Disconnectedness, and Pseudo-rapport. This study adds important new knowledge about what constitutes rapport and how it is experienced during telehealth calls. This knowledge is useful for communicating to connect with patients and families. 
 
 Palliative Care Association of Uganda, Uganda In 2020, Uganda initiated a pioneering endeavour to integrate palliative care data into the national HMIS. A technical working group was formed, periodic meetings were held, and tool drafting was done followed by pretesting, and approval by the Ministry of Health. HMIS OPD 008 Unit Palliative Care Register HMIS 105c Health Unit Palliative Care monthly report. Over 50% of facilities offering palliative care in Uganda are reporting through the system and this has provided a more comprehensive understanding of palliative care services at facility, regional and national levels.

 1) Idea: Day after day, many terminally ill patients pass away without having had access to the care they would have needed. This is partly due to a lack of knowledge, apprehensions, misunderstandings, myths, and taboos surrounding palliative care among the general public, patients themselves, their close ones, and some healthcare professionals. Faced with this realization, it appeared necessary to create new ways of raising awareness and educating the general public and healthcare professionals who are not specialized in the palliative care approach. Thus was born the idea of a collaborative documentary theater project, focusing on the transition to palliative care, and serving as a starting point for a citizen conversation on the topic. 2) Achievements: Through the implementation of a rigorous participatory research-creation process, combining qualitative and art-based research methods, our transdisciplinary team co-created a sensitive, truthful, and educative play on palliative care. The fictional work was constructed and validated using the perspectives of patients, their close ones, and palliative care professionals, as well as during public readings. The final play was presented 15 times in the format of a video recording, followed by discussions with the audience. Furthermore, the play has been presented in an academic context to students in medicine, psychology, social work, nursing science, and bioethics. Pre-post descriptive and qualitative data on the understanding of palliative care, among other things, were collected after each presentation of the work. 3) Conclusion/Lessons learned: The collected data show that watching the play could contribute to a better understanding of palliative care among the general public and healthcare professionals who not specialized in the palliative care approach. The results further suggest that theater could be a relevant cultural mediation modality to demystify palliative care and dispel certain associated taboos. Nonetheless, certain challenges remain regarding the broad dissemination of the work, particularly in reaching marginalized populations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hospizgruppe Freiburg e.V., Germany Over the years different projects and changes to services (individual counselling, walking group, dancing group, gatherings at death cafes, discussion group for young widowed women and men, etc.) have been developed. Co-operations with different institutions and services have been built. A special service has been established to support grieving children, adolescents and young adults. This requires openness to face an unfamiliar reality. This open mind approach of care helps to meet the new and greater needs of our more diverse everchanging society. It needs flexibility of all people involved. It enhances resilience and seeks to discover underused or not all used human resources.

 Swiss Red Cross, Switzerland To make matters worse, people with a different socio-cultural background often have different perceptions of dying and death. Adequate information and awareness are needed in future, to improve the quality of life for these people in the terminal phase of life. Implementation Materials have been developed to make professionals and volunteers in various outpatient and inpatient palliative care settings more aware of migration-specific issues and improve their transcultural skills. Theoretical principles, exercises and other tools, such as checklists and questionnaires, have been developed or compiled based on the questions that arise in practice. The content has a modular structure so that the focus can be adapted to fit the individual. The exercises are used for introspection into one’s own actions and can be worked on in groups or individually. Module 1: Dealing with diversity – transcultural competence Module 2: Transcultural communication in a palliative care setting Module 3: Different perceptions of illness, dying and death Module 4: Relatives and decision-making Module 5: Spirituality, rituals, returning to the country of origin The modules were tested in training sessions with the staff of a Spitex institution and a retirement and nursing home. 
 
 The results of this project can be used to develop important recommendations for action for companies and organisations. The implementation of last aid providers in the workplace can be a promising approach to sensitively support people in burdensome situations at work. The more employees and managers know about the theoretical background, the better they can provide appropriate support.

 Haruka Community Palliative Care Support Center Social connection is essential to human well-being. To live a good life one needs mutual help and support from others, especially when faced with aging, serious illness or other troubles. In the city in northern Japan where I work as care manager, however, demographic aging is going on in a significant manner and the elderly people in growing numbers are socially isolated with the high percentage of elderly and single-person households. In addition there are those residents who relocated from east coastal areas after the 2011 East Japan Earthquake and subsequent. They often lack social connections. This leads to hinder not only cooperation and mutual assistance at the time of disaster but individual inhabitant’s good life. For the past 18 years, I’ve been leading a community project, based at local community palliative care support center, to foster ‘community connectors’ who accompany individual patients and families as well as palliative care volunteers. The training curriculum emphasizes the importance of experiencing the presence of the others with one’s mind and body. Developing compassion and new relationships, future ‘community connectors’ learn to act on their own initiatives. They support patients and families, take part in rehabilitation programs, and share treasures of local community with multi-generational and multinational residents. Our continuous efforts bear fruit of compassionate community and manifold social network. Mutual helping and supporting relations are built. When some patients find it challenging to go out, ‘community connectors’ visit their home and sing their favorite songs together. In times of bereavement, community members gather together to remember the dead, with Buddhist sutra chanted by terminal cancer priest who once suffered with alcoholic dependence. Some ‘community connectors’ host amateur singing contest with local residents, inviting people with multi-generational and multinational backgrounds including home care patients, care facility residents and those who moved from disaster affected areas. By remembering each life of fellow companions and expressing their own feelings in words, they get emboldened to live their own lives. By supporting others, they realize that they are also supported. We thus witness the emergence of compassionate community. 
 
 In Japan, demographic aging and decrease in population are going on in a significant manner. Social isolation of the elderly is one of the most serious social issues with changes in household structure. In rural areas it is difficult to secure enough medical professionals and caregivers with population concentration into major cities. New social ideas are needed to modify the governmental policy measure ‘community-based integrated care systems’ and the idea of Compassionate Cities and Communities (CC) is attracting more attention. Against this background we will share the ideas and practices of emerging CC in rural areas in Japan and their partnerships with CC in England. Participants, who are interested in community building in rural areas or exploring initial stages as well as current state of CC in non-European or East Asian contexts, will enjoy opportunities to enhance their understanding of CC and meet with new partners. Compassionate Communities Japan (CC-JP) was launched at the Japanese Society for Hospice and Home Care Conference in October 2023. There is now a CC-JP network meeting virtually each month with over 30 regular participants and several areas of Japan are starting to get involved in CC-JP activities. There is also a growing movement of CC-JP for Young Adults who recognise the importance of compassionate communities for their age group too. This proposed workshop consists of 4 short presentations, followed by dialogues with participants. The introductory presentation will be delivered by a Japanese philosopher, who translated Allan Kellehear’s

 School of Health Sciences Fribourg, HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland–Fribourg The aim of the poster will be to illustrate the approach of an optional course in nursing training on healthy dying from a community health perspective. We will present the content of the course and the reflections we had about “social representations”, “health promotion and death – what synergies” and “community care and healthy dying”. This module will be conducted over 5 days (1 week). It will start in January 2025 and will have three objectives: Conceive the link between health promotion and death, in particular by being able to explain the concept of “healthy dying” and “community care”. Reinforce, in the context of palliative care, one’s health promotion posture by developing a project. Develop a relational approach to health with the person in palliative care, in relation to bereavement and end-of-life issues. Examine the evolution of one’s representations of death and health. This project-based approach enables the empowerment of their health promotion posture and a reflection around death and the patient needs. To encourage their success, the lessons give some information on the health systems partners and the state of the art of contextual practice of healthy dying. 
 
 Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Ireland The survey questionnaire contained 110 questions, three of which were open-ended and 107 of which were closed-ended. The survey captured experiences of care provided in the last three months of life in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and the home. Questions regarding the standard of coordination between services and healthcare staff who cared for a person in the last three months of their life were included. A communications plan was successfully implemented to maximize the survey’s response rate. This included raising awareness of the survey via social media, information webinars and radio advertisements.

 have explored different potential approaches to making workplaces more compassionate communities in relation to death, dying, loss and care; have thought about the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches; be more aware of some of the real-world challenges intrinsic to encouraging more compassionate workplaces; have shared and learned about existing relevant workplace resources to support employees faced with serious illness, death and bereavement. The workshop draws on one research-based and one practice-based case study across five European countries where projects are underway to encourage more compassionate workplaces: the EU-CoWork project and the Scottish Bereavement-Friendly Workplaces Toolkit and Bereavement Charter Mark. EU-CoWork is co-creatively developing tailored Compassionate Workplace Programs in 12 workplaces across 4 European countries (BE, SE, AT and GR), employing developmental evaluation and an international mixed methods process and impact evaluation. In Scotland, work is underway to encourage employers to create more ‘bereavement-friendly’ workplaces through use of the Bereavement Charter Mark for Employers and the Scottish Bereavement-Friendly workplaces toolkit. Brief presentations on each project will outline their aims, approaches, challenges and learnings. Small group discussions will give delegates the opportunity to share their own experiences in this area; view and discuss some of the resources used in the case study areas; and think about whether elements from these projects might be of use in their own context. There will also be opportunities for questions to speakers and plenary discussion of key issues.

 There is an expression that community organizers flirt with in hopes it will be true:  Nova Scotia is home to 1 million people, many living in rural and semi-urban communities. GGNS was the first festival in Canada to bring the topic of grief into public view. Across 8 days, we hosted 36 events both virtually and in person. Advertising included social media, posters, radio and television engagement. Activities embraced the tenets of grief literacy in the following ways: - They were tailored to different ages, communities, genders, sexualities, incomes, and geographic locations. Many events were on-line. Most events were physically accessible, and at least one had sign language interpretation. - They included a range of griefs. For example, widows grieving their spouses; pet owner grieving their companions; newcomers reflecting on what they had to leave behind in their home countries. - They were in public places: For example, the main library in the provincial capital hosted a display of memorial tattoo photographs; people talked about their grief over restaurant meals; folks gathered in a park to learn about death doulas; people joined online to discuss estate planning; grievers missing their deceased pets went on hikes together. - They were hosted by individuals, community organizations, health care institutions, faith-based organizations, and research teams. Most events were free; some had ‘pay what you can’ entry fees. 
 This workshop is for anyone who would like to contribute to growing grief literacy in their networks and communities.

 The facilitators will introduce the participants to each other then the concept of compassionate communities. Compassionate communities are rooted in a health promotion approach to palliative care and encouraging end of life care within communities. In many cultures, taking care of the sick and dying was done within communities and in the past cultures had ways of supporting such individuals and families. The culture evolved due to colonization, modernization, education and uptake of religion. Many individuals now live and work in urban centers. Research shows that many patients still prefer to die at home but this is often not possible due to perceptions within communities. It is perceived as neglect when a patient dies at home and other challenges such as lack of caregivers or living in rental houses also makes it difficult to honour wishes of the dying. Many individuals end up dying in hospitals surrounded by healthcare providers and medical machines. Compassionate communities is therefore a public health approach to provision of palliative care by creating interactions between palliative care providers, local or government administration and communities. 
 The facilitators will ask participants to give their experiences on starting or running compassionate communities. The focus will be on how they started, what has worked for them and what lessons they have learned. These can be shared by upto 5 participant. 
 The participants will be split into smaller groups of about 7 – 10 participants and asked to discuss for 10 minutes and create a check list of items, resources, personnel that are crucial before starting a compassionate community. The session will be wrapped up by presentations from the group and creating one checklist.

 Mobile camps were designed to prevent and address essential SRH needs including gender-based violence, which are exacerbated during disasters. Integrated psychosocial support within the comprehensive SRH services can have profound effects on the affected population. Reviewing the programmatic data helps in identifying the unmet needs and re-strategizing the response intervention and advocacy, contributing to improving the overall health outcomes. 
 
 
 
 Compassionate Communities UK, United Kingdom Based on the participants, the questions related to ‘talking confidence’ and ‘practical hands on support’ scored well. However, when the questions started to ask about factual knowledge and access the results were reversed. This demonstrated that how information has been shared has not been effective. On the questions related to priorities, the data demonstrated the importance of emotional support, social connectedness and time with friends and family being of greater importance than other elements such as physical care or pain relief.

 Sue Ryder, United Kingdom Sue Ryder (SR), the UK’s bereavement charity, started its Grief Kind campaign in 2021, after research found that people struggled to support other who had experienced a bereavement. Grief Kind aims to educate the nation to meet grief with warmth, rather than shying away from conversations. SR created a TV ad to ensure grief is something that is normalised and talked about in the UK households. This has been watched by millions of people across the UK and has increased traffic to the website and sign ups to our online bereavement services. In October 2021, we launched our Grief Kind podcast series. In each episode, a SR Ambassador was joined by a celebrity who reflected on their bereavement journey and talked about who helped them through grief. To date, we had over 100,000 downloads. In 2022, SR launched Grief Kind classes, 5 short video tutorials, in which our SR bereavement experts talk viewers through what grief is like and how you can support others who are grieving. Viewed over 37k times, they provide valuable support to organisations and individuals to be Grief Kind. In 2022, SR launched The Empty Chair campaign, an exhibit with a dining table surrounded by 13 empty chairs that encouraged the public to be Grief Kind and offer those who are grieving a chair at their dinner table. The powerful exhibit made a real impact with coverage reach totalling 9.5 million+. It was taken to parliament to engage with MPs to encourage them to sign up to be more Grief Kind. Other public engagement campaigns included installing a red London phone box on Brighton seafront to encourage people to be honest about their feelings of grief and an artistic campaign to show how the senses can impact people’s grief when they least expect it.SR also places regular grief advice and thought leadership pieces in the media. A recent radio day reached over 9 million people. Grief Kind allows for lobbying work with the government, raising the profile of grief and what people need: bereavement leave, service pathways or grief on the school curriculum. Recently, SR has set up Grief Kind spaces across the UK, offering peer-to-peer support groups in cafes, hotels and local community centres. This public health campaign continues to grow and develop and has inspired services worldwide to use the materials and resources. It meets people where they are - shopping, walking by the sea, waiting for a bus, in their home or workplace and tackles issues important to raise and offering guidance.

 Most Significant Change analyzes narratives detailing transformations from an intervention, deriving, through consensus, one story that contains the most significant change. The Attentive Visitors workshop, in which 19 interviews were conducted with volunteers who participated in a training program in Flanders, provides an example. The process of deriving relevant stories from these interviews and working with stakeholder organizations to reach consensus about most significant change will be discussed. Contribution Analysis is aimed at inferring causality in complex programs. Using an iterative process, it enables researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to identify the contribution an intervention, and additional factors, has on a particular outcome. A theory of change is generated at the start of the evaluation and subsequently confirmed or revised during implementation. Examples of its application in the UK will be provided. Ripple Effects Mapping is designed to actively involve program stakeholders in describing and visually mapping their perceptions of the effects of a program. Two examples of REM will be provided, exploring: i) the ripple effects stemming from Compassionate University (Belgium) and ii) a modified use of REM to study the dissemination of the DöBra cards (Sweden)

 Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft, Austria However, the “Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft” facilities (day hospice, “Mobiles Palliativteam”, outpatient clinic,ward) are also available to sick people within a short distance if required. Early palliative care, a multidimensional approach, as well as trust and continuity of care are sought and made possible. This is guaranteed by the cooperation with the association fort he homeless. Medical care for the uninsured, basic medical care service provided by the Red Cross and Caritas. Targeted social counseling is offered by the “Verein für Obdachlose”. Stays at the Hospice House are covered by “Tiroler Hospizgemeinschaft”. The project is currently being implemented in the Innsbruck area. The specific support measures include accompaniment to doctors and hospitals. Possibly the return to he regular systems, “translation” of medical diagnoses and recommendations, organization of medication and aids. Care- especially wound care, acute interventions, sometimes just being there and listening. The project ist currently being financed by donations until 2026. 
 Many breaches of trust- it takes time to approach and build a relationship. The topic of bringing people into the center of society. Educational work – sensitizing society and the health system. It needs housing for sick and uninsured people. Involvement of those affected. Development and training for volunteers. Interdisciplinary approach. Colloboration with all homeless and homeless assistance facilities. Possibly scientific support Compassion and solidarity. 
 
 Northumbria University, United Kingdom Material Legacies is a five-year collaboration with The Hospice of St Francis, UK that uses practice research methods to co-create a collection of experiential artifacts, four documentation films, a series of specialist talks and two public exhibitions with three bereaved makers. This research creates novel practices that redefine the role of artistic collaborations with the bereaved, creating alternative spaces for a person’s physical and digital legacy. Material Legacies locates its approach to bereavement within continuing bonds theory, where the bereaved may explore a continued relationship with the dead (Walter, 1996). The narrative turn within hospice care (Gunaratnam and Oliviere, 2009) has potential to readdress the balance between “psycho-dynamic and artistic methods” (p.2), explored materially in art therapy literature (Mahony, 2001; Moon, 2010; Moon, 2016). Within this research a narrative approach is used to create conceptual prompts within the process of making – layering stories within the material as artifacts form and through the addition of sound and projection mapping. Documentation films [ Using co-design acknowledges that the bereaved have a distinct and nuanced knowledge of their relationship to the loss (Sanders & Stappers, 2008) and tackles traditional hierarchies around client-based therapy. By reflecting on a sustained two-year co-design process with the bereaved, this research advocates that in sensitive contexts collaborators must have agency at all stages of the design process, otherwise as solutions or products begin to form they impose design decisions on the community rather than activate collaborations with them (Bowen et al, 2013). This paper explores the diverse formats needed to develop ethical design practices that incorporate digital and public engagement through transparency, personal choice and collaboration.

 ACP is a process that is open to everyone - not just people at the end of life. Through ACP, individuals reflect on their personal values, wishes, and expectations regarding treatment and care in the event of illness or accident, thereby enhancing self-determination. There are different ways of dealing with the topic. The aim of normalizing ACP does not mean imposing a norm: there is no «right or wrong» in dealing with these sensitive issues. Measures to ensure that ACP becomes a normal part in life for all people who want it, regardless of age, place of living, phase in life, origin, health literacy and health condition; Assistance in appointing an authorized representative and in reflecting about unforeseeable and/or complex medical events, as well as dying and death; Supporting healthcare professionals in addressing ACP by strengthening their communication and methodological skills; Improving the quality and accessibility of documentation and the framework conditions for the remuneration of ACP services. The roadmap forms the basis for concrete projects to be implemented in the coming years. The challenge and at the same time the strength of the national initiative lies in the networking and cooperation with a large number of independent administrative, scientific and political structures. The aim is to continuously involve all the stakeholders at different levels and secure their support of.

 Prior research show that nursing students may experience dying as frightening, and feel uncertain and unprepared to communicate with patients nearing death and their families. An interactive learning activity was therefore created, including preparatory self-reflection on end-of-life preferences using the Swedish adaptation of the GoWish cards – the DöBra cards – followed by a seminar with group discussions.

 Heard about the development of Compassionate Schools, including engagement processes and possible actions, as generated via the Compassionate Schools European Learning Network. Reflected on how they would develop and facilitate their own Compassionate School, from their personal and professional perspectives. Engaged in critical discussion around the commonalities and essentialities in developing Compassionate Schools. This includes increasing awareness of and reflection on the availability and need for resources, readiness, inclusion of relevant partners, and the facilitation methods required to develop a Compassionate School. Compassionate Schools are places which are attentive to and actively address the educational and support needs of its community (students, staff, and families) at times of serious illness, caregiving, death, and bereavement. They recognise that these events are universal experiences that have an individual and collective impact and, as such, warrant attention: which today is not always the case. Through a series of actions, preventive measures, and educational activities, Compassionate Schools aim to meaningfully integrate such experiences into school life. Furthermore, by providing school communities with the proficiency to respond to such events, valuable skills are gained that both students and staff can use throughout their lives. This interactive workshop will introduce participants to the variety of possible actions that can be facilitated in and with schools, sharing learning from the Compassionate Schools European Learning Network. Participants will then be supported to engage in an in-depth discussion on steps they can take to develop their own Compassionate School, drawing on their local context and own positioning. Finally, participants will be provided with an overview of the commonalities and essentialities in the development of Compassionate Schools, exploring key issues around resources, readiness, partnership working, leadership, and the range of facilitation methods required to develop a whole schools approach to caregiving, serious illness, death, and bereavement. 
 
 
 
 Hopitaux Universitaire de Geneve, Switzerland According to two Swiss surveys, many elderly people would like to die at home. Reality is different and most die in hospital. There are numerous reasons for this discrepancy, notably the lack of end-of-life drugs available at home. General practitioners may be unfamiliar with prescribing and administering the “Four Essential Drugs Needed for Quality Care of the Dying,” which include analgesics, anti-secretory and/or sedatives. Trained and available home care teams are needed to support patients and provide active palliative care. General practitioners may not have palliative training, and palliative care team intervention may not always be possible/necessary. To assist these physicians, a comfort care order set was developed in conjunction with palliative care training. Order sets have proven to reassure, guide clinicians and prevent prescribing errors, thereby improving patient safety. Project: Computerized comfort care order sets for common end-of-life symptoms such as pain, anxiety, agitation, shortness of breath, and death rattle were created by an interdisciplinary group of geriatricians and palliative care specialists. Goals include preventing medication errors, promoting patient safety, and facilitating accurate end-of-life prescribing. Order sets include established protocols, doses, and non-drug interventions. Physicians can select the appropriate medication from a recommended list based on symptoms and efficiently change the dose/frequency. Once signed, medications appear in the patient’s record, also visible when the patient is admitted. It can also automatically generate a prescription for the pharmacy. Evaluation: A questionnaire will be sent to physicians using these comfort care order sets to assess their experience in prescribing end-of-life medications before and 3 months after implementation. A short training course in palliative care will be offered. Results will be analyzed based on improvement in physician comfort with prescribing and ease of prescribing the system’s integrated order sets. Comparison of opioid prescribing and documentation errors pre and post. Our hypothesis is that comfort care order sets will increase primary care physicians’ comfort level with prescribing of essential medications for end-of-life care at home and improve anticipation of emergency situations. These comfort care order sets may contribute to patient safety in general and may be extended to other settings, such as general internal medicine wards.

 Fondation Rive-Neuve, Switzerland This practical project is part of the need to rethink Palliative Care (PC) from a sustainable perspective. Our foundation currently offers specialist palliative care (SPC) in hospital and is recognized as a center of expertise: it receives patients, their families and relatives. Established in the heart of a small town, our foundation is characterized for its close links with the local population, making it easier to understand the specific needs of the context. It is currently engaged in a process aimed at expanding its range of support services. The project, which has a human dimension, promotes a community care approach, emphasizing collaboration with community health organizations and local health institutions to provide care centered on the specific needs of each patient. In this region, there is no access to first line specialized palliative care at home or in nursing home. The introduction of a new model aims to provide 1st line primary care directly at home and in nursing home by offering a 24/7 telephone hotline (for patients and staff) to respond concretely with field interventions in case of palliative emergency needs. The service will provide a full assessment, personalized medical treatment, coordination with existing teams and advanced technical care, all under the supervision of a medical and nursing team. For several years, health professionals and hospital management have been making clinical observations, which is supported by research into scientific and political findings. In order to adapt the project to the context, an analysis of resources was necessary. At the same time an assessment of barriers and facilitators was undertaken. Careful planning, proactive risk management and taking advantage of opportunities can ensure the success of such a pivotal initiative for the community. It remains essential to be agile and resilient in the face of challenges throughout the project. The sustainability of the Swiss healthcare system is being significantly challenged, highlighting the fact that medicine is based on a model of infinite progress, raising expectations that are oQen unrealistic, while the financial and human resources required are limited. This project to improve access to PC is designed to be implemented in the context of the evolution of the healthcare environment and the needs to support societal changes aimed at ensuring its sustainability

The workshop will further explain the rationale and methodology used to identify the social and economic impact of this approach and explore how this methodology and tools can be used to support attendees’ work. Interactive discussions will explore what evaluation tools attendees have used for the different target groups in their programs, what they were aiming to achieve and what worked or did not work when formal and informal networks have partnered together. 
 
 Scaled mean scores between the DLI-revised and the shorter version were assessed for statistical differences. The internal reliability of the DLI-revised and shorter version was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. For the shorter version, an EFA identified a 9-item, two-factor structure model. The model demonstrated an excellent fit with TLI and CFI values exceeding 0.95 and SRMR less than 0.05. The measurement invariance showed a comparable means between males and females. The DLI-9 and DLI-29 were strongly correlated (0.98). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for both revised DLI scales and subscales and the shorter version of the DLI exceeded 0.8, indicating high internal consistency. 
 
 295 (24.5%) reported that they had learnt about end-of-life issues, including death, dying, and grief, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. One in twenty people (67) cared for someone dying with COVID-19, while one in ten (135) experienced the death of a close family member or friend due to COVID-19. Two in ten (219) knew someone who died from COVID-19. Around 28% (341) of the participants attended a funeral, while 10% (111) organised a funeral during the pandemic. Similarly, 303 participants (25.2%) said that they learnt about end-of-life issues because of the introduction of VAD laws in Australia. Nearly 5% (59) reported having a caring role for someone approved for VAD. Ninety participants knew someone planning to use VAD, while 80 knew people who died using VAD. Participants reporting any form of experience related to the COVID-19 pandemic and VAD had significantly higher death literacy scores (including scores on overall index, scales and subscales) than those who did not. 
 It has been previously reported that Death Literacy is a concept that develops through personal, work and education experiences. This study provides further insights into the development of death literacy.

 Hogeschool Rotterdam Online dialogue sessions involving discussions with both students and staff were held, revealing that many students grapple with grief and loss. Interviews were conducted among staff regarding their experiences with DGLC in the workplace, highlighting an individualised need for attention at these subjects. In a minor course on palliative care, students undertook an assignment on art and grief, interviewing fellow students on the subject. This resulted into a recommendation for the incorporation of art-based solace in RUAS. Furthermore, various “drops” were implemented to draw attention to DGLC. These included the director’s acknowledgment of grief and loss at the academic year opening; a table in the central hall featuring a journal for anyone to write about what matters, along with cards containing inspiring questions that passersby can answer; and posters focusing on DGLC. In “living room conversations” staff and students shared stories about DGLC; evaluation indicated that sharing personal experiences in a safe space at school and workplace, fulfilled a need to feel heard and understood, a practice they wish to continue. We contributed to the film ‘Connecting Communities – Inspiring perspectives on palliative care’ by Agora and PZNL, launched during the 2023 EAPC World Congress. Amongst other initiatives, the film portrays the development of the C-UAS. 
 
 When interested, offer gradually intensifying ways of engaging in hospice movement to enable a prompt start in volunteering and first practical experiences for young adults they can further build on. Within services and institutions value diversity in people, tasks and ways of training and supervision. Thus, acknowledge individual strengths and experiences different people contribute to the movement. Bring together the new and young and the old and approved as both share the same core values of hospice care and their motivation for volunteering is similar. Finally, volunteers in hospice movement are more than companions to the dying. They serve as multiplier of the hospice culture within their own peer groups contributing to increasing death literacy in society.

 CS Caritas Socialis GmbH, Dementia-Friendly 3rd District, Vienna,Austria The dementia-friendly 3rd District was established in 2014 with the goal of developing and promoting awareness and civic engagement. Various offerings are intended to reach people with dementia and forgetfulness, as well as their relatives and companions, in a low-threshold manner. The dementia-friendly 3rd District is a growing care network centered on individuals who need guidance and counseling. Since its founding, one of the primary goals of the network partners has been sustainable awareness-raising, knowledge dissemination, destigmatization, and visibility of forgetfulness and dementia. The network is characterized by its openness to new trends and societal developments, which represents another goal. Following this objective, the “Promenz Gruppe 1030” has been part of the network since 2023. In line with the first objective of the Österreichische Demenzstrategie (Austrian Dementia Strategy), “Ensuring participation and self-determination of those affected,” representatives of the network worked together with PROMENZ between autumn 2022 and summer 2023 to implement the project “Promenz Gruppe 1030.” The necessary resources for this were distributed among the network partners. The first “Promenz Gruppe 1030” was able to start in September 2023. Users benefit from both the exchange and counseling, which fosters supportive relationships, and from becoming self-advocates who speak about their condition at conferences and collaborate in working groups with Gesundheit Österreich GmbH. In each of the regular network meetings, the network partners exchange proven practices and new ideas. Central to these considerations is the question of resources. Ideas and actions can only be implemented in small steps using the network’s own resources. Implementation is done voluntarily or as an organizational contribution from the participating network organizations. Despite this, the network is growing and is committed to “Dementia Literacy,” because dealing with dementia and forgetfulness must become natural. To achieve this goal, sustainable awareness-raising and knowledge dissemination at various levels, as well as the participation of those affected and the enabling of experiential knowledge in the population, are what the dementia-friendly 3rd District network tirelessly and continuously strives for.

 Workshop participants will learn: a systematic and transferrable method for designing invitations to convene community groups that explicitly declare the aspirational intention of the convenor, a worked example of an invitation that is personalised to the participant’s context that they can take away and implement, and an enhanced understanding of how to describe the intended experience of the group memeber, as well as being transparent about what is expected of them. An aim to spread the Compassionate Communities movement is for organisations and individuals to identify reciprocal benefits in forging new collaborative partnerships. The importance and potential of a well-crafted invitation to bring about intended collective action is often underestimated. The art of invitation involves so much more than communicating the basic details surrounding an event or occasion. It refers to a set of skills and practices to attract, inspire, and motivate people to coalesce on a mutually beneficial theme. The intended outcome of their collective action will be to generate positive change. To spread the principles of public health palliative care requires involvement across diverse sectors of society. When convening community-based action learning groups - the invitation initiates the collaborative process. The invitation influences group size and membership, which can mediate the success of subsequent group activities. However, community organisers can feel unsure about how to take this first step. How can we increase our confidence that the people who turn up to a community meeting are the intended people we are hoping to engage and that they are clear on the expectations we have as convenors? In the workshop, attendees will engage in a systematic yet creative method of inviting community participation and convening groups of likeminded people around a mutual theme of interest. The skills they will learn are transferrable to other activities linked to co-production. Each workshop participant will leave with a personalised example of an invitation they can use in their unique context. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In this workshop the participants will: Learn about the genesis of, and drivers for, the development of a pan-Canadian collaborative on equity-oriented palliative care; Identify barriers and develop solutions to integrate equity-oriented palliative, identifying the critical role that context assessment plays in successful implementation processes; Consider lessons learned from a pan-Canadian implementation of equity-oriented palliative care, reflecting on challenges, successes, and the adaptations required to achieve equitable, safe, and high-quality care for (and with) structurally vulnerable populations; Identify best practices for equity-oriented palliative care; and Develop skills to become champions (or allies) in improving palliative care access and gaining access to practical tools and resources for local, national, and international implementation. 
 The “Improving Equity in Access to Palliative Care” (IEAPC) collaborative is a pan-Canadian initiative to improve access to palliative care for individuals experiencing homelessness or vulnerable housing. The collaborative examines equity-oriented approaches to care that address systemic and structural issues and identifies innovative practices in implementing equity-oriented palliative care for people experiencing structural vulnerabilities. The IEAPC collaborative is a four-year initiative that supports over 20 communities representing 85+ organizations across Canada to design, deliver and evaluate equity-oriented palliative care initiatives in their respective communities. Communities receive funding, access to subject matter experts, site visits to leading equity-oriented palliative care models in the country, peer-to-peer learning and collaboration, and a tailored curriculum that supports all aspects of implementation. In this workshop we will present information about the IEAPC collaborative, sharing lessons learned, tools and resources developed, and evaluation strategies. Following didactic presentations from clinicians, researchers, educators, and health administrators, we will engage participants in interactive small group work to design equity-oriented strategies for implementation in their own communities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 SatiSaanti, Thailand End-of-life and palliative care often revolve around planning and transitioning to death for individuals. Simultaneously, the emotional landscape involves navigating palliative care and pursuing one’s life purpose and goals. It is crucial to recognise that palliative care is not solely relevant to older individuals; early awareness benefits all, fostering understanding of life, acceptance, and making the most of our time. Advanced dementia necessitates palliative care to ensure a dignified death, presenting challenges such as diminished decisional capacity and reliance on proxy decision-making. Stigmatisation exacerbates these difficulties, leading to rejection, discrimination, and social exclusion, necessitating concerted efforts to raise social awareness. In Thailand, fostering such awareness is crucial, and adopting an art-based approach can profoundly reshape perceptions of ageing and dementia, transcending perception barriers. The “Healing Light Exhibition,” held at the Palette Art Space in Bangkok from December 7th to December 18th, 2023, provided a platform for meaningful dialogue among diverse participants, including medical professionals, informal caregivers, artists, and students. This exhibition served as a focal point for an exploratory study aiming to examine the role of art and awareness by using cyanotype to explore Thai content. Employing autoethnography as a research approach, this study explored personal experiences to gain insights into broader cultural phenomena. Field notes and sketches were analysed thematically to uncover novel perspectives on dementia and palliative care. The healing light exhibition centred on discussions about dementia and palliative care, highlighting individual perspectives and societal constructs of self-identity. Often overlooked in dementia care design are art’s emotional and therapeutic dimensions, as designers and architects tend to prioritise physical aspects. Consequently, a gap exists between the needs of people with dementia and existing norms. Recommendations should explore various art mediums, contents, and environments to conduct therapeutic engagement, which can increase public awareness. Additionally, future research should gauge and measure the long-term impact and efficacy of innovative arts-based approaches in palliative care in Thailand.

 The personal transformation of the caregiver through EoL care was consisted of the diverse changes such as self-reflection and reinforcement of values, based on experiences with people around her in her life. It can be said that the creation of diverse places and networks where bereaved members can connect at the right time and demonstrate their compassion is important for the spread of CCs in the future.

 Gentle Death Education and Planning, Australia As the need for increased death literacy (Noonan 2016) increases globally, in tandem with an ageing population in much of the world, both assisted and unassisted deaths are being held to standards of transparency and accountability in terms of quality of life at end of life. The Lancet Commistion report on the Value of Death (2022) offers a framework for considerations that point way forward for discussing and considering the notion of a ‘good death’, not only for the person at end of life, but also for their familes and friends. End of life doulas, non-medical support workers to the dying and their close, caring networks are uniquely positioned to enhance and improve both individual and community death literacy standards. As educators, advocates and witnesses to the preparations for end of life, active dying and (often) the immediate work of after-death body care, end of life doulas offer a compassionate presence and a well-informed, evidence-based approach to information transfer when discussing rights, options and choices at end of life. Obviously the concept of a ‘good’ death is highly individualised and deeply personal, and the better-informed and prepared an individual is, the higher the probability that a death that is as close to an individual’s wishes as possible will take place. Good planning, which is another aspect of end of life doula work in general terms, is also highly beneficial in ensuring that options for alternate decisions are well in hand, keeping stress and unnecessary anxiety at bay during a time that may otherwise be quite challenging for both the dying and their caregivers. A well-planned end of life, coupled with thorough conversations and time spent with the person both during their end of life and immediately following death, helps avoid complex and traumatic grief for those left after their person’s death, and end of life doulas are playing an increasing role in facitliating conversations with families and with communities. Based on original qualitative research with end of life doulas in four countries, the role of end of life doula, the position of death literacy for practitioners, and future directions for the field are considered with a focus on increasing both death and grief literacy in a variety of settings, including hospitals, hospices, and homes. Quotes from semi-structured interviews will be shared, casting an essential light on the work and future potential of this robust and growing international field. 
 
 
 
 A key remit of public health palliative care is to address inequalities at the end of life. However, little is known about the end-of-life experiences of intersectionally marginalised groups who experience multiple systems of power and oppression, such as racism, sexism and classism, simultaneously. A method proposed to support greater access and inclusion of such individuals in research is to have community researchers as part of the core research team. We define community researchers as individuals with similar social identities, heritage and location to the research participants of interest. However, how best to work with community researchers in the context of structural inequalities at the end of life remains poorly understood.

 Fasiuddin Khan Research Foundation, Bangladesh, People’s Republic of From the original group a cohort of 7 semi-educated respondents were selected, belonging to 7 different slums, for follow-up interviews with a WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. It was typical for patients to have several comorbidities. Anxiety, sadness, and depression were the most commonly reported psychological symptoms. Among the intensive intervention group, home-based palliative care had a significant impact on psycho-social and spiritual care, especially for family caregivers and neighbors. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Patients and family members, including friends are seen as the ‘unit of care’ in palliative care. Best care for the dying patient, therefore, is achieved by offering optimal support for physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering to all persons involved in these often highly distressing situations. This study is part of a large international cohort study within the EU-funded ‘iLIVE-project’.

 University of Vienna, Austria With our contribution we want to participate in the exchange of experiences from compassionate cities in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, D/A/CH). How can people at the end of life who live alone at home be well supported and cared for? How can people with forgetfulness and disorientation be helped to find their way around in everyday life? Who looks after those who are socially and economically disadvantaged or socially marginalised? How can we, how can society contribute to ensuring that marginalised groups are not forgotten? These are questions that lie at the interface between palliative care and community care. In order to address these questions, we have set up a network in the German-speaking world, departing from the Institute of Nursing Science at the University of Vienna. Together with the network, we have started a writing project focusing on the question: “Social participation - how to include >hard-to-reach< groups”? In this volume, the personal and professional experiences and expertise of the members of the network will each shed light on one or more specific aspects of the issue of social participation of hard-to-reach groups. Telling and sharing these with each other - also in writing - supports and promotes mutual understanding. The network has so far met 5 times online in half-day moderated networking workshops. A first meeting in person is planned for Fri 18 October 2024 in Vienna. The joint publication will be presented there and the further network process will be decided.

 Palliative Medicine, is a robust, competency based, accredited field of medicine whose very genesis was organic and gradually emergent just over the last 40 years. Despite the incredible contributions Palliative medicine has made to evidence based, person centred care for people approaching the end of life, attention to the community itself has often not been one if its pillars. In this unique presentation, an academic physician and focused practice professor of palliative medicine nearing the end of her career, will participate in a frank dialogue-interview style-with a social media based influencer in public health palliative care. Together they will identify both the conscious and often unconscious drivers that influenced a generation of palliative medicine clinicians. Uncomfortable realities of how doctors are socialized and trained will be identified and the real, albeit unintended consequences of evidence based biomedical training in healthcare will be named. This first person account will focus on the lived and learned experience of this leader in palliative care and how a mid/late career jolt enabled a humble pivot that helped reframe training and competencies in palliative medicine to “re-imbrace” community. Lessons learned and importantly, future directions will be highlighted.

 “De Kolibrie”, established in 2016, is literally an open house where people facing a chronic illness - as patients or in their immediate environment - can walk in to share their stories with a trained volunteer. They can also take part in a diverse range of activities based on positive health. Our goals are: - Increasing empowerment - Improving quality of life - Increasing their knowledge about their specific challenge - Supporting people in the acceptance process, coping with grief and loss - Improving health, grief and death literacy - Preparing for and learning to cope with the last phase of life and its impact on day-to-day life We believe it is important that everyone can enjoy “De Kolibrie” regardless of their financial means, so we provide our activities free of charge. Donations and free contributions are the only source of income to support our operation. We are therefore a purely volunteer organisation that receives no structural support. Our team dedicates itself voluntarily day after day for free. By partnering with other organisations we are expanding our impact and strengthening the network of support essential for the well-being of our community. 
 We offer a wide range of activities including - leif-sessions (leif is the abbreviation of End-of-Life Information Forum): intimate conversations in which individuals, couples or families - supported by leifcounsellors - can discuss, share and record their wishes and concerns around the end of life. - Sessions around grief counselling that go beyond individual support. Here, on the one hand, we have the set of 6 pre-structured workshops where we provide methodologies and the free groups. By offering group sessions, we try to create a platform where participants can support each other and make connections with others going through similar experiences. - Where appropriate, we involve family members, friends and neighbours in individual end-of-life support. In this way, we aim to strengthen the support network and try to create a warm environment where no one needs to be alone during this delicate stage of life. 
 About 2,700 visits per year Approximately unique 310 visitors per year, with our guests being referred by doctors, other local health partners and word-of-mouth Positive results on satisfaction surveys Our numbers prove that initiatives like ours are much needed and add value within local communities. 
 
 Target audience: We connected through shared experiences of partnering with, and learning from, different populations in how people and communities want to be seen and cared for, elements that are often lost in a quest for palliative care specialization and standardization. We found mutual connection in understanding our role as guests, witnesses and learners, not experts and teachers, to illness suffering and caring. We hold a common ambition to center compassion and humility in caring and research practice. 
 Provide a forum for sharing stories, perspectives, and lessons on connection, compassion and humility in palliative care practice and research across diverse communities and populations. Use a design science approach to extract explicit principles from implicit knowledge and experience, to build and develop consensus around a Humility Reflection Guidance amongst workshop participants. 
 Presentations on palliative care across marginalized populations and diverse settings, with researcher perspectives on what we have learned, how we have been personally changed by the people and communities with whom we have worked, and the common threads across our work. Description of the design process to draft a Humility Reflection Guidance. Facilitated group discussion using a design science approach to build consensus on a Humility Reflection Guidance. After the conference, we will finalize and share the guidance with participants for review, with a plan for wider dissemination of our conclusions. 
 
 
 
 Edgewood College, United States of America The notion of ambiguous loss is anchored in Pauline Boss’s family experience of immigration to the United States in 1929. In her theory, she notes there are two types of ambiguous loss: where there is a physical absence with psychological presence (such as a person who has been “disappeared”), and where there is a psychological absence with physical presence (such as dementia). This presentation will focus on the first type of ambiguous loss where there is physical absence with psychological presence: the physical loss of someone that may remain unverified and may be without resolution, but for which memories can serve as a psychological presence of the missing individual. The role of secondary losses, such as communities, patriotic identity, and assumptive world, will be considered. Over 89 million people have been forcibly displaced as of 2021, including 36.5 million below age 18. All share a struggle with ambiguous grief and loss that is just beginning to be studied. For refugees, ambiguous loss is often characterized by hopes for refuge, longing for the past, and an endless sense of loss. This presentation will examine what one example of forced displacement looked like, and how refugee experiences can be conceptualized. It will then turn to the stories of refugees, in particular Sudanese youth living in Michigan known as the Lost Boys, and their ways of coping with the ambiguous loss of living apart from families and culture. To survive and thrive, these youth drew on relationships with peers, the presence of elders as a created surrogate family structure, and the psychological presence of their parents through remembering life lessons. Finally, tips for supporting refugee families will be discussed. 
 
 Abalone Consulting, United Kingdom The Lancet Commission on the Value of Death (2022) set out 5 principles and many recommendations to improve people’s experiences of dying/grief through major cultural and system change. However, this will only become reality if people in local communities engage with these ideas and develop their own locally-based actions. This project is to test a series of workshops using participatory and creative methods to introduce the Lancet Commission concepts to community participants with no prior specialist knowledge, in ways that can stimulate ideas for change and community action. The project uses a Participatory Action Research approach, with place-based participant sourcing in a city in Southern England. A range of methods are being used with intention to create accessible, enjoyable ways for participants to engage with Lancet Commission concepts, including: Short expert videos to introduce the 5 principles of a Realistic Utopia and stimulate response Facilitated conversations Collective collaging to explore structural determinants of death, dying and grief Stone-painting, placement and (re)arrangement to explore death systems Nature connection ‘If.. Then.. And’ statements Facilitated action-planning Further workshops are planned March–July 2024 and will continue to experiment with such methods to enable people to collaboratively explore these topics, community action and social change. Some deliberative methods may be used. Participants in the first workshop (December 2023) reported it as ‘thought-provoking’, ‘moving’, ‘stimulating’ ‘informative’ and ‘essential’. The use of short expert videos to introduce key Lancet Commission concepts was effective and elicited active discussion. Participants’ responses and creative outputs demonstrated that they had understood concepts including social determinants and dying as a relational and spiritual process, and had actively engaged in consideration of what could be different and how change might be achieved. Several expressed desire for further workshops to learn more and enable deeper exploration and to be involved in place-based change. Creative and participatory methods are effective in communicating key concepts from the Lancet Commission on the Value of Death to community participants who lack prior knowledge of these issues. Community workshops are an effective method of engagement, and have potential to catalyse involvement in community action and system change to implement the Lancet Commission ideas.

 Koordinierungsstelle für Hospiz- und Palliativversorgung in Deutschland, Germany The Charter process from 2008 to 2016 significantly advanced the further development of hospice and palliative care in Germany on the basis of the 5 Charter key principles. The participation of over 50 institutions and organizations relevant to society and health policy in the consensus process underlines the importance of the goals of the Charter and the recommendations for action adopted by consensus. In particular, Key Principle 1 of the Charter emphasizes social responsibility and the necessary solidarity of fellow human beings when accompanying the dying. On this basis, the aim is to spread the topics of dying, death and mourning across society and thus (re)integrate them into the context of people’s lives in Germany. The aim of the further implementation of the charter is therefore to promote the development of caring communities (this also includes compassionate communities) in the spirit of the Charter for the Care of the critically Ill and the Dying in Germany in order to promote the (further) development of what is, above all, an institution-and professional-centered care at the end of life to a community-oriented (re)care culture in Germany, to strengthen citizens in dealing with the topics of dying, death and grief and to promote their skills. Based on a qualitative nationwide inventory of the ongoing and completed (pilot) projects, two expert groups will be set up to support the development of sustainable caring community structures in Germany. One group is developing a workshop concept to support initiatives in establishing and expanding network structures around the topics of dying, death and grief. The other group develops recommendations for action in order to provide information on the launch and further procedure of corresponding initiatives. Caring communities in the sense of the charter arise where professional actors in hospice and palliative care work together with civil society, private sector and political actors and work together to ensure the conditions for a dignified death for all local citizens and mutual care. The charter process can be linked here. The Charter Round Table has established itself as a suitable platform for joint work. Author: Anne-Susanna Dreßke Co-author: Dr. Birgit Weihrauch 
 
 Healthy End of Life Project (HELP) Ottawa, a community-based, participatory action research project which served as a pilot for a Canadian version of a similar research endeavor at LaTrobe University in Australia (Grindrod & Rumbold, 2016, 2018). Aligned with the work of Dr. Allan Kellehear (Kellehear, 2005, 2013, 2020, 2022) and the international Compassionate Communities movement, HELP Ottawa was funded by the Mach-Gaensslen Foundation of Canada, a private foundation, and sponsored by Compassionate Ottawa (a non-profit organization),and hosted at Carleton University. Over the course of the project (2019-2022), HELP Ottawa worked at four sites, Christ Church Bells Corners, Orleans United Church, and Centretown and South-East Ottawa Community Health Centre, conducting baseline research, building capacity in research and community development, and developing, implementing and evaluating project initiatives based on the research findings. Over forty initiatives were implemented across the four sites, and eight multimedia toolkits have been created, to support other sites in building their own site-specific initiatives. Building on the momentum established by HELP Ottawa, Tri-Council funding was received to support toolkit translation, knowledge mobilization, knowledge translation and capacity building through four community-site forums, and a community-wide Summit. The four forums will be tailored to each of the host sites and will include interactive presentations, experiential learning activities, and future planning. The Summit will engage a broader audience, including decision makers, to establish an Action Plan with the goal of building more compassionate responses to death, dying, grief, and loss in Ottawa. Each of the forums and the Summit will be open to the public and extend the knowledge mobilization beyond the community. Engaging with over 200 participants, from community members, site facilitators, site leaders, health and social service providers, graduate students, government representatives, and policy makers through four forums and a final Summit. Further, we expect a wider audience will engage with the translated toolkits online. Our hope is to empower communities to be part of end-of-life care.",[],2024-10-10,Palliative Care and Social Practice,STI
11467937,Hippocampal dopamine as a key regulator for learning deficits in Parkinson’s disease,,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with clinical symptoms of involuntary or uncontrollable movements such as tremors, rigidity, and incoordination. The learning deficit is largely overlooked in the past because it is generally less impaired in the early stages of PD than in Alzheimer’s disease. However, recent studies have shown a significant decline in learning in PD. In addition to a lower learning rate, PD patients require substantially more brain activity and neural networks during the learning task, indicating a reduced learning efficiency. Furthermore, memory deficits are also common in PD even without the presence of overt dementia (Aarsland et al., 2021). Given the increasing prevalence of PD worldwide and the fact that symptoms typically start out mild and get worse over time, research into the mechanism of learning deficits in PD is of great importance. One distinctive neuropathological hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). Most individuals with PD have lost 60–80 percent or more of their dopamine-producing cells in the SNc by the time symptoms manifest (Poewe et al., 2017). This decline in DA levels could severely impair the reward-prediction signal in the mesolimbic system and contribute to learning deficits. Another hallmark of PD is the degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), where neurons appear to co-release norepinephrine and dopamine and are involved in attention and reward learning (Zhang et al., 2023). Intriguingly, the hippocampus, a critical limbic structure for learning and memory, receives projections from both the midbrain and LC dopamine-releasing neurons. There is a significant reduction in hippocampal volume in PD compared to healthy controls in some imaging studies, but there is little evidence of alternation in volume, or neuronal/glial loss in the stereological study (Villar-Conde et al., 2021). Instead, the hippocampal changes in PD may occur at the synaptic level, the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, or relate to neurogenesis, affected by the altered dopaminergic modulation. Dopamine regulates reward learning, motivation, and movement. It has been long established that firing patterns in midbrain dopamine neurons parallel the computation of reward prediction error signals in machine learning, serving as a teaching signal. Specifically, dopamine neurons fire in response to novel stimuli or unexpected rewards. The firing rate ramps up when the reward is uncertain, soars when the reward exceeds expectations, and dips when the reward falls short of expectations (Schultz, 2016). As a result, degeneration in the dopaminergic system should have a major impact on the severity of learning deficits in PD. While motor symptoms are closely linked with the nigrostriatal pathway, especially in the early stage of the disease, other learning-related functions worsen with disease severity. The affected cognitive functions include generalization, feedback-based learning, new information organization, memory retrieval, task-switching, and attention. Dopamine achieves its modulatory effects on above mentioned learning and memory associated functions through the D1 and D2 receptors in the hippocampus. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) and LC primarily project to the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions, while the SNc primarily projects to the CA2 region where the pathological protein α-synuclein shows significant distribution. These structural-specific projections are believed to have distinct roles in modulation learning and memory consolidation. D1 receptors are densely detected in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and CA1, while D2 receptors are exclusively expressed in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus (Gangarossa et al., 2012). D1 receptor in the dentate gyrus is critical for controlling spike timing-dependent plasticity, serving as the basis of reward learning, whereas D1R knockout or D1R antagonist in the CA1 blocks the late phase of long-term potentiation, suggesting the synaptic plasticity is strongly dopamine-dependent. One major dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus originates from the midbrain. These dopaminergic terminals can be observed throughout the hippocampal CA1 region. A recent human study by Elliott et al. (2022) measured the structural connectivity between the midbrain and hippocampus using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed its correlation with reward learning and memory performance. Stronger structural connectivity between the two regions was associated with enhanced memory encoding in response to rewards, but not to neutral stimuli. The study suggests that the midbrain-hippocampus structural connectivity plays a selective role in reward-related learning and memory encoding. Midbrain dopaminergic innervation of the hippocampus is sufficient for aversive learning and spatial learning (Tsetsenis et al., 2022). In addition to new information detection via the functional loop of VTA dopamine neurons and hippocampus, hippocampus dopamine release from both SNc and VTA projections can facilitate long-term potentiation, and enhance learning and long-term memory. The two midbrain dopamine sources are involved in distinct psychological processes of instrumental learning. While SNc dopamine neurons support accurate, time-limited, action-specific learning that is rigid, VTA dopamine neurons infuse cues and associated actions with the motivational value that allows flexible and persistent reward seeking (Fraser et al., 2023). The other major dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus recently identified originates from LC, one of the first areas undergoing degeneration in PD (Paredes-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Dopamine released from the LC terminals in dorsal CA1 is required for spatial learning and contextual memory linking, but not memory formation. Dopaminergic innervation from the LC in the dentate gyrus has been implicated in reinforcement learning. DA from hippocampal LC terminals produces a grace period of memory persistence and ‘flashbulb-like’ memories for unrelated events (Duszkiewicz et al., 2019). Interestingly, all these dopamine actions in either dorsal CA1 or dentate gyrus are mediated through D1-like receptors. Therefore, the deterioration of major hippocampal dopamine sources can be one of the key factors for learning deficits in PD. First, midbrain dopaminergic fibers may tightly instruct learning by selectively targeting specific synapses or cell types in the hippocampus and mark significant events, degeneration of which impairs cue and value-based learning; Second, LC dopamine release terminals possibly result in non-selective, widespread modulatory effects, and degeneration of which weakens widespread alertness, spatial learning and memory linking in varied salient situations. It is in line with the physical and cognitive symptoms of PD that impair patients’ capacity to build an adaptive model for guiding future behavior. Another noteworthy aspect is that newborn neurons play an essential role in the learning and memory circuitry of the adult brain, while the hippocampus is one of the few brain areas that can continue to produce new neurons during adulthood. However, fewer neural progenitor cells, declined neuronal survival rate and impaired plasticity have been reported in the dentate gyrus of PD patients or PD animal models with SNc DA depletion. Although the exact cause of the significant hippocampal changes in PD is still elusive, it is most likely associated with the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. This is because DA also plays a crucial role in promoting neurogenesis and the proliferation of neural cells in the hippocampus (Ohira, 2020). It is still controversial how the dopamine signal is transduced in mediating the promoting effect of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Dopamine can induce neural precursor cell proliferation mediated by epidermal growth factor. Similarly, entacapone, a modulator of dopamine, improves hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. In addition, D1 receptor-dependent antidepressant treatment increases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Activation of D1-like receptor likely promotes the growth factor-mediated proliferation. The critical role of hippocampal dopamine in the learning process can also be demonstrated by conventional L-Dopa treatment, which improved PD patients’ recent memory, long-term verbal and visual memory that relies on the hippocampal function (Kulisevsky, 2000). Indeed, decreased dopamine levels in the hippocampus could accelerate the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, whereas L-Dopa could inhibit or even dissolve fibrils of α-synuclein. According to a pharmacological fMRI study, hippocampus BOLD signals were linked to L-Dopa’s effects on memory function in senior people with a loss of dopamine neurons during normal aging. Learning efficiency was similarly enhanced in normal subjects using L-Dopa in a dose-dependent manner. However, adverse effects during dopamine replacement therapy may lead to pathological gambling, compulsive drug use, punding, and worsened reversal learning, indicating the role of dopamine in maladaptive behaviors. While dopamine replacement therapy has been shown to alleviate learning deficits, there are some limitations and issues that need to be addressed. Given the importance of hippocampal dopamine in PD learning deficits, the following aspects merit attention in future research to develop more effective treatments. First, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal dopamine action on learning-related cognitive dysfunction during Parkinson’s disease progression. Analysis of changes in the human hippocampal proteome in PD can provide essential information. Given that Parkinson’s disease symptoms vary across different stages, it is imperative to determine how hippocampal dopamine exerts its modulatory role in the different stages, and what kind of tailored treatment should be adopted accordingly. Furthermore, the effect of hippocampal dopamine on learning may depend on the source, timing, and receptor subtype of dopamine signaling, minimizing the side effects of dopamine therapy is a crucial challenge. Additionally, dopamine therapy often fails to produce the desired therapeutic effects in the late phase of Parkinson’s disease, and thus, further research is required to explore potential solutions for improving the efficacy of the treatment. Second, further studies are required to effectively and accurately mimic dopamine’s physiological function in the hippocampus using exogenous drugs. Spike-dependent phasic dopamine release represents a go signal caused by a salient external stimulus that mediates learning, while tonic dopamine release represents a no-go signal. Thus, the current dopamine therapy by providing dopamine precursor to alleviate PD motor symptoms is probably unable to mimic the delicate dopamine functions in the hippocampus, such as reward prediction error, and go/no-go signals. In addition, learning deficits in PD may vary with the timescale of hippocampal dopamine effects in different forms of learning and in different contexts. Although current optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations are powerful tools to identify key dopamine neural circuits that are causally related to learning-related behavior, dopamine release in the hippocampus induced by these manipulations could be quite different from the physiological level. Hence, it is critical to explore innovative methods for treating the learning deficits in PD that can precisely manipulate dopamine levels in the hippocampus and sensitively respond to physiological functions. Last, various neurotransmitters in the hippocampus are also involved in the dopamine regulation of learning. It is not clear how hippocampal dopamine dysfunction in PD patients affects its interaction with other transmitter systems. For example, dopamine release from the LC projecting to the hippocampus is likely to coordinate learning memory function in conjunction with norepinephrine. It is a significant challenge for future research to clarify the mechanisms by which complex synergies among multiple neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus that cause learning deficits in PD patients. In conclusion, hippocampal dopamine serves as a key regulator for learning capacity. The deterioration of major hippocampal dopamine sources in PD plays a crucial role in learning deficits and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Future research needs to focus on how to accurately mimic the physiological function of dopamine and the interaction of neurotransmitter systems during disease progression.",[],2023-9-22,Neural Regeneration Research,STI
11467660,"Harnessing science, technology, and innovation to drive synergy between climate goals and the SDGs",,"The United Nations passed two important resolutions, Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, in 2015 to change our world. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted as the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the goals. The overarching goal of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Science, technology, and innovation (STI) is one of the most prominent strategies promoted to aid SDG implementation. In this editorial, we provide specific mechanisms and strategies for STI to jointly promote climate change goals and SDGs. At the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world is lagging far behind the expected progress, triggered by and reinforcing poverty, inequality, hunger, disease, conflict, and disaster. Compared to 2019, countries have made little progress, and the world is still going in the wrong direction for food security, climate action, and biodiversity protection. Global GHG concentrations continue to rise, leading to record-breaking high global average temperatures. This trend increases the frequency of extreme weather events and accelerates the melting of glaciers and ice caps, causing rising sea levels and posing a threat to biodiversity. Human activities, principally through emissions of GHG, are responsible for global warming. Human development leads to rapid climate change, which in turn undermines human development. Climate goals and human development are interlinked. The SDG 13 that advocates for climate action is fundamentally consistent with climate goals. The status quo in development will bring about a climate and environment crisis, whereas focusing only on the climate goals and impeding development will bring about economic and social crises. The goal of sustainable development is to achieve both climate goals and SDGs. So, how can we meet this challenge and find the opportunity to achieve the two goals simultaneously? Climate change influences several SDG targets, but most of the interactions are synergies rather than trade-offs. Also, the trade-offs tend to be weaker than the synergies. Among the SDG targets that have trade-off relationships with climate goals, only four have evident trade-off interlinkages. To achieve the goals and targets, the 2023 Global Sustainable Development Report suggests deploying five “levers” to bring about transformation: governance, economy and finance, science and technology, individual and collective action, and capacity building. Paths for synergy between climate goals and SDGs Four curves with arrows represent the proposed paths for synergy. The current state is off track in both climate goals and SDGs. The ideal condition is that we can achieve both goals with the help of STI. If we only achieve one of the goals, we may face crises in society, economy, or environment. Developing efficient, zero-emission, and low-cost new energy and equipment is the key to achieving this synergy. The widespread use of fossil fuels is mainly due to their stability, reliability, and low cost. If the costs of new energy generation, with the help of STI and governmental initiatives, can be lower than traditional fossil fuels and are stable and reliable, then this will voluntarily drive manufacturing and consumer enterprises to switch to the new energy sources while simultaneously reducing industrial and economic development costs (SDG 12). At the same time, the production and maintenance of new energy equipment provide a large number of employment opportunities, and since the potential of solar and wind energy is highest in relatively remote areas, this would greatly promote poverty reduction (SDG 1). Fossil fuels are not only the main source of GHG emissions but also an important source of air, solid waste, and water pollution. Therefore, emission reduction has a natural synergistic effect with water pollution (target 6.3), air pollution (target 11.6), and soil pollution (target 12.4) reduction. The government can play a coordinating role by providing data support through STI, formulating efficient and consistent policies, and reducing the financial and social costs of implementing emissions reduction and pollution reduction separately. An example of synergy is the implementation of stringent air pollution control and GHG mitigation measures that could result in 40% of the global population being exposed to particulate matter levels below the air quality guideline set by the World Health Organization (WHO), with notable improvements in China, India, and the Middle East. Forests and grasslands on land, submerged plants in lakes, and mangroves, seaweed, and algae in the ocean all have ecological carbon sequestration capabilities, which can effectively reduce GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. At the same time, these areas are also the most diverse in terms of biodiversity. Therefore, the protection of these areas is essential. For example, some countries have already made afforestation plans for carbon sequestration in place around the globe. On one hand, there is an urgent need for scientific and technological advancements, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to provide more accurate early warning of disasters. On the other hand, when constructing new infrastructure or upgrading existing urban (SDG 11), agricultural (SDG 2), water conservancy (SDG 6), health (SDG 3), and other infrastructures, climate change factors should be fully considered. Moreover, due deliberation should be accorded to the potential occurrence of stronger natural disasters and warmer environments in the future. A few good examples to follow will be increasing the capacity of the sewage systems to cope with much higher flows (in the event of flooding), implementing technologies to cope with water scarcity like desalination and water treatment and reuse, etc. In addition to synergies between different goals, scientists, engineers, government administrators, financial investors, and all citizens also need to work together to reach synergism. The time left to combat the challenge of rapid climate change and its destructive impact on human development is limited. Whether one is optimistic or pessimistic, the most important thing is for us to accept the scientific facts, strive to stop climate change and achieve the SDGs through scientific and implementable methods, and be fully prepared to actively respond to the challenges of climate change in the short to medium term.

11467606,Assessing the Utility of a Patient-Facing Diagnostic Tool Among Individuals With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Focus Group Study,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and tissue fragility, is thought to be the most common inherited connective tissue disorder, with millions affected worldwide. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge that can impact quality of life for individuals with hEDS. Many with hEDS describe extended diagnostic odysseys involving exorbitant time and monetary investment. This delay is due to the complexity of diagnosis, symptom overlap with other conditions, and limited access to providers. Many primary care providers are unfamiliar with hEDS, compounded by genetics clinics that do not accept referrals for hEDS evaluation and long waits for genetics clinics that do evaluate for hEDS, leaving patients without sufficient options. This study explored the user experience, quality, and utility of a prototype of a patient-facing diagnostic tool intended to support clinician diagnosis for individuals with symptoms of hEDS. The questions included within the prototype are aligned with the 2017 international classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This study explored how this tool may help patients communicate information about hEDS to their physicians, influencing the diagnosis of hEDS and affecting patient experience. Participants clinically diagnosed with hEDS were recruited from either a medical center or private groups on a social media platform. Interested participants provided verbal consent, completed questionnaires about their diagnosis, and were invited to join an internet-based focus group to share their thoughts and opinions on a diagnostic tool prototype. Participants were invited to complete the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate their experience viewing the diagnostic tool. The MARS is a framework for evaluating mobile health apps across 4 dimensions: engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality. Qualitative data were analyzed using affinity mapping to organize information and inductively create themes that were categorized within the MARS framework dimensions to help identify strengths and weaknesses of the diagnostic tool prototype. In total, 15 individuals participated in the internet-based focus groups; 3 (20%) completed the MARS. Through affinity diagramming, 2 main categories of responses were identified, including responses related to the user interface and responses related to the application of the tool. Each category included several themes and subthemes that mapped well to the 4 MARS dimensions. The analysis showed that the tool held value and utility among the participants diagnosed with hEDS. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool stood out as a strength for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. The results provide insights on the perceived utility and value of the tool, including preferred phrasing, layout and design preferences, and tool accessibility. The participants expressed that the tool may improve the hEDS diagnostic odyssey and help educate providers about the diagnostic process.","Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of inherited disorders of connective tissue that result from impaired collagen synthesis throughout the body [ Descriptions of manifestations of EDS, including lax joints and skin findings, date back hundreds of years [ Historically, hEDS has been considered a rare condition, but there is more recent evidence suggesting that it is substantially more prevalent [ In addition to the inherent complexity of diagnosing a disorder with multisystem involvement and nonspecific symptoms (eg, chronic pain and fatigue), there are provider-related barriers to diagnosis for individuals with hEDS [ Limited accessibility to genetics specialists has, in some cases, resulted in genetics clinics declining to see patients referred for an hEDS evaluation [ Consultations with and referral to providers inexperienced with assessing for genetic forms of connective tissue disease are another barrier to a prompt and accurate diagnosis of hEDS [ Several web-based tools that assist in the diagnostic process have been developed in the genetic or rare disease domain [ Patient-facing diagnostic tools have potential to simplify and accelerate the diagnostic journey by raising awareness about the condition and diagnostic process. This could lead to more timely initiation of proper management strategies and improved patient outcomes. Evidence to support this comes from Lee et al [ The robust use of electronic health records, patient portals, and health-related websites has dramatically increased the amount and types of resources available to the public regarding their health. However, use of such digital tools comes with data security risks, and many health care applications do not meet privacy and security requirements [ Human-centered design (HCD) and design thinking are methods of innovation that focus on the needs of the human being, or the user or patient, to develop solutions to problems. HCD and design thinking use a variety of tools and methods to understand the problem being experienced by the person or population; identify possible solutions to those problems; and iteratively prototype, test, and refine those solutions [ The widespread use of smartphones has led to considerable growth in the development of mHealth apps. Consequently, several mHealth app evaluation frameworks have emerged to help patients and clinicians choose the most suitable and reliable app for their intended use [ Individuals with hEDS experience several different physical and somatic symptoms that substantially reduce their health-related quality of life [ Participants were recruited through two avenues: (1) private Facebook groups and (2) a clinical database of patients referred and evaluated for various pediatric and adult-onset genetics conditions, including hEDS, maintained at Geisinger Medical Center Department of Genetics and Genomics. This purposive sampling method was used to capture more diversity and include individuals both inside and outside the Geisinger service area. Geisinger is a large, integrated community-based health system that serves central, south central, and northeast Pennsylvania with robust medical and research genetics programs. It serves a large rural and stable patient population [ A social media post advertising the study opportunity was posted by a study team member (JG) on the EDS Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes Health Advocacy Program private Facebook group and the Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos or Chiari Support Group for Central PA private Facebook group. In total, 2 postings were made on each Facebook group spaced approximately 3 weeks apart. The post provided the email address of JG so that anyone who viewed the advertisement and was interested could receive additional information. A total of 10 individuals who viewed the Facebook post requested additional study information. In addition, participants were identified for the study through Geisinger’s Department of Genetics and Genomics clinical database. A patient list was exported from the database of patients seen in the clinic between September 2019 and September 2021 who were evaluated for hEDS. Patients were excluded from the research if, after chart review, they did not meet the criteria for hEDS following a clinical genetics evaluation. Eligible patients were contacted by study personnel up to 3 times either by telephone or through a patient message on the Geisinger patient portal during a 3-week recruitment period. A telephone script or advertisement were used to introduce the study. Those interested in learning more were sent additional information through encrypted email or the secure patient portal. A total of 12 patients from Geisinger expressed interest and requested additional study information. All participants were required to have a clinical diagnosis of hEDS, be aged ≥18 years, and read and speak fluent English. Study staff privately emailed information about the hEDS diagnostic prototype tool, the goals of the study, a demographic questionnaire, and a questionnaire asking about the diagnostic experience to those who enrolled in the study. Participants were offered 3 focus group times; 2 were offered in the evening and 1 was offered at midday. Recruitment ended after holding 2 focus groups, when theoretical sufficiency was achieved and the authors thought that there was enough breadth and depth of participant data to effectively address the research objectives [ The study was waived as human participant research by both the Geisinger and Sarah Lawrence College institutional review boards (IRBs). All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2000. Informed consent was obtained from participants using a written consent letter approved by the IRB (Geisinger IRB 2021-0394), which specified that return of the demographic questionnaire implied consent. The research protocol and all study materials, scripts, and advertisements were reviewed by the Geisinger IRB and determined to meet criteria for exemption as defined under category 2 in the US Department of Health and Human Services regulations for the protection of human participants in research. As such, no formal informed consent process was required. However, all participants were provided with an information form regarding the research and were asked to indicate whether they understood that no identifying or contact information would be shared outside of the research team, that participation was voluntary, and that all research data would be kept anonymous and private. No compensation was offered to participants. All participants were asked to agree to keep the focus group discussions private and not share what was discussed after leaving the focus group. To protect the privacy of research participants, all study-related data were deidentified and assigned a unique research identifier, and all survey responses were anonymous. The focus groups were conducted by 3 or 4 members of the study team, with one member facilitating the internet-based virtual focus group (VFG), another documenting during a brainstorming exercise, and the remaining study team members taking notes and monitoring the chat. All study team members were female. In total, 2 were genetic counseling graduate students (AK and NL) at the time of the study, one was a population health sciences researcher (KR), and one was a senior research genetic counselor (JG) with a clinical interest in EDS and a history of helping establish an hEDS specialty genetics clinic at her workplace. The latter 2 team members had extensive previous experience with qualitative research and trained the student members of the research team. Study team members had no previous relationship with the participants before this study. We conducted 2 VFGs using the Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Corp) videoconference platform. To ensure privacy, a link was sent to participants individually, and participants were asked to join from a private area. Study team members participated from a private room in their homes. Participants were admitted from the Microsoft Teams waiting room into the VFG, were asked to share only first names, and had the option to have their web camera on or off. A total of 8 participants attended the first VFG, which lasted 1 hour and 28 minutes. A total of 62% (5/8) of the participants opted to have their camera on during this focus group session. In total, 7 participants attended the second VFG, which lasted 1 hour and 32 minutes. Of these 7 participants, 4 (57%) opted to have their camera on during this session. One participant had audiovisual complications and used the chat feature to share all feedback. At the start of the VFG, ground rules were reviewed (eg, privacy of the discussion, respect for fellow attendees, and turn taking or participation), and a member of the study team announced that recording of the VFG would begin (using the Microsoft Teams recording feature). Participants were asked to share their motivation to take part in the study. A script akin to an interview guide developed by the research team was used to guide discussion on aspects of the usability, usefulness, and acceptability of the tool and began with a demonstration of the tool via the screen sharing feature. The VFG leader (JG) presented a hypothetical individual with some symptoms of hEDS and walked the participants through how the individual answered the questions within the tool by showing wireframes of the tool prototype. After the demonstration, the Rose, Thorn, Bud design thinking method was used to assess participant reactions to the tool [ In addition to discussion, participants used the chat feature and were invited to include additional thoughts in a postinterview survey via an anonymous web-based form. Verbatim transcripts were created from the Microsoft Teams recording. Transcripts, chat logs, and postinterview surveys from VFGs were reviewed, deidentified, and given a study ID. Transcripts and surveys were reviewed for additional roses, thorns, and buds and other remarks that were missed during the VFGs. These new ideas were also color coded based on “rose, thorn, bud” status to stay organized and added as sticky notes to the Miro board. Notes and focus group recordings were stored on Geisinger’s secure Microsoft Teams portal. Participants who attended the VFGs were privately recontacted via email and invited to complete the MARS. Those who expressed interest were emailed a PDF of the MARS, a PDF document that contained all questions used on the diagnostic tool, screenshots of the landing page ( The landing page for the prototype of a patient-facing digital tool to facilitate diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is shown in this figure. It includes a disclaimer, the expected time needed to complete the tool, what will be needed to complete the tool, who the tool is intended for, and what the tool will produce. Using a phenomenological approach, data analysis involved qualitative content analysis using affinity mapping to create a visual codebook used to code the transcripts. Content analysis allowed for reduction of concepts into key categories [ Note taking and data clustering into categories based on affinity occurred in two steps: (1) in real time as a member of our research team (KMR) typed web-based sticky notes during the VFGs and (2) after the VFGs, when brainstorming by writing down ideas extrapolated from transcripts, recordings, chat history, and postinterview surveys on web-based sticky notes. Next, the study team met to review the notes from the Miro board and discussed which notes shared similar themes and should be grouped together. Ongoing discussion with team members was vital to clarify and talk through conflicts regarding how the notes should be grouped and how to name the themes and subthemes. As 2 authors had personal experience with (potential) EDS diagnoses within their families and felt that patient education needs to be enhanced, reflexivity was practiced ensuring that the interpretation of the data remained objective and true to the experiences and shared thoughts of the participants [ The flow of the affinity mapping process that was used in this study starting from ideas shared during focus groups and ending with qualitative coding of focus group transcripts. VFG: virtual focus group. To visualize what changes and improvements were of highest priority to address for the diagnostic tool, a 2 × 2 prioritization grid was developed in Miro with the x-axis as lift (how much work the change will take) and the y-axis as importance (how many times this was mentioned in the focus group). Finally, the themes and subthemes were mapped to the MARS dimensions of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information to facilitate understanding of the qualitative data. Regarding quantitative data, respondents returned the MARS survey, and a member of the study team (JG) scored each one. The MARS total mean score was calculated to ascertain the overall quality of the diagnostic tool, and subscale scores were calculated and compared across participants to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the prototype. A total of 16 people agreed to participate in the VFGs; 1 (6%) was a no-show. Of the 15 participants, 13 (87%) completed the pre–focus group questionnaires, 13 (87%) self-identified as White and non-Hispanic, 12 (80%) identified as female, and 1 (7%) identified as male. This aligns with studies that note an excess of affected female individuals [ Reported demographics and diagnostic experience of participants with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) who took part in focus groups intended to capture their thoughts about and responses to a prototype of an hEDS diagnostic tool (N=15) Two main categories of responses to the tool prototype became apparent through the affinity diagramming process: (1) responses related to the user interface and (2) responses related to the application of the tool. These categories each include several themes and subthemes, which were mapped to 1 of the 4 dimensions or MARS subscales (esthetics, functionality, engagement, and information) assessed using the MARS evaluation framework.  Categories, themes, and subthemes identified through affinity mapping and mapped to corresponding Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) dimensions, which was used as a framework to determine whether the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome diagnosis tool prototype addresses the needs and goals for which it was created and highlight specific strengths and weaknesses of the app The MARS defines esthetics as “graphic design, overall visual appeal, color scheme, and stylistic consistency” [ “Tool design” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the esthetics” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) The MARS defines functionality as “app functioning, easy to learn, navigation, flow logics and gestural design of app” [ “Phrasing” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the functionality dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) “Communication with providers” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the functionality dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) Regarding the “Accessing the tool” theme, 2 subthemes were identified that mapped to the functionality dimension on the MARS:  The  The MARS defines engagement as “fun, interesting, customizable, interactive, well-targeted to the audience” [ “Diversity and inclusion” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the engagement” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) The MARS defines information as “high quality information from a credible source” [ “Diagnostic process” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the information” dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) “Results” subthemes, summary of participant comments, and specific quotes mapping to the information dimension on the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) Of the 15 VFG participants who were invited to complete the MARS, 3 (20%) returned the rating scale for scoring. The scores for each dimension per participant are shown in  The scores the participants provided for each dimension of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS)—mean scores (could range from 1 to 5) of the engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality objective subscales and overall mean app quality score per participant App subjective quality scores reported by the 3 participants App-specific rating scale scores reported by the 3 participants At the beginning of both focus groups, each participant was invited to share their motivations to take part in the study. Although not part of our assessment of the tool, this yielded rich insights into the hEDS diagnostic experience. Many participants shared difficulties they faced in the process of being diagnosed. Their struggles motivated them to be involved in research to improve the diagnostic process for others and increase awareness. Some participants also mentioned that this study’s purpose aligned with their personal goals and values. On the topic of personal experience, participants discussed money spent, years to receive a diagnosis, and feeling invalidated by medical professionals. One participant shared that they had spent US $10,000 in a year for their diagnosis. Another shared that they were diagnosed after 20 years, during which they saw ≥200 physicians and spent approximately US $100,000. One mentioned that it took so long to receive a diagnosis that they wanted to help others so that they did not have to experience the same diagnostic odyssey. One participant shared that their diagnosis journey involved a “vicious game of connecting the dots for over 30 years.” Some participants voiced that they were sick of medical gaslighting, for example, being accused of being drug seeking or labeled as crazy, lazy, or stupid by medical professionals. One participant shared that they were adopted; the lack of family history made their diagnostic odyssey extremely frustrating and emotionally exhausting. Some participants discussed their personal goals and values and how that led them to joining the focus group. One participant shared that they took any opportunity to help the EDS or rare disease communities. Some mentioned that they were active in the EDS and disability communities and wanted to support research. Other participants were passionate about knowing the importance of good data and information in the hEDS community, as well as being involved in hEDS medical education. Increasing awareness of hEDS is one goal that was shared among participants. Participants mentioned that there needs to be more patient rights, more resources, and more EDS-specific practitioners. One participant shared that it is hard to be diagnosed and find resources to determine whether being diagnosed is worthwhile. Another shared that they were newly diagnosed and they wanted to be able to better inform their physicians about EDS. The need to educate providers about hEDS can feel uncomfortable; improving provider awareness motivated some to participate in this research. After reviewing transcripts from the VFGs, we were able to identify the strengths of the tool from the perspective of the hEDS patient community and understand the aspects of the tool that need to be readdressed. We learned that the concept of a patient-facing tool held value and utility among the participants and that the simple, chatbot-style format was acceptable and user-friendly. The VFG participants confirmed what is found in the literature regarding long diagnostic odysseys for patients with hEDS. Their stories and experiences clearly support the need for improved communication between individuals with hEDS and health care providers, specifically as they search for a diagnosis. Their responses suggest that this tool has the potential to address this issue, possibly saving users time, money, and energy spent during their diagnostic odysseys and motivating users of the tool to receive an accurate diagnosis. There were several insightful suggestions for areas of improvement. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool was seen as the most promising piece for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. Given that some participants were concerned that individuals with other forms of EDS may be misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed after using the diagnostic tool, listing key symptoms (eg, major diagnostic criteria) for other forms of EDS to flag potential differential diagnoses was highly endorsed. Several participants offered suggestions of symptoms to be included in a checklist to expand on both common hEDS comorbidities and on symptoms of other forms of EDS and connective tissue disease. Several participants also suggested including a comment section for adding other symptoms or information to augment communication between patients and providers. As individuals with hEDS often have many seemingly unrelated symptoms, this list could help providers and users alike keep track of symptoms. Participants also endorsed adding resource links to the ending summary sheet, which could help users educate themselves on hEDS. These important suggestions indicate that both empowering patients to communicate with their providers and educating providers about hEDS were seen as equally important for improving the diagnostic process. We envision being able to use these comments to expand what can be entered into a future app to include a section where users can record symptoms, comorbidities, and medications. In addition, current, authoritative resources can be linked within the app. Language regarding the exclusion of differential diagnoses, which was very important within our study cohort, can also be added. The participants’ responses during the VFGs suggested that there were some concerns about the ability of the tool to accurately flag individuals with hEDS. As the questions in the tool are based on the 2017 diagnostic criteria, some of these concerns might point to a larger issue with the diagnostic criteria themselves. In line with this concern, the Toronto GoodHope EDS Clinic conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of the 2017 diagnostic criteria [ The depth and diversity of suggestions on the user interface imply that this is an important component of the user’s experience with the tool. Word choice was a frequently mentioned area for improvement. Although the word choice for the questions on the tool was intended to be consistent with the 2017 diagnostic criteria yet adapted to be patient facing, participants had many suggestions for areas where the word choices were confusing and medical jargon could be clarified, making the tool more accessible to the general population. Recommendations for text-to-speech capability and the inclusion of alternate text describing images were also made. The language used regarding sex and gender was suggested to be updated and clarified. Asking for “sex assigned at birth” rather than “sex at birth” and including an option for “other” was one suggestion from participants to improve the precision and the inclusivity of the tool. This wording, in addition to rephrasing some other items, has already been incorporated ( This is an example of the first page of a multipage printable summary sheet that would be produced from answering the questions on the app. Users can opt to share it with their medical provider to facilitate discussion about their symptoms in relation to the diagnostic criteria for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Participants offered many suggestions for improvements to the images used in the tool. Showing degrees of variability and images comparing someone with hEDS versus someone without could add further clarification. Including images of more diverse bodies could also help ensure that users of all skin tones and body types could easily recognize manifestations of hEDS on their own bodies. This would ultimately improve the clarity and inclusivity of the tool and combat stereotypes of what individuals with hEDS look like. Another aspect of the user interface that drew comments involved the design and functionality of the tool. Although the chatbot format was seen as a positive attribute, it limits functionality. The participants suggested that a back button or skip logic could make the tool easier to use. Other aspects of design, such as colors and icons, were more controversial, and it is unlikely that any design choice will please all users. User feedback has been considered, and an app with more functionality and flexibility is planned. The participants’ responses on where to house the tool suggest that it would be best to have the tool available in many places both on the internet and in person. Advertising the tool via pamphlets or brochures in certain physicians’ offices was suggested during the VFGs. Housing the tool solely on the web, on the Ehlers-Danlos Society website specifically, for example, may limit the number of people who could benefit from it. As participants pointed out, many have limited access to the internet or spend little time on the web. For those who do spend time on the web, they might only find the tool on the EDS website if they are already familiar with EDS, limiting its usefulness. To ensure that the tool is widely accessible, participants suggested workshopping good search engine optimization terms and making the tool usable on both mobile and desktop. They also suggested having professional or medical society backing to add more validity and help ensure that providers would be receptive to users’ results. Scoring the returned MARS surveys indicated that the EDS diagnostic tool prototype was moderately highly to highly rated among our respondents, which echoed the qualitative analysis findings. App quality scores showed that the tool was easy to navigate, functioned well, and was moderately to highly visually appealing. This is consistent with qualitative data gathered from the VFGs, where most participants liked the easy flow and chatbot style of the tool and felt that the design was pleasing. On the basis of the items assessing engagement (eg, interactivity, interest, target group, customization, and entertainment), respondents were moderately engaged with the app. One participant noted within the engagement subscale that the app is not intended to be used for entertainment, and they rated it accordingly. Another respondent noted within this subscale that it is not necessary to customize this app for its intended use. As the diagnostic tool is not meant to entertain or be interactive, a moderate engagement score is not surprising. There were differences among survey respondents on the subscale assessing information quality, making it challenging to draw conclusions from the small cohort of respondents. This, in part, stemmed from a MARS item assessing where the app was developed (eg, an academic center or a company); this is not clear on the prototype, nor was it discussed in the VFGs. A future version of the tool would need to clearly indicate the developer. Another question with divergent responses regarded whether the content of the app was well written. While 67% (2/3) of the respondents highly endorsed this item, 33% (1/3) of the respondents indicated that they did not like how some questions were addressed to the patient, whereas other questions were addressed to a provider. Although most questions in the EDS diagnostic tool were structured to be patient facing, the phrasing of a few items was kept as provider facing to be consistent with the published questionnaire by Hakim and Graham [ The MARS app subjective quality scores indicated that the tool had a high satisfaction rating, and respondents valued the tool enough to warrant recommending it to others. This reflects discussion during the IFGs where participants indicated they would be likely to recommend the tool to a friend with signs of EDS. Within the subjective quality subscale, when asked whether respondents would pay for the app, 67% (2/3) responded “no,” whereas 33% (1/3) responded “maybe.” On the item assessing repeated use of the app, a lower score was endorsed by most respondents, with 67% (2/3) noting that the tool is not intended for repeated use. The app subjective quality scores indicated that the respondents feel that others could benefit from the app but do not feel that they would pay for the app. This may reflect that the app is intended to be a 1-time use experience, and consumers may not feel that this warrants payment. In addition, during the VFGs, we discussed that the app was intended to be available on a website, such as the Ehlers-Danlos Society site, which may have led respondents to believe or feel that the tool should be free. The app-specific rating scale scores showed overwhelmingly that the respondents felt that the EDS diagnostic tool would likely increase the knowledge surrounding the diagnostic process for hEDS. Scores indicated that the tool would encourage users to continue to seek help to obtain a correct diagnosis. Most respondents felt that use of the tool would increase the likelihood of receiving an accurate diagnosis and would increase awareness of the importance of properly assessing for hEDS. Interestingly, when asked to rate whether the tool is likely to change attitudes toward improving the diagnostic process for hEDS, 67% (2/3) of the respondents highly endorsed this item, whereas 33% (1/3) noted that they were uncertain of whether a diagnostic tool or app can change the attitude of health care providers because some simply “don’t believe in” hEDS. Participants were recruited to this study because they had diagnoses of hEDS, although the sample is not representative of all individuals diagnosed with hEDS, especially given our homogeneous sample. This may affect how transferrable their responses are to a wider audience. Most participants also reported feeling generally comfortable reading health care materials, and some were part of advocacy groups or reported being highly involved in work surrounding hEDS. As such, our sample may be more informed on hEDS than the average user of the diagnostic tool and more inclined toward using a digital tool. Further testing is needed with a general-population user group. Focus groups are a group-based technique subject to group bias effect [ Regarding the MARS, technically, the scale is not intended for use on a static prototype, although we felt that using the MARS as a basis to improve the quality of a future EDS diagnostic tool was acceptable. In addition, because survey respondents were not trained on how to use the MARS, it is possible that respondents did not accurately or consistently rate items on the MARS. Finally, it could have been beneficial to have additional respondents to the MARS survey to ensure that the needs and goals for which the tool was created were on target and highlight additional strengths and weaknesses. Despite this, having qualitative data that assessed user experience from 2 VFGs likely allowed us to capture most themes surrounding the utility, feasibility, acceptability, and need for a diagnostic hEDS tool. According to a 2017 study, 80% of themes are discoverable within 2 to 3 focus groups, whereas 90% are discoverable within 3 to 6 focus groups [ Research is underway to identify the genetic etiology of hEDS. In the meantime, this study could lead to further research on current EDS diagnostic criteria and the need to enhance the diagnostic process. On a larger scale, further research is needed into barriers to care for individuals with hEDS and the impacts of this on quality of life. Finally, it is important to investigate whether patient-facing digital tools could be beneficial for individuals seeking diagnoses for other genetic or medical conditions that rely on clinical diagnoses and whether access to a diagnostic tool could improve accurate application of diagnostic criteria. For example, fibromyalgia may be an interesting candidate for a similar tool given the lack of objective markers and availability of diagnostic criteria [ Since the conclusion of this research, the prototype of the EDS diagnosis tool has been presented to the Ehlers-Danlos Society. Given the shared goal of improving the diagnosis of those with EDS, this has led to a collaboration. A project envisioned by the Ehlers-Danlos Society has been undertaken by some of the world’s leading experts on EDS to generate and publish the diagnostic pathways for the EDSs. An mHealth app similar but more extensive than the prototype used in this research is in the process of being developed to detail these diagnostic pathways in electronic form and will include both patient- and provider-facing sections. We are anticipating using React, which is an extensible, mature JavaScript, to build the user interface. In alignment with the desire voiced by participants in the VFGs to record their potential symptoms of EDS, the web-based tool will include a patient-centered section with a symptom diary, a medication reminder feature, and a social platform to allow for connections among users. Assessing the use of this diagnostic tool from the perspective of individuals diagnosed with hEDS has highlighted how it could be useful for individuals searching for an explanation for their potential hEDS-related symptoms. Suggestions and improvements were offered to optimize the tool before public release. Participants indicated that the tool may help individuals be diagnosed more easily, save time and money, help educate providers, and overall improve the diagnostic odyssey of hEDS. While they offered detailed suggestions for improvement, their overall feedback was positive and enthusiastic about the concept of the tool in general and expressed their desire to see it become available to patients. Recommended changes include altering the technical and visual design, incorporating more diverse language and images, and simplifying wording and medical terminology while consistently being patient facing. These suggestions will aid the process of finalizing a diagnostic tool and may, ultimately, help facilitate a diagnosis for individuals with hEDS.","['diagnostic tool', 'hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome', 'patient experiences', 'diagnostic odyssey', 'affinity mapping', 'mobile health app', 'mobile phone']",2024-9-26,JMIR Formative Research,STI
11467458,Dual-dispatch protocols and return of spontaneous circulation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a nationwide observational study,"The Korean National Fire Agency conducted a pilot project examining Advanced Life Support (ALS) protocols, including epinephrine administration, to improve survival among patients suffering out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the Korean National Fire Agency ALS protocol on prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with OHCA. This study included patients with adult-presumed cardiac arrest between January and December 2020. The main factor of interest was ambulance type according to ALS protocol, which was divided into dedicated ALS ambulance (DA), smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS), and non-DA, and the main analysis factor was prehospital ROSC. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. During the study period, a total of 18,031 adult patients with OHCA was treated by the emergency medical services, including 7,520 DAs (41.71%), 2,622 SALSs (14.54%), and 7,889 non-DAs (43.75%). The prehospital ROSC rate of the DA group (13.19%) was higher than those of the non-DA group (7.91%) and the SALS group (11.17%, P<0.01). Compared with that of the DA group, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for prehospital ROSC were 0.97 (0.82–1.15) in the SALS group and 0.57 (0.50–0.65) in the non-DA group. ALS protocol intervention was associated with prehospital ROSC rates. Therefore, continuous efforts to promote systemic implementation of the ALS protocol to improve OHCA outcomes are necessary.","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with low survival rates, and is a major public health problem [ In addition to rapid BLS [ These EMS resuscitation protocols can affect the rate and timing of resuscitation of patients with OHCA provided by EMS crews [ This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy (No. 2022-0048-001). The requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. An observational study was performed by the Korean National Fire Agency (NFA) using the OHCA registry. The NFA operates a single EMS system across the country, with 18 provincial offices targeting more than 50 million people in an area of 100,210 km There are three types of ALS-provided ambulances differentiated by protocols. The first type is a smartphone-based ALS ambulance (SALS). Since 2015, this protocol has been implemented in selected areas (four cities and provinces, 31 of 224 fire departments nationwide, covering 23.9% of the total population). The SALS protocol requires two ambulances and enables real-time feedback from EMS physicians using video calls as well as the use of a manual defibrillator and administration of ALS medications such as epinephrine and amiodarone [ The second type is a dedicated ALS ambulance (DA) consisting of two or more qualified EMS crews. This nationwide EMS intervention was initiated based on evidence that a better trained and experienced EMS crew can improve outcomes in patients with cardiac arrest [ The EMS crews in these DAs received 3 days of Advanced Cardiac Life Support training, enhancing their capability for handling complex emergencies. DA teams are dispatched with priority in cases of OHCA and are permitted to use epinephrine under direct medical oversight via video calls as part of a nationwide pilot project. When the dispatch center recognizes cardiac arrest, they dispatch the DA with priority, followed by another ambulance for a multitier response. Specifically, the DA protocol allows the initiation of AAM and epinephrine administration even in the absence of a second ambulance when a fire engine (acting as a BLS team) is on scene. This is a significant protocol advantage over SALS, which requires the presence of two ambulances for ALS interventions ( OHCA data were drawn from the NFA EMS system database in Korea, which includes EMS activity, cardiac arrest, and EMS dispatch center information. The details of this database have been reported in previous studies [ This study included patients with OHCA aged >18 years with a presumed cardiac etiology treated by EMS crews between January 2020 and December 2020. We included individuals irrespective of prehospital ALS. Patients who had not undergone resuscitation or were witnessed by the EMS crew and a single ambulance dispatch were excluded from the analysis. The primary analytical factor was prehospital ROSC that was maintained until hospital arrival. The secondary analysis factors were the rates of AAM, IV, and epinephrine administration, defined as ALS. The following variables were recorded: (1) demographic factors of age and sex; (2) community factors of season, metropolitan area (patients categorized based on residential location, including 10 metropolitan cities and nine provinces), place (public, private, and other), witnessed, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and defibrillation; and (3) EMS factors of response time interval (RTI; from the time of the call to the time when the first vehicle arrives at the site), scene time interval (STI; from the time the first vehicle arrives at the site to the time the patient transport vehicle leaves the site), transport time interval (from the time of departure from the site to the time of arrival at the patient transport vehicle hospital), field primary electrocardiogram (shockable [ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia], pulseless electrical activity, and asystole), prehospital airway management (bag valve mask, endotracheal intubation, and supraglottic airway), advanced airway timing (from arrival time at the site to success time of advanced airway), EMS defibrillation, IV and epinephrine administration, epinephrine administration timing (from arrival time at the site to time of epinephrine administration), and ROSC upon arrival at the emergency department. Statistical analysis was performed to determine differences among groups. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as median and quintile, and statistical tests were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationships between key variables and study results and to adjust for potential disturbance factors. Model I was adjusted for demographic factors (age and sex). Model II was adjusted for model I demographic factors, community factors (season, witness, cardiac arrest location, metropolitan area, and bystander CPR), RTI, STI, initial electrocardiogram rhythms, and epinephrine administration. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the key variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver. 5.2 (SAS Institute Inc). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Among 31,651 patients with OHCA treated by EMS between January and December 2020, 18,031 adult patients (56.97%) were included in the study. The number of patients transferred by group was 2,622 SALS, 7,520 DA, and 7,889 non-DA ( The median age was 74 years for SALS, 73 years for DA, and 74 years for non-DA (P=0.09). The DA group included the largest number of metropolitan residents (SALS, 18.31%; DA, 56.58%; and non-DA, 39.83%; P<0.01). Public places were the highest location of response in the non-DA group (SALS, 9.57%; DA, 10.25%; and non-DA, 11.81%; P<0.01). Witnessed cases were highest in the non-DA group (SALS, 44.77%; DA, 43.34%; and non-DA, 44.78%; P<0.01) and bystander CPR cases were highest in the SALS group (SALS, 69.45%; DA, 65.85%; and non-DA, 67.22%; P<0.01) ( Prehospital ROSC was the highest in the DA group (SALS, 11.17%; DA, 13.19%; and non-DA, 7.91%; P<0.01). In multivariable logistic regression model Ⅰ after adjusting for age and sex, the SALS and non-DA groups were associated with lower prehospital ROSC compared with the DA group (SALS: aOR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72–0.96]; non-DA: aOR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.51–0.63]). In model II, after adjusting for all other confounders, there was no significant difference in the SALS group, and the non-DA group was associated with lower prehospital ROSC (SALS: aOR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.82–1.15]; non-DA: aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.50–0.65]) ( For ALS, in regression model Ⅰ, the SALS and non-DA groups were associated with lower provision of AAM (SALS: aOR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58–0.79]; non-DA: aOR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.62–0.78]), IV (SALS: aOR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.43–0.52]; non-DA: aOR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.38–0.43]), and epinephrine (SALS: aOR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46–0.55]; non-DA: aOR, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.08–0.10]) compared with the DA. In model Ⅱ, even after adjusting for all other confounders, the results were similar ( Regarding the prehospital ALS rate, the DA group provided AAM at a higher rate (SALS, 89.70%; DA, 92.75%; and non-DA, 89.91%; P<0.01), and the median (interquartile range, IQR) time interval from EMS arrival at the scene to the application of AAM was similar in the three groups (6 minutes). DA showed the highest provision rate of IV (SALS, 45.77%; DA, 63.88%; and non-DA, 41.65%) and epinephrine (SALS, 31.50%; DA, 47.77%; and non-DA, 7.40%) ( The cumulative rate of prehospital epinephrine at 60 minutes was the highest in the DA group (epinephrine timing, 19 minutes) followed by the SALS and non-DA groups (epinephrine timing, both 21 minutes) ( The DA group had a slightly faster RTI (7 minutes [IQR, 6–9 minutes]) than that of the SALS group (8 minutes [IQR, 7–11 minutes]) and the non-DA group (8 minutes [IQR, 6–11 minutes]). The DA group (17 minutes [IQR, 14–21 minutes]) and the SALS group (18 minutes [IQR, 14–22 minutes]) had a longer STI than that of the non-DA group (14 minutes [IQR, 12–18 minutes]; P<0.01). The rate of use of defibrillation was highest in DA (SALS, 19.72%; DA, 21.57%; non-DA, 20.18%; P=0.04) ( This nationwide observational study was conducted in Korea. When a DA is dispatched, there is a higher rate of prehospital ROSC and provision of prehospital ALS, such as AAM, IV, and epinephrine, than for other protocols. Depending on the nature and circumstances of EMS, benefits may vary as well as their effects on patient outcomes [ Early ALS response was associated with improved survival in a recent ALS study [ The strength of this observational study is that it investigated the effects of a new EMS protocol and operation implemented in Korea at the national level. To improve OHCA results, Korea has implemented interventions such as DA and EMS [ In our analysis, the DA group exhibited a higher rate of advanced AAM application compared to both SALS and non-DA groups. Notably, the time to administer AAM did not significantly differ across these groups, indicating that the efficiency of these EMS protocols is consistent across models. This suggests that EMS protocol implementation effectively standardizes care delivery without delaying interventions, showcasing its potential to enhance patient outcomes in OHCA scenarios ( When designing an EMS system, various considerations are needed to improve EMS quality. To improve prehospital ROSC and ALS rates, there is a need to increase performance skills and self-efficacy through appropriate staffing of EMS providers and systematic training. In addition, it is necessary to maintain the experience of ALS providers to improve higher-risk ALS capabilities. Therefore, the operation of a DA-type EMS for patients with OHCA with high dispatch frequency can be especially effective [ This study has several limitations. First, this was a natural experimental study rather than a randomized controlled trial [ In conclusion, ALS protocol interventions were associated with differences in prehospital ROSC rates. All societies should do their best to improve the survival of patients with cardiac arrest based on local characteristics.","['Advanced Cardiac Life Support', 'Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'Emergency medical services', 'Return of spontaneous circulation', 'Epinephrine']",2024-4-5,Clinical and Experimental Emergency Medicine,STI
11466795,Iron overload regulates cognitive function in rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy by inducing an increase in frontal butyrylcholinesterase activity,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of iron overload on acetylcholinesterase activity in the frontal lobe tissue of rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and its relation to cognitive ability. By elucidating the potential mechanisms of cognitive impairment, this study may offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for MHE. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased and randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group with six rats in each group. Following the induction of MHE, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) was utilized to assess spatial orientation and memory capacity. Subsequently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were performed to capture Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) images of all rats' heads. Compared to the control group rats, the MHE model rats showed significantly reduced learning and memory capabilities as well as spatial orientation abilities ( The changes in BuChE activity in frontal lobe extract may be related to changes in spatial orientation and behavioral changes in MHE, and iron overload in the frontal lobe tissue may regulate changes in BuChE activity, BuChE levels appear to be iron-dependent.","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication characterized by cognitive decline and abnormal neurologic function, with high prevalence worldwide (Bernal et al.,  Recent studies have linked defects in the brain neurotransmitter system, particularly glutamate and monoaminergic mechanisms, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin systems, to the occurrence of MHE in animal models and liver disease patients (Hamdani et al.,  The cholinergic system plays a crucial role in specific behavioral responses and cognitive processes (Berlot et al.,  Therefore, this study aims to explore potential changes in blood serum and brain tissue BuChE activity and its relationship with cognitive function under the background of MHE in model rats and determine whether BuChE activity changes are related to iron overload. We hypothesize that abnormal iron accumulation in the MHE brain region induces increased BuChE expression, which consumes the neurotransmitter ACh through a bypass pathway, thereby accelerating cognitive impairment in the MHE brain cholinergic system. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats (6–8 weeks, 200–260 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Ningxia Medical University. After 1 week of acclimation, the animals were randomly assigned to experimental ( The timeline for the entire experimental process. The Morris water maze (MWM) consists of a circular pool measuring 200.0 cm × 200.0 cm × 55.0 cm, filled with water to a depth of 37.0 cm with an escape platform located 2.0 cm below the water surface. The water temperature was maintained at 22 ± 2°C. To minimize external factors' potential confounding effects on the experimental animals, the pool was surrounded by canvas, whilst plastic boards with varying shapes were affixed to the walls in the east, south, west, and north directions to assist the rats in orientating themselves and determining their location. Place navigation test: The experiment consisted of 5 days, with four training sessions per day. At the start of each session, rats were introduced into the water from any point on the wall facing the pool. Their swimming trajectories and times were recorded using a SMART 3.0 computer video tracking system (Panlab, Spain). The average score of the four daily training sessions was used to evaluate the learning performance of the rats. Throughout the experiment, all rats had to locate and remain on the escape platform for 10 s within a 60-s timeframe. If the rat failed to reach the platform within 60 s, it was placed on the platform for 10 s before the next trial. Spatial exploration test: On the sixth day, the escape platform was removed, and all rats were allowed to swim freely in the MWM for 60 s. The SMART 3.0 computer video tracking system automatically recorded the behavioral indices of the rats in the maze (time spent in the target quadrant and number of times crossing the target quadrant), and the behavioral performance of all rats was observed. On the day of MRI data acquisition, isoflurane (induction 5%, maintenance 2%, oxygen flow rate 1.5 L/min) was utilized to anesthetize the rats. Subsequently, all rats underwent imaging using a GE Architect 3.0T MR scanner equipped with a dedicated rat coil. To prevent image quality degradation and motion artifacts caused by head movement during scanning, the tails and heads of the rats were secured using medical tape and sponge pads before the experiment. The rats' condition was continuously monitored throughout the scan. Before the QSM scans, routine sequence scans were performed to exclude rats with brain lesions. QSM data acquisition was performed using a 3D gradient-echo (GRE) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 100.4 ms/8 ms, flip angle = 12°, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, slice spacing = 1.0 mm, FOV = 80 × 80 mm. Data post-processing: The raw images were transferred to a personal computer in DICOM format using RadiAnt DICOM Viewer software ( The day after the QSM data acquisition, blood was drawn from the tail vein to assess the RBC count (BC-2800vet, Mindray, China). Rats were euthanized after blood collection, and frontal cortex and liver tissues were rapidly harvested on ice. Fix the frontal cortex and liver tissue with 4% paraformaldehyde, stain with iron, and quantify iron deposits using Eclipse Ci-L microscopy and Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Calculate iron deposition as the pixel area of iron ion precipitation/field of view pixel area  Subsequently, the tissue sample was subjected to a wash step with pre-chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH = 7.4) to eliminate residual blood content before being weighed. Next, physiological saline solution (0.9%) was added to the tissue sample at a predetermined weight-to-volume ratio of 1:9. Afterward, the sample underwent mechanical homogenization in an ice-cold water bath at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant containing the soluble components was collected for further experimentation as per the instructions stipulated by the manufacturer. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-26.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.5 software (GraphPad Software, USA). Prior to statistical testing, we assessed the normality of all data using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For normally distributed continuous variables, we employed the  We evaluated the temporal changes in spatial learning ability in all rats using the place navigation test. A statistically significant reduction in latency period (time to reach the original platform) was observed in the HC group as the number of training sessions increased, with a significant difference noted between the fourth and fifth days ( MWM latency time of rats in two groups. On the sixth day of the experiment, we conducted a spatial probe test to assess the rats' spatial orientation and memory abilities. We found that the MHE group had significantly fewer crossings than the HC group ( Spatial memory performance of HC and MHE groups.  We assessed BuChE activity in the serum and frontal lobe tissue of HC and MHE groups. Our results show that BuChE activity in the serum of MHE group was significantly lower than that of the HC group ( BuChE activity in the peripheral and central of HC and MHE groups.  The frontal lobe susceptibility values of HC and MHE groups.  Brown granules indicative of iron was visible in the MHE frontal cortex stained with DAB-enhanced Prussian blue ( DAB-enhanced Prussian blue staining of HC and MHE groups.  In the MHE group, we found a significant positive correlation ( Interrelationship of BuChE activity in serum and RBC count. To investigate the potential relationship between cognitive impairment and iron accumulation, we conducted a correlation analysis between the target quadrant stay time in spatial exploration test (on the sixth day) of HC and MHE groups with susceptibility values in the frontal cortex. Our results revealed a significant positive correlation between the susceptibility values and the latency period in the MHE group ( Correlation analysis was used to predict the relationship between spatial memory and susceptibility values of frontal cortex in all rats. Correlation analysis of  To evaluate the relationship between susceptibility and BuChE activity, we conducted a correlation analysis between these variables in the frontal cortex of HC and MHE groups. Our analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between susceptibility values and BuChE activity ( The correlation between the BuChE activity and susceptibility values of frontal cortex in all rats;  This study utilized QSM technology to evaluate alterations in iron content within the frontal lobe tissue of rats with MHE. Our findings revealed a significant increase in susceptibility values within the bilateral frontal lobe tissue of MHE group. Additionally, we observed a noteworthy enhancement in BuChE activity levels in the frontal cortex of MHE group, while BuChE activity within their serum significantly decreased. Further analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between susceptibility values and BuChE activity in the frontal cortex of MHE group. Furthermore, our research determined a positive correlation between BuChE activity in the peripheral blood of MHE rats and their RBC count. These results may provide insight into the underlying biological mechanisms associated with cognitive impairment in MHE and emphasize the potential role of iron overload in this disease. In this study, a murine model of MHE was established by utilizing TAA. Cognitive impairments such as deficits in memory, learning, and spatial orientation were evaluated in the MHE group through MWM testing. Due to its demonstrated accuracy in measuring memory and attention deficits (Singh and Trigun,  Iron is the most abundant metal in the human body and plays a critical role in numerous biological processes (Yang et al.,  Cholinergic neurons are primarily located in areas of the brain that are associated with cognitive function (Méndez et al.,  Our study results suggest that an imbalance in the cholinergic system related to cognitive function may represent a neuropathological characteristic of MHE, with liver failure-induced iron dyshomeostasis potentially playing a predominant role in this process. Elevated iron-dependent BuChE levels can accelerate the decay of ACh in the brain, leading to a deterioration of cognitive status in MHE patients. Previous research has demonstrated significant reductions in ACh content in specific brain regions in HE model rats (Garcia-Ayllon et al.,  In the context of liver failure, the disruption of iron homeostasis culminates in iron overload, which can trigger BuChE expression and accelerate the progression of MHE. Consequently, it is pertinent to investigate whether a combinatory therapeutic approach involving cholinesterase inhibitors and natural iron chelators like lactoferrin may represent a more efficacious treatment strategy for MHE. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between iron overload and BuChE in MHE. Our findings demonstrated that peripheral blood levels of BuChE were positively correlated with RBC count in MHE model rats. Iron overload may act as a modulator of changes in BuChE activity observed within the frontal lobe tissue of MHE model rats, while the alterations in BuChE activity detected within the frontal lobe extract may be associated with spatial orientation and behavioral changes relating to MHE. These discoveries have provided potential therapeutic targets for MHE treatment, augmenting our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MHE and providing new avenues for its clinical management.","['minimal hepatic encephalopathy', 'butyrylcholinesterase', 'quantitative susceptibility mapping', 'iron deposition', 'cognitive function']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,STI
11466375,"Risk of Clade II Mpox Associated with Intimate and Nonintimate Close Contact Among Men Who Have Sex with Men and Transgender Adults — United States, August 2022–July 2023",,"Monkeypox virus can spread through intimate or close contact with a person with mpox. Among men who have sex with men and transgender persons who reported close contact with a person with mpox, condomless receptive anal sex was associated with approximately five times the odds of mpox after controlling for mpox vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics, and concurrent close contact behaviors. The findings in this report underscore the importance of ongoing multifaceted mpox prevention activities, including mpox vaccination and education on safer sex practices, to reduce the spread of mpox. A global outbreak of clade II mpox associated with sexual contact, disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), has been ongoing since May 2022. Information on types of contact most associated with transmission is limited. This report used data from a multijurisdictional vaccine effectiveness case-control study of sexually active persons aged 18–49 years who identified as MSM or transgender, collected during August 2022–July 2023. Odds of mpox associated with selected types of intimate and nonintimate close contact with a person with mpox were estimated. Among 457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients who met minimum data requirements, 150 (32.8%) case-patients and 57 (5.5%) control patients reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Adjusted odds of mpox were 5.4 times as high among those who reported having condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox, compared with participants who reported close contact with a person with mpox and no condomless receptive anal sex with that person (OR = 5.4; p = 0.031). Although the mpox vaccine is highly effective, vaccination coverage remains low; a multifaceted approach to prevention remains important and should include vaccination promotion, safer sex practices, and increasing awareness that mpox continues to circulate. In May 2022, an unprecedented worldwide outbreak of clade II mpox, caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), was detected among persons in countries with no history of sustained community transmission. In the United States and worldwide, the ongoing outbreak has been associated with sexual contact, and has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) ( A secondary analysis was conducted using data previously collected for a vaccine effectiveness (VE) case-control study using patient self-reported survey data and jurisdiction-reported data from 12 U.S. jurisdictions ( Case- and control patients were eligible to participate if they were sexually active, The analytic sample was restricted to case- and control patients from the VE study who reported close contact with a person with mpox. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine the unadjusted and adjusted odds of select types of intimate and nonintimate contact and case- or control patient status. The unadjusted models examined demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender identity), a composite variable of HIV status and HIV PrEP or treatment (i.e., antiretroviral [ARV]) use and adherence, presence of immunocompromising conditions or medications, Among the 1,487 eligible survey respondents from the VE study (457 case-patients and 1,030 control patients), 207 (13.9%; 150 case-patients and 57 control patients) reported close contact with a person with mpox and were included in this analysis. Compared with control patients, case-patients were slightly older (aged 35.5 years versus 33 years) and had fewer recent sexual partners (two versus three) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** P-values comparing the percentage of case-patients to control patients by sociodemographic and health categories were calculated using Pearson’s chi-square test. P-values for continuous variables were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. *** HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. **** Symptoms consistent with mpox included rash or skin lesions, fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches. In the unadjusted models, behaviors associated with increased odds of mpox among persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox included condomless receptive anal sex (OR = 3.2; p = 0.006), condomless insertive anal sex (OR = 2.8; p = 0.009), receiving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.7; p = 0.006), giving oral sex without a condom (OR = 2.0; p = 0.046), and sharing towels, bedding, or clothing (OR = 2.3; p = 0.034) ( * Case- and control patients were recruited from the following 12 U.S. jurisdictions: California (excluding Los Angeles County), Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, District of Columbia, Los Angeles County, Maryland, Minnesota, New York (excluding New York City), New York City, Oregon, and Tennessee. ** HIV PrEP use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who did not report living with HIV. HIV ARV use was defined as use at time of survey and was calculated among persons who reported living with HIV; nonadherence was defined as missing ≥2 doses during the previous 30 days. Numerous studies have identified sexual contact as the primary risk factor for mpox; however, few have examined risk associated with specific intimate and nonintimate close contact behaviors. In this study, data from a previously conducted case-control study were analyzed to estimate the odds of mpox associated with selected intimate and nonintimate behaviors among MSM and transgender persons reporting close contact with a person with mpox. Condomless sex, including anal sex and oral sex, was associated with increased odds of mpox, as was sharing towels, bedding, and clothing. After adjusting for measured confounders, including mpox vaccination and concurrent close contact behaviors, condomless receptive anal sex with a person with mpox remained associated with increased odds of mpox. Although condoms might reduce MPXV exposure at anogenital or oral mucosal sites, condoms alone might not prevent all exposures to MPXV because rash can occur on other parts of the body and transmission can occur through other routes, including saliva and respiratory secretions ( As clade II mpox continues to circulate in the United States, mpox mitigation activities remain critical ( Studies from areas with endemic mpox and during the ongoing 2022 global outbreak have identified contaminated household items such as linens and utensils as potential, albeit less common, MPXV transmission routes ( The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, selection bias is likely because survey participation was voluntary and recruitment for control patients occurred in sexual health, HIV care, or HIV PrEP clinics. Differences in sexual risk-taking behaviors might exist between those who participated in the survey and those who did not and between persons who did and did not seek health care. Second, survey data were self-reported and might be subject to social desirability or recall bias, particularly because of the sensitive nature of some of the questions regarding sexual behaviors, and because the time between index event and survey completion varied. Third, intimate contact and sexual behavior variables were limited to a few broad measures in this study and do not account for potentially important factors such as frequency and duration of contact, partner type, group sex, substance use, or impact of sexual networks, all of which might affect risk for mpox transmission. Fourth, <15% of survey participants reported close contact with a person with mpox; because of this small sample size, the analysis might be underpowered to detect associations with behaviors that were less commonly reported. Finally, although the 12 U.S. jurisdictions included in this study covered a broad geographic area, data might not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population. The mpox vaccine is highly effective, and clinicians should continue to promote vaccination among eligible persons.",[],2024-10-10,Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,STI
11465850,"Exploring cultural competence barriers in the primary care sexual and reproductive health centres in Catalonia, Spain: perspectives from immigrant women and healthcare providers","Immigrant populations, especially women, continue facing challenges in accessing quality healthcare, particularly sexual and reproductive health services (SRH). Poor cultural competent health systems contribute to communication challenges between immigrant women and healthcare providers perpetuating health disparities. This exploratory study describes these communication barriers from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers within the Catalan health system and its implications to ensure an equitable provision of SRH services. An exploratory-descriptive qualitative study was conducted in various municipalities of Barcelona with high concentration of immigrants. Eight focus groups ( Language barriers and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of quality healthcare provision hindered the ability of immigrant women and providers to interact effectively. Limited availability of intercultural mediators and inadequate cultural competence training opportunities for health staff were also identified. Findings suggest a lack of minority representation in the Catalan health workforce and leadership roles. This study reinforces the evidence of persistent inequities in accessing healthcare among immigrant populations by focusing on the cultural competence barriers of the Catalan health system in the provision and access to SRH services. The regularization of adequately trained intercultural mediators, quality training in cultural competence for health staff and a commitment to increase workforce diversity would contribute to improve intercultural communication between immigrant patients and providers. An urgent call to action in this direction is needed to ensure an equitable access to SRH services among immigrant women. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12939-024-02290-5.","Despite efforts made over the last two decades, evidence of disparities between immigrants and non-immigrants in accessing healthcare services persist across Europe [ Intercultural communication in healthcare is the interaction between healthcare professionals and patients of different cultural groups (international, interfaith, interethnic, interracial) to reach an understanding, build a shared reality and establish a satisfactory relationship [ The concept of cultural competence goes beyond healthcare providers’ intercultural communication skills and also involves the ability of organizations to effectively deliver healthcare services that meet the social, cultural and linguistic needs of patients [ In Spain, significant immigration flows began at the turn of the millennium when the non-native population doubled in just one decade, a growing tendency which has continued until now [ Up to date, a very few studies have addressed cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Spanish and Catalan contexts [ An exploratory-descriptive qualitative research design [ Immigrant women and healthcare providers were selected using maximum variability sampling: convenience, purposive and snowball sampling techniques were combined based on age, length of stay in Spain, educational background or healthcare role. Inclusion criteria for immigrant women were determined by their country of origin (Morocco and Pakistan), age at migration (16 years or older, thus not exposed to the public Spanish education system) and their eligibility to the cervical cancer screening program in Catalonia (aged 25 or turning 25 in the year of the study, up to 65 and having a cervix). The main inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were that they needed to be working actively in the primary care SRH centres and interacting directly with these two groups of immigrants. No exclusion criteria were established for healthcare professionals, but we ensured that providers reported at least ten consultations per week with immigrant patients from Morocco and/or Pakistan. Half of healthcare professionals reported that at least 50% of their patients were immigrants. The final sample size was determined when data saturation was achieved, indicating that additional interviews no longer provided new insights into the key dimension of the study. We recruited Moroccan and Pakistani participants in neighbourhoods of Barcelona city, Sant Adrià del Besòs, Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat. These were chosen because they represent different health districts, have a high proportion of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrants and include urban and semi-urban residential areas. We recruited a wide range of healthcare professionals, such as community health workers, nurses, midwives, gynaecologists, all of whom worked in primary care SRH centres located in the same areas where most women participants were recruited. An intercultural mediator was also included, as these professionals greatly contribute in the provision of care for immigrants. Study fieldwork was performed between July and December 2022. A total of 8 focus group discussions (FGDs) (4 [all in Darija] with 24 participants from Morocco and 4 [all in Urdu] with 27 participants from Pakistan), 22 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) (12 [7 in Darija and 5 in Spanish] with Moroccan and 10 [5 in Urdu, 1 in Punjabi and 4 in Spanish] with Pakistani women) and 13 key informant interviews (KIIs) [all in Spanish] with healthcare providers were conducted. Topic guides for FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women were designed based on a literature review on barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening among immigrant populations conducted for a broader study mentioned above. Questions covered individual (i.e. lack of language skills), interpersonal (i.e. social influences and cultural norms) and health system (i.e. interpreting and translation services) level factors. FGDs were moderated by a nurse (HOE) and a community health worker (SMH) with the same cultural and linguistic background as participants, and the first author (JGL) and two research assistants (RAs) (KM and AS), second-generation immigrant university students, conducted the SSIs. FGDs were conducted in community and religious centres (e.g. mosques) and the interviews were conducted in places chosen by the participants (e.g. women’s and interviewers’ home, religious centres). Further details of the data collection process have been reported elsewhere [ Interviews with healthcare providers explored their views and experiences providing SRH services, and specifically cervical cancer screening, to immigrant women. The overall goal was to understand how these women access healthcare, their preventive health practices, and their engagement with SRH services from the perspective of those who directly work with immigrant populations. These KIIs with healthcare providers also aimed to identify potential cultural and religious barriers and discuss strategies to increase participation in cervical cancer screening programmes, including the potential acceptance of HPV self-sampling. The first author (JGL) carried out all the interviews with healthcare professionals. These took place in the providers’ workplace, except three interviews which were conducted either at the interviewee’s home ( The RAs (KM and AS) transcribed women’s audio recordings from Darija and Urdu directly into Spanish and English, respectively, with minor editing to improve readability. The first author (JGL) and a co-author (VRS, physician and public health student) transcribed healthcare providers’ audio recordings into Spanish. We conducted a social constructionist thematic analysis [ After coding and analysing the two datasets from immigrant women and healthcare providers separately, a data triangulation process was performed following a ‘complementary’ approach: searching to describe a problem (e.g. cultural competence barriers to access SRH services) from different perspectives [ 
 Summary of cultural competence barriers in the provision of SRH services in the Catalan health system using Betancourt et al.’ (2003) framework • Lack of language skills • Perceived discriminatory attitudes • Time pressure in the provision of care • Cultural taboos (e.g. offering certain SRH services) • Limited patient informed consent and confidentiality • Limited availability of intercultural mediators • Limited and underused translation services and materials • Lack of adequate cultural competence training for health staff • Low minority representation in the healthcare workforce (e.g. nurses) • Low minority representation in leadership roles The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (26186), Bellvitge University Hospital (PR 140/22) and Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (PR(AG)317/2022). Each participant was provided with comprehensive information about the study and gave written informed consent prior to data collection. Immigrant women were compensated with a public transportation 10-trip pass to ensure that participation did not impose a financial burden on them (transport to FGDs’ and SSIs’ locations) and to acknowledge their contribution to the research. Healthcare professionals did not receive any compensation. The Moroccan and Pakistani participants’ ages ranged from 24 to 65 years. The majority (82.2%) were married and nearly all Pakistani women (97.3%) had children, compared with 77.8% of Moroccan women. The primary reason for migration was family reunification. Despite most women (80.0%) of both groups having lived in Catalonia for over 5 years, up to 63% of them (52.8% Moroccan and 73% Pakistani) reported needing a translator during medical visits. A similar percentage was found among women who had arrived in the country (less than 5 years ago). Moroccan women were more likely to speak Spanish or Catalan at home than Pakistani women (33% vs. 5%). A total of 72.6% of participants reported having been screened for cervical cancer at least once in their lifetime. Women’s detailed socio-demographic information can be found in Table  Healthcare providers’ ages ranged from 29 to 59 years. All of them were female, except for a gynaecologist and a community health worker. Furthermore, eight healthcare professionals were Spanish (mainly from Catalonia) and bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) and, five were originally from either Morocco or Pakistan and one of them also bilingual (Spanish/Catalan) (Table  
 Women’s socio-demographic characteristics by country of origin ( CC: cervical cancer; IQR: interquartile range 
 Characteristics of healthcare providers interviewed Qualitative findings from the FGDs and SSIs with immigrant women, as well as from the interviews with healthcare professionals are presented below and organised by each of the cultural competence barriers identified in the framework proposed by Betancour et al. (2003) [ We identified the inability to understand and speak either of the two official languages in Catalonia (Spanish/Catalan) as a barrier among Moroccan and Pakistani women regardless of their length of stay in the country. According to healthcare providers’ perceptions, language barriers appeared more prevalent among Pakistani than Moroccan women. Women from both countries often depended on the availability of their husbands, family members and friends to arrange appointments or to receive information. For instance, when their male partners could not accompany them, some women preferred to skip or postpone medical appointments until someone else was available. Whereas Pakistani women tended to visit the doctor with their husbands, Moroccan participants counted also on friends and even on other compatriots they met while waiting in the primary care centre for appointments. Whilst the support of the husband and other family members and friends seemed to attenuate the language barriers of women, this did not guarantee that they received accurate information about SRH services. Healthcare providers reported inadequate and incomplete translations by male partners and family members: 
 Immigrant women and healthcare providers mentioned having personal strategies to overcome language barriers. Some women managed to communicate with providers using body language, through mobile phone conversations with family members or through paper notes, as this provider explained: Body language, visual materials (e.g. pictograms), physical objects (e.g. plastic uterus), translated forms and Google Translator were resources used by midwives and gynaecologists to overcome language barriers: They also emphasized the importance of expressing empathy and building rapport with immigrant patients through eye contact and using some words in their local languages to improve communication, as this female midwife explained:  While immigrant women considered the Catalan health service to be good overall, even better than in their own countries, and healthcare providers to be “caring”, some women felt they did not receive the care they expected. Several participants reported a lack of empathy and unhelpful attitudes from the health staff, especially clinic receptionists, but also some healthcare providers. Women from both Moroccan and Pakistani origin reported feelings that health staff were racist and held discriminatory attitudes against them when they could not communicate properly in Catalan or Spanish, for instance, to book a medical appointment. This deterred some women from seeking healthcare services in Catalonia and instead, seeking care in their own countries: Immigrant women also reported negative and discriminatory attitudes from healthcare providers, especially clinic receptionists, when they requested or expressed their preference for a female professional to undertake gynaecology examinations, deterring them from requesting a same sex provider in the Catalan health system: We observed that lack of culturally sensitive policies or clear guidelines to address cultural conflicts led to some confusion concerning the right of immigrant women to request a healthcare professional of the same sex. Most providers interviewed understood Moroccan and Pakistani women´s preferences for female doctors and stated that they should have the right to request it. However, two gynaecologists raised concerns that choosing the sex of the health professional would contradict the gender equity and non-discrimination policies of the Catalan health system: Even when immigrant women possessed basic or everyday language capacity, some felt they were not being listened to properly as health providers did not give them sufficient time to explain themselves: Healthcare providers confirmed this impression, explaining they have limited time allocated for each patient. Time pressure was even stronger when seeing immigrant patients with language difficulties, low literacy and lack of knowledge of the Catalan health system. This led providers to feel more overloaded and to express feelings of frustration and exhaustion: 
 
 We identified cultural differences between women and healthcare providers’ beliefs and perceptions regarding the use of certain SRH services and the context in which they would discuss them. Addressing women’s health issues, such as menstruation, in front of male relatives (e.g. husbands, sons) and offering specific SRH services, such as contraception and pregnancy termination services, could be considered offensive or against women’s cultural and religious practices, while for healthcare providers these were common issues addressed with their patients. Cultural differences were also identified regarding certain health examinations, such as cervical cancer screening, at specific times, for example, during Ramadan. A midwife also referred to the difficulties that husbands sometimes found when explaining certain women’s issues: Healthcare professionals also mentioned difficulties in addressing topics related to sexual health and genitalia. In this, they distinguished between first-generation and second-generation immigrants, perceiving the latter to be more aware of their bodies and willing to ask questions about sexual health, whereas the former were more ‘detached’ from their own bodies and had lower literacy about their own anatomy. This led some healthcare providers to provide basic information about certain tests: While immigrant women considered their husbands and other relatives as the most important social support in the host country, the health professionals sometimes found them more of an obstacle during health consultation. For instance, some professionals expressed concern about whether immigrant women made informed decisions about their SRH:  Despite this informed consent issue, a midwife emphasized the importance of establishing a good relationship with husbands due to their role as decision-makers. However, she pointed that culturally this is a challenging goal: Similarly, healthcare professionals felt that the presence of a family member reduces confidentiality and provider-patient privacy, something that is a foundation of how healthcare professionals understand quality care. For instance, the presence of relatives prevented providers from screening Moroccan and Pakistani women for highly sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or sexually transmitted infections (STIs):  Healthcare providers also reported challenges in ensuring confidentiality when they need to communicate a test result or give an appointment by phone to a woman with language difficulties, and a midwife expressed other ethical challenges they face when immigrant women go to the health centre accompanied by their underaged children to help them with translation. In these circumstances, she explained that professionals skip some explanations regarding the genitals and vaginal examination and give the patient only basic information. Gynaecologists and midwives narrated their strategies to ensure users’ privacy and confidentiality, but all of them agreed that the availability of intercultural mediators would be the most effective support to ensure confidentiality and health informed decisions: We found disparities in the provision of intercultural mediators across the Catalan health system. Whilst the primary care centres in those neighbourhoods of Barcelona city with the highest concentration of immigrants, such as Raval and Besòs, offered intercultural mediator services in various languages (e.g. Arabic, Urdu, Chinese), in other municipalities with similar volume of immigrants, such as Terrassa and L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, these services were very limited or even non-existent: Since mediator services were scarce, informal interpreter services were voluntarily provided by health staff of Moroccan and Pakistani origin, as this gynaecologist explained:  We also found that the intercultural mediators working currently in Barcelona are not integrated into the health system. Most of these professionals received training in intercultural mediation in the past and currently they are hired by outsourced companies and work in challenging conditions, as some providers confirmed and a mediator explained:  Despite the scarcity of intercultural mediators and lack of integration of these professionals within the health system, interviewed healthcare providers agreed that intercultural mediators play an important role in ensuring effective communication and provision of quality care to immigrant patients who lack language skills, especially in the paediatric and primary care SRH centres. They advocated for the regulation of the cost of these services in the Catalan health system and emphasized the importance of equipping these professionals with adequate intercultural mediation training to minimise potential conflicts, as healthcare providers pointed out that these professionals are not mere interpreters, but health mediators with specific training in cultural skills: One healthcare professional added that even when the mediation services are needed and available, these must be offered as an option, referring to the reluctance expressed by some immigrant women to use these services due to a lack of trust. In this sense, a midwife concluded that greater efforts must be made to explain the role of the intercultural mediators and facilitate trustee relationships between these and immigrant patients. Finally, a midwife highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the gender of the mediators, at least in the primary care SRH centres:  In addition to this insufficient number of intercultural mediators, we found an underutilisation of the available telephone translation service (061 Salut Respon) by providers. They expressed mixed opinions about this service’s effectiveness. Some considered it a good alternative if mediators were not available, but most admitted to not using this service because it was too slow for the limited time assigned per patient and suboptimal to address language and cultural problems. A few healthcare professionals were even unaware of its existence. The availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate information and education materials seemed also scarce. Healthcare professionals noted that the webpage from the Department of Health (Canal Salut), is translated into English and French in addition to the official languages in Catalonia. They explained that they usually used information and education materials (e.g. questionnaires, forms, health prevention flyers) translated into different languages, although some providers mentioned a lack of translations in Urdu, for instance. The majority of the healthcare professionals interviewed had attended cultural competence training courses at some point in their careers. They found the courses helpful but inadequate, as they were often short, general and lacked interactive activities. Some providers strongly believed that formal and compulsory training on cultural competence should be integrated into the healthcare professionals’ curriculum. Currently, cultural competence training sessions are usually provided by community-based and non-governmental organisations, and lack institutionally funding, relying on the availability of private funds. Some healthcare professionals also proposed training administrative staff, particularly receptionists, on migrants’ rights because  Healthcare providers mentioned that an ideal solution to overcome cultural competence issues would be to have a more diverse health workforce, in this case, more Moroccan and Pakistani nurses, midwives and gynaecologists:  Immigrant women also welcomed the availability of more healthcare staff from their own countries and they thought this would improve communication between immigrant patients and providers. A few Moroccan participants observed an increasing number of pharmacists, nurses, auxiliary nurses and doctors with Arabic language skills:  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing cultural competence barriers in the context of the primary care SRH centres in Catalonia, Spain, from the perspective of Moroccan and Pakistani immigrant women and healthcare providers. First, at clinical level, the results indicate that lack of command of the local languages (Spanish and Catalan) and cultural differences in health needs, expectations, care-seeking behaviours and understanding of the provision of quality care hindered the ability of immigrant women and care providers to interact effectively. Second, at structural level, we identified limited availability of intercultural mediator services and translation materials, and inadequate cultural competence trainings available for healthcare staff. Finally, at organisational level, results suggest low minority representation in the health workforce and leadership roles of the Catalan health system. Lack of knowledge of the host country’s official languages is one of the dominant barriers to obtain accurate health information, and access and use of quality healthcare services [ The contested issue about the sex of the healthcare provider, especially providing SRH services, has been extensively addressed in the literature [ Time pressure was also a relevant factor hindering communication between immigrant patients and healthcare providers. On the one hand, immigrant women reported not being given sufficient time to explain their health problems and, on the other hand, healthcare providers reported that low language skills often meant immigrant patients required longer consultation times and greater efforts to communicate with them. This, along with time constraints due to heavy patient loads, led providers to feeling frustrated and overworked, which was attributed by one gynaecologist to immigrants’ inappropriate use of healthcare services. This perception concerning immigrants’ use of the public healthcare services was also found in previous studies conducted in Catalonia with healthcare providers [ The above findings demonstrate how the intersection of language barriers and lack of sufficient resources (e.g. personnel) hinder the communication between immigrant patients and healthcare professionals. Despite these challenges, we found that both immigrant women and healthcare professionals made efforts to understand each other. Non-verbal communication, such as body language and pictograms, and the use of Google Translator were some personal strategies reported in this and previous studies conducted with migrants in Europe [ Consistent with previous research conducted with immigrant populations in Australia and the US [ Limitations to ensure confidentiality and obtained informed consent from immigrant women were other concerns raised by healthcare providers, who agreed that a fair deployment of intercultural mediators would help to address the above linguistic and cultural differences. However, we identified significant disparities in the deployment of intercultural mediators across the Barcelona province, with services predominantly available in primary care centres located in specific neighbourhoods within Barcelona city. This limited availability of mediator services aligns with findings from a recent systematic review assessing barriers and facilitators to access interpreter services in European health systems [ As in other studies performed in Pakistan and Finland [ Finally, field observation and key informant consultations suggested that the representation of minorities in the Catalan healthcare workforce is still low. Studies in the US have shown that diversity and inclusion can help organisations improve both patient care quality and financial results [ Based on our research evidence, the above cultural competence barriers at clinical, structural and organisational levels should be addressed in parallel with other health system deficiencies, such as saturation, excess of demand, insufficient time per patient [ This study has several methodological strengths and limitations. It is noteworthy to mention that the researchers’ social position (e.g. gender, age, race, immigration status) and personal characteristics and experiences affect the research process [ Regarding the study limitations, it is important to mention that the inclusion of only two national groups limits the generalizability of the findings to other immigrant experiences and cultural backgrounds, although it serves as a valuable case study. Additionally, the small sample size of healthcare professionals, who primarily work in areas with high concentration of immigrant populations, may not capture the perspectives from those working in areas where immigrants are less represented. This study emphasizes significant cultural competence barriers within the Catalan health system that hinder immigrant patient-provider relationship, potentially increasing disparities in accessing SRH services in Catalonia, Spain. Addressing these barriers requires a fair deployment of intercultural mediators, clear guidelines to help manage cultural challenges, the formalization of cultural competence training for healthcare professionals, and a commitment to increase workforce diversity. These steps are crucial to mitigating the impact of language barriers and cultural differences on communication between immigrant patients and providers, thereby improving access to quality care. Health systems across Europe, including the Catalan health system, are urged to take a proactive role and implement on-the-ground actions aiming to improve cultural competence and ensure an equitable provision of quality care for immigrant populations.

11465159,Naa80 is required for actin N-terminal acetylation and normal hearing in zebrafish,"A zebrafish knockout model of the N-terminal acetyltransferase Naa80 demonstrates that this enzyme is required for actin N-terminal acetylation and normal inner ear development. Actin is a critical component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. In animals, actins undergo unique N-terminal processing by dedicated enzymes resulting in mature acidic and acetylated forms. The final step, N-terminal acetylation, is catalyzed by NAA80 in humans. N-terminal acetylation of actin is crucial for maintaining normal cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility in human cell lines. However, the physiological impact of actin N-terminal acetylation remains to be fully understood. We developed a zebrafish ","Actin, the most abundant protein in animal cells, plays a crucial role in a wide range of cellular functions.

Genotyped  About 0.5 μg protein as tryptic peptides dissolved in 2% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.5% formic acid (FA), were injected into an Ultimate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected online to a Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with EASY-spray nano-electrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sample was loaded and desalted on a pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 2 cm × 75 µm ID nanoViper column, packed with 3 µm C18 beads) at a flow rate of 5 µl/min for 5 min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated during a biphasic ACN gradient from two nanoflow UPLC pumps (flow rate of 200 nl/min) on a 50 cm analytical column (PepMap RSLC, 50 cm × 75 μm ID EASY-spray column, packed with 2 µm C18 beads). Solvent A and B were 0.1% TFA (vol/vol) in water and 100% ACN, respectively. The gradient composition was 5% B during trapping (5 min) followed by 5–8% B over 1 min, 8–25% B for the next 124 min, 25–36% B over 30 min, and 36–80% B over 5 min. Elution of very hydrophobic peptides and conditioning of the column were performed during 10 min isocratic elution with 80% B and 15 min isocratic conditioning with 5% B. Instrument control was through Thermo Fisher Scientific SII for Xcalibur 1.6. The eluting peptides from the LC-column were ionized in the electrospray and analyzed by the Orbitrap Exploris 480.

 All experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animal Management Rules of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China and were reviewed by Animal Ethical and Welfare of Tianjin University (TJUE-2023-141). HT22 cells were obtained from the Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and used for all  HT22 cells (1 × 10 Bare electrodes and MoS Adult male Wistar rats (250–280 g) were housed under standard conditions, with  The MoS The preparation of the MoS UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by using a Shimadzu 3600 double-beam spectrophotometer with QS-grade quartz cuvettes at room temperature. XPS spectra analysis was carried out on the ESCALAB 250 Xi system (Thermo Scientific) with an Al Kα X-ray source operating at 300 W, and the original data were peak-fitted in XPSPEAK41 software. The surface morphologies of MoS In order to study the effect of surface roughness on electrode performance, Ag electrode was modified with different deposition potentials of MoS All electrochemical measurements were carried out in PBS electrolyte at pH 7.4 at room temperature, completed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The three-electrode configuration was used, with the MoS For EIS, the test frequency range was set to 1 - 10 The CV was performed by scanning for two cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s over a potential range of −0.8 V–0.1 V. The CSCc was calculated by integrating the current overtime in the potential range of −0.8 to 0.1 V in the second cycle. Bending stability was assessed by bending 5 mm electrodes by 30°, 90°, and 180° using custom molds, respectively, and then testing the electrochemical impedance of the bent electrodes with a three-electrode system. Bending stiffness was characterized using a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (Q800, TA Instruments) in double cantilever mode. Electrodes with a length of 6 cm were mounted on a cantilever clamp, and then were tested with frequency sweeps (0.01–10 Hz) under controlled displacement (100 μm) conditions. The MoS The bare electrode and the MoS The total antioxidant activity of the electrodes was assayed by the ABTS rapid method and the procedure was carried out according to the instructions of the kit. The absorbance of the same volume of sample at 414 nm was determined using the UV-vis spectrophotometer.

The signal was recorded digitally at a sampling rate of 30 kHz for at least 30 min per acute recording. The acquired LFP signals were intercepted in a 20 s window and band-pass filtered from 1 to 50 Hz, and then the power spectrum was plotted by FFT. Multi-band band-pass filtering was applied to the LFP signal to categorize it into five bands: δ (1–4 Hz), θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–14 Hz), β (14–30 Hz) and γ (30–50 Hz), and the time domain plots of different frequency bands were plotted and their energies are calculated. The phase synchronization of the LFP signals acquired from the bare and MoS x is the cross spectrum of the two signals, ∂(x) is the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum, E(.) is the expected value operator. The WPLI results range between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate higher phase synchronization and stronger coupling. Random signal matching experiment is performed by labeling each segment of electrophysiological signals with a serial number and then using a randomized algorithm to generate matching sequences and calculate the WPLI. All the analyses performed on the LFP signals were implemented using MATLAB code. One week after electrode implantation, the rats were anesthetized and perfused with PBS followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA), and their fresh brains were collected. The brains were fixed in 30 mL of PFA for 24 h, then dehydrated in a gradient using 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solutions, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compounds (Tissue-Tek, USA). The brains were then cut into 20 μm sections and mounted on glass slides (stored at −80°C). For staining, the brain sections were brought to room temperature, washed with PBS, then treated for 30 min with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in 1x PBS) and 10% donkey serum. Excess liquid was removed, and primary antibodies including GFAP (Abcam, ab4648, 1:10), Iba1 (Thermo, MA5-27726, 1:100), and NeuN (CST, 94403S, 1:100) were applied and incubated overnight at 4°C. The sections were washed with PBS to remove excess primary antibody solution, and then secondary antibodies were added in a light-protected environment, including CoraLite488-conjugated Affinipure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (Proteintech, SA00013-6, 1:100), and Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor 594) (Abcam, ab150108, 1:100). After incubating for 100 min, the excess secondary antibodies were washed off with PBS. Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the sections were imaged using a confocal microscope. Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence graphs was performed using ImageJ, which was implemented by a program script that calculates the fluorescence intensity of the biomarker inside the circle with a radius step of 25 μm from the center of the circle as the center of the electrode implantation position and normalizes it.

11464347,The mediating role of social connectedness and negative cognitive emotion regulation in the association between problematic Internet use and depression among adolescents,"While the relationship between adolescent problematic Internet use (PIU) and depression has been extensively researched, few studies have investigated the role and mechanisms of social connectedness (SC) in this context. This study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of social connectedness (SC) and cognitive emotion regulation (CER) in the relationship between PIU and depression. We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 9,407 adolescents aged 12–18 years in China from September 2022 to March 2023. We employed Young’s 20-item Internet Addiction Test (IAT-20), the Social Connectedness Scale-Revised (SCS-R), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CER), and the DSM-5 Level-2 Depression Scale to assess mental health outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was also performed to examine the independent association between the measured variables and depression. Mediation analysis was then conducted to evaluate the mediating roles of social connectedness and cognitive emotion regulation in the relationship between PIU and depression. We found that the prevalence of PIU was 21.8%. Offline SC (indirect effect: 0.112, 95% CI: 0.104–0.121) and negative CER (indirect effect: 00.140, 95% CI: 0.129–0.152) mainly played a parallel mediating role in the relationship between PIU and depression, along with online SC (on_SC) (indirect effect: 0.007, 95% CI: 0.005–0.010). These findings provide valuable insights into how PIU is associated with depression and highlight the importance of fostering real-life interpersonal interactions. However, the generalizability of this study’s findings to other populations may be limited due to cultural factors.","Problematic Internet use (PIU), commonly identified as a new form of addictive behavior ( Individuals with PIU are more likely to develop depression ( For instance, a study conducted in China involving 17,058 middle school students found that adolescents with Internet addiction were more likely to experience depression, with anxiety partially mediating this relationship ( Higher levels of SC have been associated with the use of positive coping strategies when facing challenges ( Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) determines the coping strategies an individual uses to manage the intensity and nature of emotional experience ( Several mediating factors in the association between PIU and depression have been identified, such as fear of missing out, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and bodily pain ( Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of PIU among adolescents aged 12–18 years in China and to assess its impact on depression. The secondary objective was to examine the potential mediating effects of SC and CER, as well as to explore their interaction within the relationship between PIU and depression. Additionally, we aimed to investigate any differences between online and offline SC as mediators. This cross-sectional study was conducted across four Chinese provinces—Fujian, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Xinjiang—representing the eastern, southern, western, and northern regions of China, respectively, from September 2022 to March 2023. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (NO. 2019-907). In each province, one to two middle schools were selected for participation in the study ( Flowchart of the procedure for data collection. A total of 11,946 adolescents were included in this survey, which was administered online using non-skippable questions to ensure no missing responses. Based on the following criteria, 2,539 questionnaires were excluded: (1) participants reporting an age younger than 12 or older than 18; (2) participants who completed the survey in less than 10 min; (3) participants who indicated that their responses were “false” or “entirely false” when asked, “To what extent does your survey reflect the real situation?” (entirely false, false, general, true, entirely true) at the end of the survey; (4) and questionnaires missing key demographic information. Additionally, questionnaires with matching attributes—such as name, age, sex, height, weight, and school affiliation—were considered duplicates, and only the most complete data set was retained for further analysis. Ultimately, data from 9,407 participants (14.90 ± 1.61 years) were included in this study, representing 78.7% of the total sample. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic variables, including age, sex, only-child status, handedness, place of residence, father’s education level, and mother’s education level. The IAT-20, developed by Oliveira et al. ( The Social Connectedness Scale Revised (SCS-R), developed by Lee and Robbins ( The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) was used to evaluate CER strategies applied in response to stressful events ( The DSM-5-TR Level 2—Depression—Child Age 11–17 measure is a 14-item patient-reported outcome measurement tool from the PROMIS Depression Short Form, developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), designed to assess depression in children and adolescents ( Categorical variables were described using numbers (percentages), while continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviations). Social connectedness (SC) measurements included on_SC, off_SC, and SC_gap (calculated as the difference between the on_SC and off_SC scores). Based on whether the SC_gap score was positive or negative, participants were categorized into the “more online” and “more offline” groups, respectively. Univariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify whether PIU, social connectedness, pCER and nCER were associated with depression among adolescents. Then, the multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify whether PIU, social connectedness, pCER and nCER were independently associated with depression among adolescents. Spearman’s correlation was conducted to examine mutual correlations between sociodemographic variables, PIU, SC measures, CER, and depression. Variables that were significantly associated with depression in the multivariate logistic regression were subsequently included in the structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the mediating effects of SC and CER in the relationship between PIU and depression. The effect size in the mediation analysis was assessed using the STDYX standardized effect size. The fit of the hypothesis models was evaluated using the chi-squared degrees of freedom ratio (χ A total of 2,000 bootstraps were conducted, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the estimates were calculated. Sociodemographic variables that were independently associated with depression in multivariate regression were adjusted for in all SEM models. Group differences, regression, and correlation analysis were conducted using SPSS 26.0, while SEM analysis was conducted using Mplus 8.0 ( The prevalence of depression (mild to severe) and PIU were 35.8 and 21.8%, respectively.

Adjusted ORs (95% CI) based on multivariable logistic regression using depression-or-not as a dependent variable, sociodemographic factors, SC_gap, pCER, nCER, and PIU. According to univariate logistic regression, on_SC, off_SC, SC_gap, nCER, pCER, and PIU showed significant associations with depression ( After adjusting for confounding factors (sex, handedness, and residence), SC_gap, nCER, and PIU had independently and significantly positive associations with depression ( The results of Spearman’s correlation analysis are shown in  Spearman’s correlation among sociodemographic variables, PIU, depression, nCER, and SCs. on_SC, online social connectedness; off_SC, offline social connectedness; SC_gap, online-offline social connectedness gap; nCER, negative cognitive emotion regulation; PIU, problematic Internet use, the total score of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT-20). Mediation analysis showed that three chain mediation models were all verified as satisfactory goodness of fit. PIU was directly associated with depression in Models A, B, and C ( In Model A, both on_SC and nCER significantly mediated the relationship between PIU and depression ( The mediation effects of SC ( In Model B, off_SC and nCER were identified as mediators ( In Model C, the single mediating effect of nCER accounted for 37.0% of the total effect ( This study, based on a national sample of 9,407 adolescents in China, yielded novel findings indicating that off_SC, SC_gap, and nCER mainly played parallel mediating roles in the relationship between PIU and depression. Although on_SC also had a significant mediating effect, its role was less prominent compared to off_SC. These findings provide a new perspective on how PIU contributes to depression, highlighting the critical importance of fostering real-life interpersonal interactions to mitigate its negative impact on adolescents. According to this study, the prevalence of PIU among adolescents was 21.8% (95% CI: 20.9–22.6%). This is consistent with a recent survey involving 3,357 Chinese adolescents, which reported a PIU rate of 26.09% ( These discrepancies may partly result from variations in the sampling methods and instruments used. The previous study employed the same questionnaire and PIU cut-off score as ours. However, their sample size was relatively small. In contrast, the latter study employed a parental assessment questionnaire ( A study conducted in Spain showed a higher PIU rate of 33% among adolescents ( To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm the mediating roles of both on_SC and off_SC and their gap in the relationship between PIU and depression. Our findings suggest that adolescents with PIU experienced a significant decline in off_SC, which is consistent with previous research indicating that individuals with PIU make minimal effort to maintain interpersonal relationships ( Additionally, online social connections served as a buffer against depression and anxiety among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic ( This novel finding indicates that PIU leads adolescents to prioritize online interactions over offline communication, thereby increasing the risk of depression. In line with our findings, previous studies have highlighted that face-to-face communication fosters high-quality listening, behavioral synchrony, and self-disclosure, which serve as protective factors against negative emotions ( In addition, our study also demonstrated the mediating role of nCER in the relationship between PIU and depression. Previous research has linked nCER to PIU, including Internet gaming disorder ( Furthermore, those who rely on maladaptive strategies may be more susceptible to psychopathology ( The present study also identified a weak chain mediating effect from SCs to nCER. A study involving 1,291 adolescents in Ireland found that adolescents with PIU experienced less perceived social support and greater difficulty in emotion regulation ( Our SEM analysis supports these findings, demonstrating that off_SC is more effective than on_SC in reducing negative coping strategies, such as catastrophizing. Therefore, interventions aimed at enhancing off_SC should be developed for middle school students, especially those with PIU. For instance, engaging in dual sports activities has shown significant potential in reducing Internet addiction among adolescents ( There are also some limitations to this study. First, the cross-sectional design makes it difficult to establish causality, and future research could benefit from longitudinal studies. Furthermore, adolescents with PIU may use the Internet as a platform for developing other addictions, such as gaming, online shopping, or watching short videos. Moreover, due to research resource constraints, we utilized non-random sampling methods in this study, which may introduce biases associated with specific school-related factors. For instance, the educational quality and management approaches of these schools could influence students’ Internet usage and mental health. Disparities in the allocation of educational resources across provinces may also affect the generalizability of our findings. This study primarily focused on overall problematic Internet usage. Therefore, future studies should consider examining various forms of PIU (e.g., Internet gaming disorder and social media disorder) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of adolescent Internet-related behavioral issues on mental health. Despite these limitations, our study is the first to investigate the potential mediating role of SC and CER strategies. We uncovered an important mechanism that helps explain why adolescents with PIU are more likely to develop depressive symptoms. Targeted interventions and strategies in clinical practice, focusing on enhancing adolescents off_SC and promoting the adoption of positive coping strategies in response to stressors, could help improve the overall mental wellbeing of adolescents.","['problematic Internet use', 'depression', 'adolescents', 'social connectedness', 'cognitive emotion regulation', 'mediation model']",2024-9-26,Frontiers in Public Health,STI
11464204,Understanding the influence of the microbiome on childhood infections,"The microbiome is known to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.","The human microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes – including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea – that have co-evolved with our species for millennia. The number of microbes colonizing our bodies is truly staggering; for instance, infants have an estimated 1.9 trillion human cells but are colonized by more than twice that number of microbial cells, including approximately 4.4 trillion bacterial cells [ At no point across the lifespan is the microbiome as dynamic as during childhood. At birth, infants are colonized by trillions of pioneering microbes from the maternal vaginal, gut, and skin microbiota. Over the ensuing days and months, these microbial communities undergo substantial shifts in composition due to changes in the local microenvironment, environmental exposures, and microbial competition. For instance, shortly after birth, the gut is an aerobic environment typically containing high abundances of facultative anaerobes, including bacteria from the genera  Although recent studies suggest that host genetics influences the microbiota during childhood [ The comparatively few pediatric microbiome studies that have been conducted after infancy suggest that the microbiota continues to develop and mature in response to environmental exposures. In particular, increasing age has consistently been associated with changes in microbiota composition during toddlerhood. During the second and third years of life, the gut microbiota increases in diversity (number of species), and a gradual loss of  Other environmental factors have been associated with alterations to the microbiota during childhood. Among 33 Japanese children, those who attended daycare were less likely to have nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles dominated by the health-associated species  The human microbiota provides protection against infection by preventing colonization and invasion by exogenous pathogens. This important function of the microbiota, referred to as colonization resistance, occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including competition for nutritional sources, production of antimicrobial compounds, alterations of the local microenvironment, and modulation of host immune responses ( Early-life colonization of mucosal surfaces by microbes is critical to immune system development [ The human microbiota continues to modulate immune system function throughout the lifespan. In health, microbiome-host homeostasis is characterized by low levels of inflammation and immune cell recruitment sufficient to create a state that is primed to respond to potential pathogens [ The microbiota influences the development of host immune responses to pathogens through several mechanisms. Commensal microbes can induce host epithelial cells to secrete antimicrobial peptides that target specific pathogens, as well as other commensal species [ With advances in our knowledge of the factors that disrupt microbiome composition during childhood and the role that the microbiota plays in immune development, there has been substantial interest in identifying microbiome characteristics that are associated with infection susceptibility or severity ( Globally, acute respiratory infections cause more than 740,000 child deaths each year [ There are accumulating data that early-life infections alter microbiome composition or function, contributing to differences in colonization resistance and infection susceptibility later in childhood. In a longitudinal study of 114 healthy infants, de Steenhuijsen Piters and colleagues found that asymptomatic viral infections occurring in the first few months of life were associated with a strong upper respiratory mucosal interferon response that coincided with enrichment of the upper respiratory microbiota by genera containing common pathogens ( The severity of respiratory infections is also influenced by upper respiratory microbiota composition. A cross-sectional study of children and adolescents found that a microbiota profile dominated by the putatively beneficial bacterial genera  Substantial evidence links the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric infections and other infections arising from the gut.  Bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality among several vulnerable populations of children. Among premature infants, late-onset sepsis is frequently caused by gut-derived bacteria, and these infections are often preceded by loss of potentially beneficial species from the gut microbiota and an increase in the gut abundance of the BSI-causative strain [ The gut microbiota is also the major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microbes in human populations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which theoretically enables detection of all antibiotic resistance genes present within a sample (referred to as the ‘resistome’), has substantially advanced our ability to study antibiotic resistance during childhood. Several studies of the gut resistome among children have demonstrated that acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs early in life, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment or other recognized risk factors [ Adolescents account for more than half of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States [ The composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota has also been associated with the risk of HIV infection. Women with cervicovaginal microbiomes with low abundances of  The oral microbiome is integral to the pathogenesis of early childhood caries, a condition caused by specific bacteria in the supragingival plaque that create an acidic microenvironment that promotes tooth demineralization and decay. Higher abundances of  With accumulating evidence that the microbiota influences infection risk and severity, there has been substantial interest in the development of microbiome-targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of infections. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, several such interventions have been studied in infants and children. Because the gut microbiota is recognized to play a critical role in the development of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, there has long been interest in modifying the gut microbiota of premature infants through the administration of probiotics. A recent meta-analysis that included 106 randomized controlled trials of more than 25,000 infants concluded that multiple-strain probiotics, especially when combined with prebiotics, were associated with lower incidences of severe necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality, whereas single-strain probiotics combined with lactoferrin were most effective in lowering the incidence of sepsis [ Most studies of probiotics in older children have evaluated these products among children with acute diarrhea or for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or CDI. Probiotic trials conducted among children with diarrheal illnesses have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefit. For instance, in a study of a probiotic containing a strain of the yeast  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used in the management of recurrent CDI for nearly two decades, although use of this procedure in children has been limited until relatively recently. Fortunately, there have been several recent studies demonstrating that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for children with recurrent CDI. For instance, Nicholson and colleagues recently summarized outcomes of 372 patients aged 11 months to 23 years with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT at 18 pediatric health centers between 2004 and 2017 [ Phage therapy, in which viruses that target and kill bacteria (bacteriophages) are used for infection treatment, dates back more than a century; however, there has been renewed interest in phages as a result of rising antibiotic resistance. Few controlled trials of phage therapy have been conducted among children; most notably, a clinical trial of  Vaccines have contributed to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality over the past century and continue to prevent nearly 3 million child deaths each year [ Perhaps the most compelling data supporting an association between the gut microbiota and responses to childhood vaccines comes from experiments conducted in animal models. In a landmark study, Lynn and colleagues demonstrated that infant mice that were exposed to ampicillin and neomycin prior to receipt of inactivated or live vaccines developed inferior vaccine-induced antibody responses [ Findings from clinical studies of the impact of the gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity have demonstrated varied and often conflicting results ( With the recognition that the gut microbiota may influence immune responses to vaccination comes the possibility that targeted modification of the gut microbiota could promote vaccine-elicited immunity. In particular, there has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as vaccine adjuvants. Isolauri and colleagues reported that oral administration of  In conclusion, the human microbiota undergoes marked shifts in composition during early life as a result of environmental exposures. During infancy, these microbes are essential to immune maturation, promoting the generation of protective immune responses to potential pathogens and the development of immune tolerance to commensal microbes and host antigens. Throughout childhood, the commensal microbiota influences the risk and severity of infections through a complex network of microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactions collectively referred to as colonization resistance. This important function of the microbiota influences the risk of many infectious diseases that are common among healthy children and adolescents, including acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, the microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gut-derived BSIs among vulnerable groups of children, including premature infants and pediatric HCT recipients. Data from animal experiments and correlative human studies also suggest that the microbiota influences immune responses to childhood vaccines. Taken together, the studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the substantial influence of the microbiota on infectious diseases during childhood and the enormous potential of microbiome-based therapies to prevent or treat infections and promote vaccine-elicited immunity among children. Our understanding of the influence of the microbiota on childhood infections has advanced remarkably over the past several decades. However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. To date, we know surprisingly little regarding factors that shape microbial communities and their influence on infections outside of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts or in older children and adolescents. For instance, few prior studies have investigated the microbiota of the male reproductive tract and the extent to which it influences the transmission of STIs among adolescents. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of studies of the early life microbiome have focused solely on bacteria, effectively disregarding the potential impact of microbes from other kingdoms on childhood infections. Finally, there is growing recognition that the microbiome field needs to move beyond correlative studies in order to accelerate the development of microbiome-based interventions to prevent or treat infections and other diseases in children. One of the main challenges facing the field is translating what we have learned about the microbiome to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutics for childhood infections. Next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to diagnosing infections. Recently, several commercial laboratories have developed assays that enable detection of clinically relevant microbes in a variety of human samples with a short turnaround time, providing results that can be used to guide clinical decision-making. These sequencing technologies also have the potential to transform the field of infection prevention and control. Multilocus sequence typing, which involves sequencing of only a handful of microbial genes that typically represent less than 1% of the genome, remains a standard approach for the evaluation of healthcare-associated infection clusters [ Since November 2022, the first two microbiota-based human therapeutics for adults with recurrent  As sequencing technologies and analytic methods become increasingly high-throughput and accessible, we anticipate that the study of the child microbiome will advance in several ways over the next 5 years. First, there will be an increase in studies investigating the extent to which fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa influence childhood infections through both microbe-host and microbe–microbe interactions, including interspecies interactions spanning microbial kingdoms. Moreover, we will see a continued shift from simple correlative studies to translational studies that utilize novel experimental models or that integrate data on microbial gene expression, microbial and host metabolites, and host immune responses. Additionally, commercial next-generation sequencing assays will be further validated as diagnostic tools and incorporated into routine clinical practice. Eventually, in time, the pathways for regulatory review and approval will be updated to enable development of an increasingly broad range of microbiome-based therapies that reduce the burden of infectious diseases among children.","['Colonization resistance', 'gastrointestinal microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'respiratory microbiota']",2024-4-12,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,STI
11463776,Barriers and enablers that influence the uptake of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands,"Heterosexual migrant men and women in the Netherlands often face barriers to accessing health services, including HIV testing, that may lead to late-stage HIV diagnoses. This study explored factors of influence in the usage of HIV testing among heterosexual migrants. Qualitative evaluation with semi-structured interviews at the Amsterdam-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint and one focus group discussion (FGD) conducted during June-July 2023 with 19 participants: interviews with 12 heterosexual migrants from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) and FGD (n = 5) and interviews (n = 2) with 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Recorded interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed, using the framework of Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. In total, 55 themes emerged from the interviews and the FGD. Examples include insufficient availability of information on HIV and testing services, and difficulty in accessing these services (e.g. the barrier of the online appointment system of the Centre for Sexual Health (CSH)). HIV test participants expressed free, rapid testing, no appointment required, and a positive experience during their HIV test as enablers to test in the future. Results from key informants showed that poor health literacy and lack of clarity on the healthcare system’s guidelines were barriers for heterosexual migrants in accessing information on HIV and testing services. It also revealed past initiatives and interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the integration of HIV testing into sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, but that were subsequently discontinued due to financial constraints. Factors contributing to a low HIV test uptake were participants’ perception of limited accessibility of CSH facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies on accessing HIV/STI testing services at CSHs, and potential missed opportunities for HIV testing at general practitioners were contributing factors identified by key informants.","While much has been accomplished in the past four decades to reduce transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections, it remains a global health concern with over 39 million people affected, of whom 2.3 million people include the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [ Certain vulnerable groups being affected by HIV, such as heterosexual migrants, require more attention to ensure the UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets are reached. Stigma and discrimination continue to play roles in the low uptake of HIV testing. Gender also plays a role, with an overall higher proportion of migrant women testing for HIV compared with migrant men [ About one-third of all migrants that arrive in the Netherlands each year are from outside the EU [ Most migrants in Europe who live with HIV are often infected postmigration, which demonstrates a need for prevention and testing in countries of arrival. Studies conducted in Europe (including the Netherlands) showed that over 50% of heterosexual migrants originating mainly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Latin America, and the Caribbean acquired HIV postmigration within the first five years [ Sexual health centers (SHCs) and general practitioners (GPs) are the main providers to test for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV in the Netherlands. STI/HIV testing at SHCs is free of charge for high-risk groups (including “those who originate from an HIV/STI endemic area”) and HIV care is reimbursed through Dutch health insurance [ At the end of 2022, there were 1390 people who remained undiagnosed for HIV in the Netherlands [ The COVID-19 government regulations that negatively impacted HIV testing rates in the Netherlands requires active (tailored) case findings of HIV along with strategic scale-up of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrant groups [ To contribute to the Declarations to end the HIV epidemic, and reduce inequities in HIV testing service delivery, this study focused on heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, and aimed to explore factors of influence in the uptake of HIV testing and identify experiences on using HIV testing services. We also aimed to understand the perception of health providers and policy advisors on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among this target population. Recommendations will be formulated to inform policy makers and health providers on strategies for improving the uptake of HIV testing. This qualitative study examined the barriers and enablers of HIV testing usage among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. The city of Amsterdam served as the study site being a densely populated area of more than 250,000 migrants [ The non-governmental organization (NGO) AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Checkpoint was chosen as the facility to conduct semi-structured interviews (SSI) as it provides a low-threshold, no-cost rapid HIV testing service to everyone, which assisted in finding diverse participants. The SHCs, an additional NGO, and research institution served as the main organizations for key informants, including STI nurses, policy advisors, and GPs. Furthermore, the ministry of health was also approached, but was unable to deliver someone to participate in this study. Eligible heterosexual migrants met the following criteria (based on AHF Checkpoint’s HIV test assessment form): identified as female or male, were 18 years of age or older at the time of the SSI, were a migrant from an LMIC in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, or Latin America, and identified as heterosexual. Migrants living in the Netherlands less than five years were considered to be ‘short-term’, while those living in the country five years or more were considered to be ‘long-term’. The study recruited a total of 19 participants comprised of 12 HIV test clients and 7 key informants from the (public) health sector. Convenience sampling was used to recruit HIV test clients for a SSI on-site at AHF Checkpoint, during the days that the interviewer was present. This was done by communicating the study guidelines to the on-site HIV test counselors to inform and invite eligible clients after their HIV test to participate without influence or pressure. A study invitation poster in English and Spanish was posted in the lobby and HIV testing office. Two study participants, who had never tested for HIV, were recruited through word of mouth by Checkpoint clients who saw the study invitation flyer. The selection criteria for key informants were that they be either a GP, STI nurse, or policy advisor, be professionally involved with HIV testing among migrants, and have a working knowledge of the English language. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit seven key informants. Key informants were invited for the FGD via email without influence or pressure. The principal investigator (PI) conducted interviews with HIV test participants and the FGD with key informants (both face-to-face) based on the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model of Health Service Use conceptual framework, using topic guides [ Two key informants could not attend the FGD and instead suggested submitting their input via a Word document using the FGD topic questions as a guide (further referred to as ‘interviewed key informants’). One interview was performed in Spanish while the rest, including the FGD, were performed in English. All respondents provided informed consent before the interviews and FGD. Permission for the PI to audio record and take written notes of the interviews and FGD was granted by all study participants. The interviews and FGD were transcribed manually immediately after each session, and the interview performed in Spanish was first transcribed before being translated into English. Anonymity and confidentiality were ensured by not asking participants for any personal identifiers and not sharing any personal information given by key informants (i.e., name, email address, and phone number). Data collection continued until no new topics emerged. For coding, a hybrid approach was taken, with the research topic guides informing the development of a coding frame matrix, including emerging themes, based on a conceptual framework (for details: see conceptual framework). The data was coded into themes and subthemes from the interviews and FGD. The data was analyzed using this conceptual framework and the latest NVIVO software was used to classify, sort, and arrange the data in order to identify themes and patterns. The study aimed to reach a diverse group of participants and triangulate data through searching for overlapping themes between the HIV test participants and key informants, and with policy documents to ensure a thorough investigation into the research topic. A number of measures were employed to achieve quality assurance: piloting and adjusting the interview topic guide, accommodating Spanish speakers, audio recording the interviews and FGD, safe data storage techniques (including deletion of interview and FGD audio recordings after the final publication of the scientific paper), and regular follow-ups with the other two researchers, and cross-checks with the last author. The study was guided by the Andersen’s Expanded Behavioral Model (HBM) of Health Service Use, which was adapted from the Andersen-Newman 1995 Framework of Health Service Utilization [ Psychosocial factors have an impact on decision-making about planned or intended behavior related to HIV testing, using four domains: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV [ Enabling factors may influence the frequency of usage of HIV testing services. The lack of availability of appropriate resources and support to access health services and care at the individual, contextual, community/social network, and structural levels may impede care that is necessary due to the low supply of services, or financial means [ Need is related to how people perceive their own level of health and functionality (including their risk perception of HIV infection) as well as the perception from a GP or HIV test counselor on an individual’s health and needs [ The expanded Andersen HBM model was used as a framework to analyze the results of this study (deductive approach). Themes that emerged from the interviews and FGD that did not align with this framework were added separately (inductive approach). We focused on the population characteristics and health behavior elements as these were the most relevant in relation to the usage of HIV testing services. Some results sections include information gathered from the key informants that either support or contradict the findings. An overview of Anderson model main domains and emerging themes is presented in  The KIT Research Ethics Committee (REC) approved the research protocol on 25th of May 2023. Ethical aspects involved collecting verbal informed consent from all participants (audio recorded), interview data anonymously, ensuring confidentiality of participants, and applying participant codes when analyzing and using data in the results section. Furthermore, coding and transcription reliability was checked by a second researcher to ensure the process went according to the study protocol and the REC’s recommendations. Out of 12 HIV test (HT) participants, seven resided in the Amsterdam region, and five were from other regions in the Netherlands. Most were highly educated, age range was 20–47 years, duration in the Netherlands varied from 9 months up to 45 years, and several worked in information technology. Regions of origin of the HT participants were Europe, the Middle East, South-East Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, and North and West Africa. Of the 12 HT participants, two had never been tested, six were first-time testers, and four had previously tested between one to four times ( The psychosocial factors involved four domains regarding HIV testing: knowledge of HIV, attitudes towards HIV testing, social and cultural norms on HIV and testing, and perceived behavioral control over HIV. The domains originated from the expanded Andersen HBM and all emerging themes (n = 55) came from the interviews and FGD (see  Knowledge of HIV (including modes of transmission) and HIV test locations were themes that were discussed. While a few HT participants could name at least one HIV transmission mode and one body fluid that can transmit HIV, the overall knowledge of HIV was low. Eight HT participants could name at least ‘blood’ as one body fluid, while two could not name any body fluids that can transmit HIV, and also incorrect examples were given, Some indicated that they briefly learned about sexual education in primary or high school, but those from Eastern Europe and the Middle East stated that it was not taught in their country of origin. The window period of HIV testing, HIV self-test, treatment for HIV and subsequently living a normal life were emerging themes among three HT participants and some key informants. As HT participant P-1 said, 
 Two HT participants understood the need to wait the right amount of time before going for an HIV test (i.e., the window period). One mentioned that he knew to wait at least a couple of months before testing for HIV in order to get a correct result, while the other who had never tested for HIV said, 
 Online (Google) searches were discussed as the main source of information on HIV and where to find HIV test locations. In addition, four HT participants named the SHC of the public health service ( 
 The attitudes of HT participants consisted of their views on HIV testing and its importance. For half of the HT participants, their visit to AHF Checkpoint was the first time they tested for HIV in their lifetime. The majority of HT participants felt that HIV testing was an important way to prevent the spread of HIV and to not only protect one’s safety, but that of others as well. First-time and repeat testing were emerging themes. While two HT participants had never tested for HIV, they held the attitude that testing is important so that one is aware of whether or not they are transmitting the virus. As one said, 
 However, another HT participant pointed out, 
 The theme of ‘repeat testing’ emerged among those who had previously tested as being equally as important in prevention of HIV infection with one stating, Four HT participants were repeat testers (i.e., had tested more than once). One participant, who had tested for the first time in the Netherlands at AHF Checkpoint and three times in their country of origin, confirmed the importance of repeat HIV testing by stating he wanted to make it a routine. Social norms consisted of the following themes: taboo, stigma, cultural perception of HIV, and cultural expectations to care, with sexual orientation as an emerging theme. The theme of taboo was prominent among most HT participants with many stating that sex remains a taboo subject in their respective cultures. While this was not stated as a deterrent to test for HIV, one participant who had never tested for HIV said, 
 HIV test-related stigma was also mentioned by several HT participants as a result of people’s perception of HIV in their culture. As one stated, 
 One HT participant stated that while HIV is talked about, sex is only mentioned in terms of abstinence-only. And, while HIV testing is available in his country, stigma remains: 
 As migrants came from different cultural backgrounds, they had varying views on expectations to care. Most stated they were accustomed to going anywhere in their country of origin for health services. As one mentioned, 
 Key informant K-1 added to this by explaining, 
 Three HT participants mentioned paracetamol as the most common practice by GPs for treatment of general health issues. One key informant (k-5) also acknowledged this, and mentioned that this could result in trust issues with GPs. Another key informant also brought this up as a potential culture shock for migrants, stating, 
 Perceived behavioral control referred to HT participants’ reasoning behind deciding (not) to previously test for HIV and the time they took to decide to test. There were two main themes: risk perception and behavioral skills, with stable relationship and condom use as emerging themes. Fear, shame, and no sexual partner were mentioned to a lesser extent. Two participants who had never tested for HIV and one first-time tester stated that being in a stable or long-term relationship was their main reason for not testing for HIV. One of the never-before HIV testers stated, 
 Shame and not having a sexual partner were mentioned by two HT participants, respectively. Fear was also mentioned by participants and some key informants, and mainly came from HT participants not wanting to know their result at the time, with one first-time tester stating he is a hypochondriac. 
 Key informant K-6 further explained in the context of HIV treatment, 
 The majority of HT participants took less than a week to decide to test for HIV from the moment they thought that they should test. For one participant, it took nine months and for another three years before the first HIV test. Enabling factors involved three domains: the availability of HIV testing services (primarily in Amsterdam, but also other main cities in the Netherlands), including the accessibility to those services, and the openness to speak about HIV and/or testing. Three HT participants came as economic migrants, four came when they were young (age range 2–14) when their families immigrated to the Netherlands. Others came for school or job opportunities). Some HT participants mentioned the availability of HIV testing services to be overall good in the Netherlands. While one participant was only familiar with AHF Checkpoint, he also knew that AHF had testing sites in other cities. As he stated, 
 Themes such as free, without appointment, and rapid testing were seen as the more important determinants to testing at AHF Checkpoint. Other themes mentioned were discreet and convenience in terms of the proximity of AHF Checkpoint and its opening hours. As one stated, 
 Easy accessibility to HIV testing services was mentioned by several HT participants. A few encountered some difficulty in accessing HIV testing services prior to finding AHF Checkpoint. One HT participant who is a long-term migrant said, 
 One HT participant was glad to have found AHF Checkpoint, as he said, 
 The SHCs at the GGDs provide testing services to those residing in their municipality and who meet certain requirements such as age and sexual preference, as stated by key informants. HT participants mentioned AHF Checkpoints having no such restrictions and people from other postal code areas are also allowed to test for HIV. Regarding the age requirement, one HT participant said, Regarding the postal code requirement, another participant stated, “ While none of the participants stated language being a barrier when trying to access HIV testing services at the SHC or GP, key informant K-3 discussed how the SHC provided an online system to make appointments, but encountered some challenges: 
 This domain referred to whether or not HT participants were able to bring up the subject of HIV and/or testing. There were three themes: family, friends, and colleagues. While a couple of HT participants felt it would be fine to approach their family about the topic of HIV (testing) and that they would feel supported, most felt that it would not be a good idea. As one participant discussed, 
 Despite several HT participants coming from conservative cultural backgrounds, the majority felt that they could speak openly with their friends. However, one participant who had never tested for HIV pointed out with regards to family and friends, 
 All HT participants said they would not discuss HIV and/or testing with their colleagues due to either feeling uncomfortable or unnecessary to do so. However, one mentioned, 
 The need factors consisted of two domains: perceived need (HT participant) and evaluated need (Key informants). Perceived need had the theme of an HT participant’s perception of HIV risk, while evaluated need had the theme of key informants’ (GPs’) beliefs on heterosexual migrants’ risk for HIV. An HT participant’s perceived risk for HIV influenced their decision to test, with unprotected sex (mostly from a one-night stand or a new partner) and physical symptoms being an emerging theme. One HT participant mentioned injecting drug use: 
 Since most HT participants had either tested for the first time in their lifetime at AHF Checkpoint or had never been tested for HIV, most had not been to a GP for an HIV test. Two HT participants, both long-term migrants, had been to a GP before to test for HIV. However, one of them who had a first HIV test at AHF Checkpoint discussed how their GP turned them away due to their low risk: 
 To further illustrate this point, key informant K-7 pointed out, 
 The usage of HIV testing services consisted of three main themes: expectations of the HIV test service, experience during the HIV test, and competency of the health providers (i.e., HIV test counselor(s)). Having a knowledgeable HIV test counselor, safe space, anonymity, no judgement, reliability of test, friendly staff, and relaxing setting were mentioned among the HT participants as expectations they had from AHF Checkpoint, with one explaining, 
 Another added, 
 None of the HT participants who had previously tested ever had a negative experience during an HIV test. Participants were asked what they would do or what their reaction would be if they were to ever have an HIV testing experience that was negative or uncomfortable. Some stated that in that case, they would still return to test for HIV for health reasons (i.e., wanting to know the result) and because it’s free. Some mentioned they would either ask for someone else at the Checkpoint to test them or go elsewhere. One HT participant was direct and said, 
 The 10 HT participants who were recruited after their HIV test at AHF Checkpoint expressed that they had a positive experience during their HIV test (two others were never-before testers). Those who experienced some anxiety or panic prior to taking the test mentioned that the HIV test counselor made them feel relaxed and at ease. However, one participant compared his experience to that of their country of origin when entering the Kilo Store (i.e., entrance of the AHF Checkpoint): 
 All HT participants stated that the HIV test counselor on duty had a strong level of competency: They named important attributes that the HIV test counselor(s) possessed: knowledgeable of HIV, reassurance, ability to handle anxiety, and ability to explain the HIV test procedure well. One of the two participants who had never tested for HIV said she would expect the person performing the test to be nonjudgmental, and the other never-before HIV tester mentioned, 
 This factor consisted of two themes: the Dutch healthcare system in relation to HIV testing (as well as general health services) and discrimination. Health literacy was an emerging theme. The majority of HT participants claimed to not know very much about the Dutch healthcare system. Three participants stated knowing that one must first register with a GP before obtaining any type of health service (including HIV testing), and that the SHC (GGD) also offers HIV testing. One HT participant expressed, however, that he already expected the SHC to not be a useful resource for him and his partner for HIV testing: 
 Another HT participant knew of a private clinic in Utrecht, but the cost was a barrier as he said, 
 One key informant mentioned that the health system in the Netherlands is decentralized, with GGD facilities serving as additional resources to the regular healthcare system. Regarding the responsibility to offer HIV testing and prevention services, she added, 
 Moreover, this key informant added to the complexity of the healthcare system in terms of STI/HIV testing: 
 Also, various key informants stated poor health literacy among migrants being the biggest problem because it impedes their ability to know how and where to go for health services. As one key informant stated, 
 All HT participants stated they did not experience discrimination during their HIV test consultation at AHF Checkpoint or when acquiring general health services in the Netherlands. External environment and its influence on the use of HIV testing services referred to two themes: place of residence, and health policies and guidelines. Most HT participants resided in the Amsterdam region, but five resided in different regions, of whom three in cities more than 30 kilometers from Amsterdam. Despite those who reside far away still coming to test for HIV at AHF Checkpoint, one key informant stated geographical availability as a barrier to HIV testing. Regarding HIV prevention awareness geared towards migrant groups, one key informant stated, 
 The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM in Dutch) guideline regarding which groups to include for STI/HIV testing at SHCs, on which financial payment is based, includes people from an endemic HIV country for HIV testing. In reality, however, it is not guaranteed that these individuals could test for HIV at their local SHC, as SHCs have some liberty to make their own priorities due to financial constraints. As key informant K-1 explains, 
 One key informant added that a full STI screening may not always be offered even if the SHC is not at full capacity. Individuals wanting further testing will be referred to their GP. HIV testing guidelines for GPs include an indicator-condition approach as well as offering routine testing to at-risk groups. However, missed HIV testing opportunities at GPs still exist, according to key informant K-3. One key informant explained how her team addressed to the ministry the importance of integrating sexual health at the national level so that cities will integrate it into their local policy. She further discussed that the general attitude of municipalities does not make it easy to find additional financing. Key informant K-3 added, 
 One key informant said the SHCs ask for one’s postal code before making an appointment, which she considered a barrier. Another key informant added, 
 When K-4 was asked whether or not people knew of this fact, she replied, 
 The perceived health status factor referred to HT participant’s perception of their overall health and the influence it has on seeking health services, including HIV testing. If participants had a perceived overall good health status, they were less likely to go to the doctor for any health service. In some cases, sexual behavior was the main reason to visit the doctor. As participant P-9 stated, 
 One of the participants who had never tested for HIV said that if she experienced symptoms of any kind, she would go to the doctor, but would not think it was HIV: 
 The evaluated health status referred to HT participants’ health being assessed by a health professional (i.e., GP or nurse), in relation to going for an HIV test. Only one participant who had tested for HIV with a GP in the Netherlands discussed, 
 Three key informants mentioned there being a lack of HIV testing even with the introduction of indicator-condition guided HIV testing due to its broad nature and GPs being uncertain of when to offer the test. Another key informant (K-5) said, 
 Key informant K-2 mentioned the efforts in trying to remedy this, 
 HT participants and key informants were asked about their suggestions on how to improve HIV testing in the Netherlands among heterosexual migrants. Some HT participants brought up the importance of awareness campaigns, outreach activities, and promotion and normalization of HIV testing (services). All key informants highlighted the need to improve the health literacy of heterosexual migrant groups, particularly men since they tend to enter into HIV care at a later stage due to the difficulty of finding their way into the healthcare system. Many HT participants felt the need to have more free testing services to remove financial barriers. One participant suggested having more HIV testing services available on Saturdays. Also, several HT participants mentioned not having enough available information regarding where to test for HIV. As one pointed out, 
 A key informant corroborated this by saying, 
 A couple of key informants mentioned past interventions that were successful in reaching at-risk groups such as the HIV Transmission Elimination Amsterdam (H-TEAM), and the integration of HIV testing into other health services (e.g., prenatal screening and HIV/STI testing). However, a few key informants mentioned that the integration of HIV testing into STI testing encountered financing issues. See  This study identified factors that contributed to a low uptake of HIV testing services among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands, namely HT participants’ low knowledge of HIV (including where to test), perception of limited accessibility of SHC facilities, insufficient available information on HIV (testing) services, and low perception of HIV risk. Unclear policies and guidelines on accessing HIV/STI testing services at SHCs and missed opportunities for HIV testing at GPs were contributing factors identified by key informants. Low overall knowledge of HIV (including transmission routes and where to test) was present among some HT participants, despite interviews having been conducted after the participants’ HIV test counseling session (with the exception of two persons who had never tested). Despite this, the majority of HT participants believed that HIV testing was of high importance. Furthermore, long-term migrants were not very familiar with the Dutch healthcare system, even less in relation to HIV testing services, despite four being raised or living in the Netherlands since their youth. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors influenced the use of HIV testing services (including repeat testing). The main reasons HT participants tested at AHF Checkpoint were because they provide free, rapid testing, with no appointment required. The cost of HIV testing was seen as a barrier or enabler depending on the context. The free HIV testing service of AHF Checkpoint was an enabling factor that many participants stated when searching for an HIV test. Conversely, some HT participants and key informants mentioned costs at private clinics and GPs being a deterrent to testing for HIV. While an online HIV self-test was mentioned by an HT participant as an alternative to the high costs at private clinics, it was felt that the cost would still be a deterrent for most migrants. The postal code requirement and the SHC’s online appointment system were perceived as barriers by both HT participants and key informants. Key informants explained the challenges that migrants face regarding accessibility to and availability of test services. Interestingly, the participants who had never tested for HIV perceived the accessibility to HIV testing services to be overall good, but also felt that most migrants they know are completely unaware of where to test and of the requirements. Any information on HIV and testing services was mainly accessed on the internet with unavailability of information in multiple languages. Moreover, HT participants came from different countries with varying cultures, and thus had different expectations of care. However, this was more reflected in acquisition of general health services. The issues of accessibility remain a challenge in the Netherlands despite its major cities committed to translating HIV and testing information into multiple languages, and improving the access to this information that goes beyond the conventional methods used by public health institutions, as outlined by the Sevilla Declaration [ HT participants perceived their risk of HIV to be low, which led some to feel that an HIV test was previously unnecessary and others to feel that future HIV testing is needed in cases of unprotected sex. HIV testing was also considered more important for the gay community. However, as mentioned by a key informant, heterosexual men may not consider themselves gay or bisexual despite sexual interactions with other men. Also, some participants perceived condom use and being in a stable relationship as reasons to not test for HIV. As studies in the Netherlands have shown, low risk perception of HIV was more likely among heterosexual migrant men and women, and health providers do not always think about testing for HIV in the presence of HIV indicator conditions when patients are of older age [ Literature on never-before HIV tested heterosexual non-Western migrants in Europe showed the main barriers to testing as being the belief of migrants not being HIV infected and the lack of knowledge of HIV, including where to test (for no or low cost) [ Inter(national) studies have shown that fear of the test result plays a big role in not seeking testing due to perceived consequences of a diagnosis, which include social stigma from communities discovering their result [ While no participants in our study experienced discrimination or stigmatization when trying to access health services (including HIV testing) in the Netherlands, other recent Dutch studies showed the contrary [ A successful initiative to reduce HIV transmission has been the Amsterdam H-TEAM, which uses biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions to reach MSM and people who originate from countries with a high HIV prevalence [ The theoretic (expanded) framework used in this study guided the analysis on the issues raised. The hybrid analysis-approach (deductive and inductive) helped to create and find themes that were not explicitly laid out in the framework. The adaptability of the framework makes it useful in future health service utilization studies, but including the ‘predisposing characteristics’ from the earlier framework alongside the psychosocial factors instead of replacing it is recommended since it would capture more of the e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic and family size issues related to the usage of HIV testing services. In this study, the factors ‘Consumer Satisfaction’ and ‘Personal Health Practices’ were excluded since the former was already reflected in the section on ‘Experience during HIV Test.’ The latter factor was excluded since there was no difference seen between individuals with a healthy or not so healthy lifestyle linked to (ever) testing for HIV. Furthermore, the successful inclusion of heterosexual male participants in this study was also a strength that provided new insight into the (assumed) lesser willingness of heterosexual migrant men to test for HIV. Despite the HIV test counselors on duty being female (with the exception of a male test counselor on one day of data collection), a larger willingness to participate was among males. Data collection from both HT participants and key informants allowed for confirmation of results (data triangulation). We included two people who had never before been tested for HIV and six first-time testers. Different perspectives were obtained through the recruitment of participants from countries with various cultures and religions. Additionally, a variety of key informants from different work backgrounds provided a well-rounded discussion on reasons for late-stage HIV diagnosis among heterosexual migrants. Two key informants, however, were unable to participate in the FGD and provided responses on our questions on paper. Consequently, these key informants were not able to share and exchange experiences with other key informants, which is a limitation. Having a diverse group of HT participants may have also had some limitations, e.g., not always having males and females within each migrant group. Furthermore, convenience sampling in one location in Amsterdam may have affected representativeness of the study, especially since participants from rural areas were not included, potential issues (e.g., distance to SHCs) that were found in Dutch studies did not play a role in our study [ While language was not presented by HT participants as a major barrier, it does not mean that this barrier does not exist. The selection criteria tool was only available in English and Spanish. As a result, there was potential selection bias with migrants either speaking English or Spanish. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of migrant populations, they cannot be seen as one cultural group, which limited the study in focusing on specific migrant sub-groups. Similarly, factors like poverty, employment, and lack of education remain issues in accessing HIV information and testing services, but our participants were relatively well-educated. Moreover, our study was unable to delve into the political aspect of health system financing (except for some statements about a broader involvement of the municipality in providing additional finance for testing) and its influences on the use of health facilities and health providers in providing HIV information and testing services. This study found several factors that pose a barrier to HIV testing among heterosexual migrants in the Netherlands. Psychosocial, enabling, and need factors are key in understanding why and how migrants use HIV testing services, but the inclusion of other components (of the framework) is also crucial in helping to assess inequalities in accessing these services. AHF Checkpoint was considered by HT participants to be a convenient and easily accessible HIV testing facility. Recognizing the importance of all components can guide policy makers in using evidence-informed interventions to improve the access to and availability of HIV information and testing services in the Netherlands. The input received from HT participants and key informants helped create recommendations (Tables  (DOCX) (DOCX)",[],2024-10-9,PLOS ONE,STI
11462721,Female transactional sex workers’ experiences and health-seeking behaviour in low-middle income countries: a scoping review,"For a variety of reasons related to biology, behaviour, and environment, a subset of a population known as female sex workers (FSWs) or female transactional sex workers is at increased risk of health, depression, social stigma and access to timely and quality healthcare when needed. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there was lack of understanding regarding the experiences and healthcare utilisation and behaviours, the health burden among them, their experiences, and how they access health care. Using Anderson’s behavioural model of health service utilisation as a framework, this review aimed to explore the experiences of, and healthcare seeking behaviours of female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries. Six relevant databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1990 and December 2023 that discussed female transactional sex work in low- and middle-income countries. Subject terms such as: low-and middle- incomes, sex workers (female and male), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the sex work industry, prostitution, commercial sex, and health-seeking behaviour were used for the databases search. Out of 6,135 articles that were retrieved for the study, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Of the total number of studies, four were reviews, eight were quantitative studies, six were qualitative studies, and two utilised mixed methods. Results from a thematic analysis of studies that combined quantitative and qualitative methods yielded six overarching themes.The study found that women engaged in sex work for different reasons – to fend for themselves (i.e., livelihood), self-employment and others do it for pleasure. However, force sex or unprotected which can lead to sexually transmitted infections, sexual abuse, job insecurity, were critical risks factors in engaging in sex work. These factors make them vulnerable to predators and health risks. It was found that sex workers were aware of the importance of seeking healthcare, and do make the efforts, however, crucial factors such as difficulty accessing healthcare and maltreatment by healthcare providers and social stigma disincentivises FSW health-seeking behaviours. Sexual workers reported discomfort disclosing their occupations because of the stigma and discrimination which further affects their regular health examinations and obtaining medically approved condoms from healthcare facilities. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare afflict female sex workers in LMICs. The maltreatment and stigma can potentially affect LMICs from achieving using health facility care, with potential implications on achieving the universal health coverage goals. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs."," Female transactional sexual behaviour is associated with public health problems worldwide and presents many conceptual challenges for researchers [ The health and well-being of female sex workers (FSWs) are greatly impacted by a number of issues and vulnerabilities that are specific to the profession in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, FSW in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should not be overlooked as a minor aspect of the social and economic crisis. Governments are becoming more aware of the problems and dangers faced by sex workers and their health-seeking activities [ In addition, the environment in which FSWs conduct their business often vary and with different experiences, thereof. According to a qualitative study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, FSWs meet clients online as well as in real-world settings like venues and outdoor areas. Due to the criminalisation of their profession, the women involved reported experiencing severe stigma, assault from customers and authorities, and difficulties getting access to healthcare. Those who used online venues faced extra dangers, including extortion and cybersecurity threats [ In urban versus rural settings, FSWs may have very different experiences. Though there is more competition and violence in urban areas; therefore, FSWs may have better access to clients and services [ However, the universal health coverage (UHC) principles are widely championed because a population’s healthcare-seeking behaviour (HSB) has a major impact on a country’s health status and, as a result, socioeconomic growth [ It includes factors such as the type of provider, adherence to treatment, reasons for choosing a professional, and reasons for not seeking help. The environment’s characteristics significantly influence individuals’ decisions to seek healthcare, with specific characteristics determining their HSBs [ The literature has shown that many FSWs face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, preferring informal providers due to fear of stigma and discrimination. Studies show that up to 70% of FSWs avoid public health facilities due to discrimination, stigma and mistreatment concerns [ This review draws on Anderson’s model of health-seeking behaviour Fig.  Health service utilization model. Source: Adapted from Saah; Andersen and Davidson [ Thus, this study aim to explore their sex work experiences and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of female sex work in LMICs, addressing the unique challenges faced by sex workers. It highlights the complexities of healthcare utilization and the social, economic, and security threats to their livelihoods, thereby enabling the development of public health efforts and interventions [ To find relevant research, this review conducted a comprehensive mapping of studies that focused on commercial or transactional sex work and the health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) of female sex workers. The following steps proposed by Arksey and O’Malley’s [ These searches were conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, the author conducted a thorough search for non-traditional sources of information, as well as examined the reference lists of all relevant studies that were found, in order to uncover any more research papers that align with our search criteria [ A systematic search was conducted on published literature within these popular databases in the field health, psychology and social sciences. The following keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were combined in the searches: “transactional sex work” OR “commercial sex work” “prostitute” OR “prostitution” OR “sex work” OR “sex worker” OR “female sex workers” OR “STIs” OR “health-seeking behavior” AND “low-middle income countries”. The study included studies published between 1990 and 2023. This was the period within which discussions on HIV/AIDS and STIs’ among female sex workers became prominent in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa [ Relevant components of the study aims, methods used and the findings were extracted and summarised. Out of 6,347 articles found using the database and manual search, 1,215 made it through the title and abstract screening process after duplicates were removed. After the screening, 202 studies were considered eligible for assessment, and 22 studies were ultimately selected after triangulation by three (3) separate reviewers. The final tally for the papers included in the analysis was 26 after screening and adding 3 prior review studies (Fig.  
 PRISMA flow diagram adopted for studies included in this systematic scoping review: Study identification, screening, exclusions and final inclusions after assessing studies full texts (Page et al., 2021) The relevant information in the articles used in the study were independently extracted, examined, and synthesised relative to the experiences and healthcare-seeking behaviours of FSWs. Three colleagues with advanced expertise in review studies were engaged to assess and triangulate the findings obtained from the summaries of the findings, focusing on factors that resonate with the study’s objective. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained and presented using narrative synthesis to understand the factors [ The twenty-six articles included were published between 1990 and 2022 of which twelve articles were published in 2012, 2013 and 2015 [

 Summary of mapped studies included in the systematic scoping review 
 Summary of Factors 
 Summary of Factors Affecting Health Seeking Behaviour (HSB) of prostitutes Demographics and socioeconomic variables commonly identified and discussed in these studies included age, marital status, level of education, family background, ethnicity, religious backgrounds and poverty. In 80.8% ( In 19 (73.1%) studies participants identified factors that led them to female transactional sex work. FSWs indicated that the primary factor influencing their decisions to work in the area of commercial sex was that, they were from poor financial background, had no job, did not have any identifiable sources of income and found it difficult to fend for themselves [ Respondents in other studies involving FSWs in Nigeria and others in public Universities in Ghana, provided a list of reasons for entering into the sex work industry that extended beyond money or material benefits. A subset of participants in the study provided the following explanations:  From the analysis, female sex workers (FSWs) revealed that the majority of male clients exhibit resistance in regards to condom usage prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. The vulnerability of younger sex workers was heightened by their inexperience and lack of proficiency in bargaining, leading to difficulties in advocating for condom use during sexual encounters. FSWs also mentioned issues of vulnerability to extortion by state security personnel such as Police Officers, who sometimes would abuse sex workers physically, and demand unprotected sex. Most cultures in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) frown upon transactional sex work. Thus, sex workers commonly reported discomfort discussing their profession, accessing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing, and when they need approved and affordable condoms from the local health clinics [ Several studies have revealed dangers associated with violence or sexual assault perpetrated by clients. The circumstances that are thought to increase the vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to violence include visiting a client’s residence, engaging in nocturnal sessions, and meeting unfamiliar individuals at unknown locations [ The iteration of the results show that FSWs visit drinking bars and night clubs in and around urban areas at night in search of customers, whilst others operate in rented rooms (i.e. hotels, guest houses, and brothels). There were other categories such as those who provide escort services to clients. These categories are highly paid female sex work and involve sexual encounters by appointment with an exclusive client. Such FSWs leave their mobile phone contacts and pictures in hotels and guest houses in, and around their respective areas of operations, to be contacted by prospective customers in Mainland China, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria and similar LMICs [ Studies maintain that once they are selling sex, they are also trying to avoid abuse from clients and law enforcement agencies, such Police Officers. It was found that FSWs sought love and to build a future. Therefore, FSW indulge in romantic relationships with young men without prior medical screening for health status including sexually transmitted infections [ Analysis of factors influencing health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) was based on Andersen’s behavioural model of healthcare utilisation [ Andersen indicates that although predisposing and enabling factors are necessary for health service utilisation, they are not sufficient explanations for “actual use” of healthcare. “Actual use” is initiated by need, which might arise as a result of level of the health condition [ In this study, enabling factors at the female sex worker (FSW) level included wealth and income at the her disposal to cover the cost of assuming positive health-related lifestyles such as good nutrition, physical exercising, wearing of condom, engaging in other safe sex practices and good personal hygiene [ At the individual FSWs level, the model differentiates between perceived need for health services, which refers to how individuals perceive and experience their own health status (such as self-rated health, functional state, and illness symptoms), evaluated need, which involves objective measurements of FSWs’ health status, health screening, and need for health care [ The enhanced healthcare seeking behaviour among FSWs can be attributed to their apprehension of developing the intricate type of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their increased awareness about health, as shown in studies in Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and other LMICs [ Two articles reported that women engaged in street-based sex work, whether separated or married, were more likely to seek health services from clinics or hospitals, when compared to those who were not or never married [ The study aimed to synthesize existing findings on female sex workers experiences, survival strategies, and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. The findings revealed that female sex workers had a high level of formal education, were primarily between the ages of 12 and 35, were either gainfully employed in other sectors or unemployed, and had financial needs. Female sex workers (FSWs) who were married or separated showed an increased likelihood of seeking healthcare. However, FSWs faced challenges in seeking healthcare due to derogatory and discriminatory behaviours towards them, high healthcare fees, and discrimination and maltreatment from providers. Generally, the majority of women involved in transactional sex work experience various degrees of vulnerability. Thus, FSWs’ increased awareness of health concerns and their desire to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) motivated them to seek healthcare. Some FSWs engaged in the act to earn a living, while others primarily engaged in sex work for the fun of it. The majority of the studies examined indicate that most women engaged in sex work at the age of 12 or older had received some level of formal education. These women faced a lack of opportunities to earn income, and many considered dropping out of school as a pivotal moment in their lives, which aligns with existing literature [ First, male clients’ non-adherence and prioritisation of heath protection. Crucial concerns of their health was high, due to clients’ refusal, and deliberate uncooperative attitude towards condom usage during sexual service provision, and incidents of violence. It is worth noting that clients’ refusal to cherish and use sexual protection was closely linked to ‘power and control imbalances’ in the transactional sex work business, as well as the ‘terms’ of ‘contract’ between commercial sex workers and their male clients. From the results, the male clientele tends to exert more dominance in the entire negotiation process. In this context, the use of condoms during transactional sexual interactions is an essential aspect. A quick scan of the literature demonstrates that unprotected sex exposes the lives of FSWs and their clients, to STIs including HIV. Indeed, there was high HIV prevalence in the sex work industry. For example, in 2012, the World Bank report on the health of sex workers showed that across all regions, HIV prevalence was 11.8%, and 36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa, with Malawi (70.7%), South Africa (59.6%), Kenya (45.1%), Rwanda (24.0%) [ Second, health and bodily security were crucial findings from literature. The findings have shown that FSWs were susceptible to multiple problems of health risks, violence and physical harm. Indeed, concerns relative to sexual violence, rape, condom failure, and instances of police officers’ misconduct, were mentioned. These led to concerns of anxiety about contracting HIV through rape and unprotected sex [ Female sex workers faced multiple human rights violations. The results have shown that issues of discrimination and class concerns existed and how women’s bodies were turned into commodities for distinct ulterior motives. Indeed, increased criminalization and social stigmatisation, potentially leading to further discrimination from health providers, hindered their access and utilisation of health facility care [ Finally, the study found that FSWs felt compelled to use healthcare, aligning with Andersen’s healthcare usage model. In nearly all of the included articles, FSWs showed increased health awareness and self-reported health screening in locations such as Mainland China [ Key strength of the study stems from its geographical coverage and the wide duration which allowed saturation of data on the themes. The study also included articles from The study was guided by Anderson’s healthcare utilisation model; meanwhile different frameworks were used to analyse female sex workers experiences and health seeking behaviours in the included studies. The subject investigated has cultural and health implications, and thus, the non-inclusion of cultural nuances in the search may have left out relevant articles. However, given the saturation of the findings in the themes, it is believed, additional articles may only support what has been found. Despite the novel findings presented in this study, they must be read against the backdrop of the following limitations. The review investigates the experiences of female sex workers, and their health-seeking behaviours in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it does not (and cannot) address all of the concerns with geographical distinctiveness in low- and middle-income countries in one study. Further, some articles were not available in full text or freely accessible via search engines for inclusion in the data set. However, the anticipated effect of non-access to the full texts, which are less likely to be published in low impact factor journals, may be to add only a number of supporting articles to the already established themes. Finally, female sex work has shifted from traditional brothel-based sex work to internet-based sex work and a mix of different types, over the last years. The vulnerabilities faced by women in sex work depend on the type of sex work they are engaged in, whether it’s brothel-based, street-based, massage parlour-based, internet-based, or other forms of transactional sex. However, this study could not explore these nuances, which has limited the conclusions relative to the vulnerabilities across the broad spectrum of female sex work. This study recommends further studies in these areas for policy, social intervention and health programming. The review’s findings validate several notions outlined in Anderson’s health seeking model, specifically that socio-demographic factors like education, occupation (particularly sex work), and the effectiveness of medications or pharmaceuticals are inadequate for determining the utilisation of conventional healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, the utilisation of orthodox health facilities by FSWs was not significantly influenced by age or marital status. The study also discovered a noteworthy relationship between the vocation of sex work and the practice of self-medication. Variables such as age, education, marital status, work status, and work experience did not show a significant correlation with self-medication from the literature. The findings have shown that female sex work in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents complex policy challenges with significant implications for public health, human rights, and social welfare. Overall, policies regarding female sex work in LMICs should prioritize the rights, health, and well-being of sex workers while addressing the broader social, economic, and structural factors that shape their experiences. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare services was found to negatively impact female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was found that female sex work was motivated by the need to earn living although others engaged in the business for the love it. Nevertheless, FSWs were exposed to multiple risks of sexually transmitted infections, threats of sexual and physical violence against them, as well as human rights violations from clients and law enforcement agencies. Indeed, access to health facility for healthcare become problematic due to discrimination and stigma by healthcare providers. The maltreatment and stigma meted to FSWs, potentially inhibits their health outcomes, the countries attainment of universal health coverage goals, and without access to care for FSWs, HIV could become an endemic health problem. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs. Furthermore, to address the factors relative to healthcare seeking behaviours of FSWs, there is an urgent wake-up call to ensure comprehensive, non-discriminatory, and accessible healthcare is available to improve their healthcare utilisation.","['Commercial sex work', 'Prostitution', 'Transactional sex', 'Low-middle income countries']",2024-10-9,BMC Public Health,STI
11462516,Microstimulation-based path tracking control of pigeon robots through parameter adaptive strategy,"Research on animal robots utilizing neural electrical stimulation is a significant focus within the field of neuro-control, though precise behavior control remains challenging. This study proposes a parameter-adaptive strategy to achieve accurate path tracking. First, the mapping relationship between neural electrical stimulation parameters and corresponding behavioral responses is comprehensively quantified. Next, adjustment rules related to the parameter-adaptive control strategy are established to dynamically generate different stimulation patterns. A parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy (PAPTCS), based on fuzzy control principles, is designed for the precise path tracking tasks of pigeon robots in open environments. The results indicate that altering stimulation parameter levels significantly affects turning angles, with higher UPN and PTN inducing changes in the pigeons' motion state. In experimental scenarios, the average control efficiency of this system was 82.165%. This study provides a reference method for the precise control of pigeon robot behavior, contributing to research on accurate target path tracking.","The evolution of microelectronics and biomedical technology has given rise to a distinct category of animal robots, diverging from traditional robots. In this paradigm, animals replace mechanical structures, and neuroelectric stimulation serves as a control command transmitted to the sensory or motor cortex, enabling the manipulation of specific behaviors. This synthesis capitalizes on the inherent locomotion capabilities of animals while addressing energy supply challenges [ Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing passive stimulation modalities to target specific motor brain areas in pigeons, thereby controlling distinct motions [ Current neuroregulation methods include deep brain stimulation (DBS) [ Research on the behavioral regulation of bio-robots has demonstrated that organisms can respond to deep brain stimulation patterns to perform specific movements. It has been observed across different species that the success rate of behavior control can be significantly enhanced by flexibly configuring stimulation parameters. Additionally, it has been proven that external information, when encoded through electrical stimulation and transmitted to motor execution brain regions, can reliably induce behavioral responses. While neuroelectric stimulation can be used for encoding sensory information that the central nervous system translates into corresponding motor outputs, excessive electrical stimulation may compromise the effectiveness of behavioral responses and lead to neuronal inactivation [ Previous studies on the optimal stimulation parameters and patterns for controlling the movement of pigeon robots have indicated that the integration of multiple pulse modes is more effective in meeting the complex demands of animal behavior control. However, these studies have not accounted for the varying rotational requirements at different moments during the control task, which can lead to overcorrection and cause the subject to sway back and forth along the target path, resulting in an ""8"" path. In recent years, this issue has been addressed by adjusting stimulation patterns to guide and control rat robots in performing corresponding movements and successfully developing an autonomous navigation system for rat robots [ Therefore, establishing a real-time parameter-adaptive control algorithm is essential for accomplishing complex path tracking tasks in pigeon robots. Addressing the limitations of single stimulation mode control, which fails to meet the adaptive requirements of dynamic systems, this paper proposes a parameter-adaptive control strategy for pigeon robot path tracking. A feedback control system based on fuzzy control principles has been designed to enable precise tracking of target paths by pigeon robots in open environments. To implement this autonomous control system, the movement state must first be detected. This involves using target region segmentation techniques to locate the pigeon robot and calculate real-time position errors and their trends. Next, by analyzing the mapping relationship between parameter levels and behavioral responses, a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy is formulated. Finally, output parameters are dynamically adjusted based on the control requirements at different stages of the task, with diverse stimulation modes employed to achieve precise and prolonged control of pigeon behavior. The proposed parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategydemonstrated exceptional navigation performance in a bidirectional open-field environment. In this study, seven adult pigeons (Ph1, Ph2, Ph3, Ph5, Ph7, Ph9, Ph10) with an average age of 2 ± 0.3 years and a body weight exceeding 400 g were selected. Both male and female pigeons were included. The pigeons were housed individually in wire cages under normal light-dark conditions, with free access to water, nutrient-rich soil, and a mixed diet. All animal experiments described in this paper were reviewed and approved by the Life Sciences Ethics Review Committee of Zhengzhou University (No. SYXK 2019–0002), in compliance with the guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A bidirectional open test field, measuring 2.7 × 1.8 m, was used in this study, as shown in  Experimental model design and pigeon robots. (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental site. (b) Experiment with a pigeon robot wearing a wireless neurostimulator. (c) Wireless neurostimulator. (d) Electrode converter PCB circuit diagram. The neuromodulation phase is preceded by 3–5 days of forward training. Pigeons underwent a period of food deprivation exceeding 24 h, and water, food, and nutrient soil were positioned at the end of the field. The feeding site served for rationing, with 2 g of food administered at a time. Upon their initial arrival at the feeding site, pigeons were relocated to the starting point. During this phase, they foraged and returned to the starting point undisturbed. This pre-training process instills in them the motivation to walk forward. This training methodology proves highly effective in control experiments, as it allows the animals to return to the starting point undisturbed, thus minimizing stress from external factors and enhancing their capacity for autonomous decision-making. First, the pigeons were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium pentobarbital (0.14 ml/100 g). Once the anesthesia took effect, the feathers on the head were shaved, and 2% lidocaine (0.2–0.3 ml) was administered subcutaneously for local anesthesia. The pigeons were then secured in a specially designed stereotaxic apparatus (Model 68027, RWD Life Sciences, Shenzhen, China), and the FRM region (AP: 3.90 mm, ML: 1.45 mm, DP: 8.0 mm) was selected as the implantation site based on the pigeon brain atlas (Karten and Hodos, 1967). The brain region is illustrated in  Schematic of FRM Brain Region Stimulation Electrode Implantation. (a) Anatomical diagram of the pigeon brain. (b) Localization of the FRM brain region. The wireless neural stimulator from the literature reference [ The stimulator output pulse was configured as a biphasic constant-current square wave with cathodic precession, maintaining a total charge output of zero. This design aimed to alleviate the adverse effects of DC stimulation on the target nucleus, ensuring that bi-directional pulses did not introduce charge bias within or outside the neuronal membrane [ Neuroelectrical stimulation initiates a firing response in neurons through the delivery of an external electrical charge to the designated brain area, eliciting a shift in membrane potential. Neuroactivity is contingent on the cumulative charge imparted to the neural tissue, a value influenced by pulse parameters, stimulation modes, together with the electrode materials and implantation locations. Current research indicates that both higher stimulation intensity and longer stimulation duration have a greater impact on pigeon behavior, while more frequent single stimulations result in increased damage to brain tissue. Based on these findings, the primary stimulation parameters used in this study, as illustrated in  PF: Defined as the number of pulse signal cycle changes per second, expressed as PF = 1/T, where T represents the time of the unit pulse cycle. UPN: Refers to the quantity of unit pulses within a unit pulse sequence. PTN: Indicates the count of unit pulses within a pulse sequence. PA: Denotes the peak value of current per unit pulse.

(b) Flow chart of pigeon motion status recognition based on HSV color space method. (c) Calculation method of rotation angle and motion distance. The black arrow represents the current body direction of the pigeon, the angle between the hollow arrows is the steering angle before and after electrical stimulation, and the distance between the center of gravity of the pigeon's body is the travel distance before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we set the duty cycle ( Parameter conditions used for experiments on the relationship between parameter levels and behavioral responses. All experiments quantifying the behavioral responses to stimulation parameters were conducted using the method of controlling variables. The increments for stimulation parameters were 25 Hz for frequency, 1 pulse for UPN, 1 train for PTN, and 0.1 mA for amplitude. To ensure the robustness of the behavioral control study, parameters that reliably induced behavior were established as initial values. The initial stimulation parameters, determined from post-surgical verification experiments, were 50 Hz for frequency, 4 pulses for UPN, 3 trains for PTN, and 0.2 mA for amplitude. To minimize the impact of sequential increments on statistical analysis, a pseudorandom sequence was used to determine the order of testing parameters. Each test focused on the effect of a single parameter on behavior, with neural stimulation repeated 10 times in the FRM brain regions of both the left and right sides of all subjects to ensure the reproducibility of behavioral induction. To ensure the robustness of the behavioral control study, the parameters that could stabilize the evoked behavior were established as the initial values. The initial stimulation parameters derived from postoperative locus validity experiments were determined to be 0.2 mA, 50 Hz, 4 sizes, and 3 strings. All experiments were conducted using the controlled variable method and employed biphasic constant current pulse stimulation. The PF, UPN, PTN, and PA were then randomized for adjustment, with unit increments of 0.1 mA, 25 Hz, 1 size, and 1 string, respectively. Each set of trials focused on a single parameter and was repeated 10 times in both the right and left FRM of all subjects to ensure the reproducibility of effects. To mitigate the impact of sequence increment on statistical analysis results, a pseudo-randomized sequence was used to determine the order of the tested parameters. Accurate and efficient detection methods will enhance the operational efficiency of the online control system. In this paper, we employ the HSV-based color space to extract the motion state of the pigeon robot [ To assess the significance among different parameter levels inducing rotation behaviors (as presented in  Each parameter level was iterated 10 times in both the left and right brain areas of each subject. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to explore variances between individual rotation behaviors and parameter settings, with the significance level set at 5% (∗, p < 0.05). LSD post hoc analysis was employed to examine the impact of parameter level selection on rotation behavior [ Pigeons can autonomously determine their behavior based on the environmental context. Pigeons usually exhibit specific behaviors by their inherent motion patterns, deviating from our expectations if the deviation from the target path is not suppressed. Consequently, the automatic navigation system of animal robots exhibits significant randomness. The use of a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy allows for pre-adjustment of the pigeon's motion path. This helps in restraining impending transgressions or instances of control loss during the tracking. Furthermore, it will avoid path fluctuations caused by system hysteresis control. The fuzzy control algorithm does not rely on an accurate model of the controlled system and is capable of managing uncertain systems. Using this method, a path tracking control system for the pigeon robot was established, as illustrated in  Pigeon robot path tracking control system and strategy. (a) Design block diagram of pigeon robot path tracking control system. (b) parameter adaptive path tracking control strategy control rule. The positional information ( To prevent tolerance development due to frequent electrical stimulation, errors within the pigeon's body width ( When  When | To comprehensively assess the control strategy's performance, two parameters are defined. The task-averaged error rate α evaluates the accuracy of the control strategy in tracking the target path, while the control efficiency η assesses the system's effectiveness in successful experimental trials. An efficiency level ( Statistical evaluation of system repeatability in multi-individual, multi-trial experiments is performed through the control efficiency ( Rapidity requirement:  Accuracy requirement:  The task is deemed successful when both conditions are met; otherwise, it is considered a failure. The duration taken to stabilize the foraging route during pre-training was recorded as the freely foraging time ( In this section, we analyze the impact of varied parameters on the motion behavior of pigeons within a two-way open field. Simultaneously, we discuss the tracking performance of the automatic control system. Our objective is to achieve the autonomous tracking of the pigeon robot along a predefined path in an open-field scenario and enhance tracking accuracy through PAPTCS. To ensure experiment reliability, pigeons undergo a fasting period exceeding 12 h before any test, ensuring their predominant forward momentum originates from food. Following each test, the experimental site undergoes meticulous cleaning, ventilation, and a half-hour drying period before subsequent experiments. The experiment successfully collected data from five pigeon robots, with the results illustrated in  Impact of PF/Hz on RA and TD Behavioral responses of individual subjects to different levels of stimulation parameters. As the frequency increased from 25 Hz to 100 Hz, RA on the left side decreased from 144.55° to 77.52°, while TD decreased from 8.39 cm to 6.65 cm. A similar decreasing trend was observed on the right side, where RA decreased from 103.45° to 49.76° and TD from 10.26 cm to 6.57 cm. The increase in frequency led to a reduction in both RA and TD, suggesting that high-frequency stimulation may suppress the pigeon's response. Although the trends on both sides were similar, the RA and TD on the right side were smaller than those on the left. A strong positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on the left side (r = 0.89), but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.11, p > 0.05). On the right side, a very significant positive correlation was found between RA and TD (r = 0.99, p = 0.013, p < 0.05), indicating a higher level of synchronization under frequency variations. Impact of UPN/Size on RA and TD As the number of unit pulses increased from Size 3 to 6, both RA and TD increased on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 79.49° to 175.87°, and TD increased from 6.12 cm to 10.12 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 60.92° to 153.14°, and TD from 6.74 cm to 13.44 cm. Although RA on the right side was slightly lower than on the left side, the increase in TD was more pronounced, indicating a more significant impact of pulse quantity on the right side. A strong positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on the left side (r = 0.92), but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.081, p > 0.05). On the right side, the positive correlation was stronger and significant (r = 0.97, p = 0.033, p < 0.05). Impact of PTN/String on RA and TD As the number of pulse trains increased from 2 to 5, both RA and TD increased on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 74.82° to 199.35°, and TD increased from 6.21 cm to 10.03 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 56.84° to 144.76°, and TD from 6.99 cm to 12.82 cm. A very strong and significant positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on both sides (Left: r = 0.95, p = 0.047; Right: r = 0.98, p = 0.021), indicating that the trend of influence due to the number of pulse trains is consistent across both sides, with a greater magnitude of change on the right side. Impact of PA/mA on RA and TD With increasing amplitude, both RA and TD showed significant increases on both sides. On the left side, RA increased from 8.48° to 189.27°, and TD from 0 cm to 15.77 cm. On the right side, RA increased from 0° (no response) to 172.72°, and TD from 0.94 cm to 15.33 cm. A very strong and highly significant positive correlation between RA and TD was observed on both sides (Left: r = 0.99, p = 0.007; Right: r = 0.99, p = 0.011), demonstrating that changes in amplitude can precisely control the pigeon's motor responses. Next, a detailed analysis of the relationship between stimulation parameters and behavioral responses will be provided using the Ph2 individual as an example. A detailed analysis is provided using stimulation of the left FRM brain region in the Ph2 individual as an example. Results of pigeon motion and behavior stimulated by different parameters. The extent of motion response in pigeons exhibited a direct correlation with the stimulus parameters, as illustrated in  The degree to which different stimulus parameters changed the locomotion state of pigeons. (a, b, c) Represent rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PF, respectively. (d, e, f) Represent rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter UPN, respectively. (g, h, i) Represent the rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PTN. (j, k, l) Represent the rotation Angle, motion distance, and behavioral response under different levels of stimulus parameter PA, respectively. The thick black lines in Figs. j, k, and l indicate that all trials are generated stably; the rectangular boxes indicate the range of state switching for all trials. Note: ∗ indicates that there is significance between the two (∗, p < 0.05). ▲ represents that the pigeon switches from a stationary state to a walking state at the end of the motion; ⚪ represents that the pigeon responds quickly and moves rapidly; ★ represents that the pigeon loses its body balance at the end of the motion. It was observed that the parameters UPN and PTN significantly influenced the RA ( PA exhibited a positive correlation with both RA and TD. In contrast to the other parameters, PA displayed a distinctive “threshold"" for behavior control, beyond which the pigeon robot initiated behavioral responses. Notably, both RA and TD showed significant increases at PA = 0.3, with angular increments strongly correlated with PA increments ( The average success rate across the five individuals was 78%, with Ph2 achieving the highest success rate of 90%, while Ph10 had a success rate of 60%.  The results of trial 2 for pigeon Ph7 are depicted in  The tracking effect of PAPTCS on complex paths. (a) Path tracking effect of successful trial 2. (b) Path tracking effect of successful trial 5. (c) Path tracking effect on failed trials, accuracy did not meet system design requirements. (d) Path tracking effect on failed trials, rapidity did not meet system design requirements. Task failure can arise from two scenarios. The first one is depicted in  Another scenario is depicted in  Number of crossing times of the second route. Note: The first two out of ten experiments of the pigeon robot Ph1 were failed attempts, so only attempts 3–10 were counted. The system output parameters for the test 6 are detailed in  Variable parameter control policy parameter. Note: The bolded portion of the table shows the state quantities and neuromodulation pulse parameters of the pigeon robot in the Path 2 section. Performance indexes of parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy. Note: The reasons for experimental failures are highlighted in bold italics within the table, and the failed trials are marked in red font. Different from the drawbacks associated with the optimal parameter control method, which may result in excessive control of the pigeon robot, the control strategy proposed in this paper anticipates the pigeon robot's motion trend in the subsequent moment through the incorporation of the error rate of change  The performance indicators of Ph1 are illustrated in  Performance indicators of the control system. ANOVA conducted on successful trials yielded non-significant differences between the control efficiency (p = 0.675, ANOVA) and the task average error rate (p = 0.692, ANOVA). These results suggest that an increase in the number of trials did not influence control performance. However, a noteworthy inter-individual significant difference emerged in task completion time (p = 0.036, ANOVA), highlighting a discernible individual effect on the task completion time for the tracking task. Electrical stimulation methods targeting sensory or motor brain areas are widely employed for the automatic control of animal robots. However, a challenge lies in dynamically selecting optimal stimulation parameters. To address this issue, this study proposes a parameter-adaptive path tracking control strategy for pigeon robots. Through the exploration of multiple sets of parameter levels, we identify combinations with minimal charge accumulation, thereby enhancing the overall stability of the control system. Notably, previous studies on automatic control of path tracking in animal robots lack research regarding parameter adaptation. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of research on the control of pigeon robots in open scenarios utilizing parameter adaptive control strategies. In pursuit of a stable, efficient, and enduring path tracking control system for pigeon robots, a comprehensive examination of various parameter levels and stimulus pattern combinations is imperative. This study systematically delves into and delineates the mapping relationship connecting independent variables of parameters to dependent variables of behavior. Subsequently, this mapping relationship is harnessed to devise adaptive strategies for parameter design. Physiological studies on animals have demonstrated that lower stimulus frequencies are ineffective in activating neurons for excitation, while an appropriate frequency range induces behavioral responses in motor neurons [ Generally, an escalation in PTN and UPN is associated with a concurrent rise in the number of directly activated neurons, likely contributing to the pronounced increase in RA and TD in the pigeon robot. Electrophysiological investigations have consistently demonstrated that the level of neuron activation is contingent upon the total effective charge applied to the brain [ Biological responses triggered by electrical nerve stimulation are intricately associated with the phenomenon of neuronal depolarization. The cathodic precursor's stimulus pulse waveform induces an efflux of intracellular positive charge, diminishing the cell membrane potential and prompting neural tissue excitation. External electrical stimulation, for inducing neural excitation, necessitates a pulse amplitude surpassing the action potential's minimum threshold. The action thresholds of all individuals, except for the Ph2 right FRM, exceeded 0.2 mA in this study. Following initial stimulation, cells rapidly enter an excited state, with their excitability enduring for a defined duration [ In the behavioral analysis of the pigeon robots, significant variations in rotation angles were observed among different stimulus parameter levels and, in specific instances (e.g., UPN and PA parameters of Ph1), between travel distances. This outcome indicates that the FRM predominantly performs neural activities associated with body rotation, with alterations in travel distance representing a consequential adaptation to body rotation. Notably, a majority of individuals ( Under the experimental conditions, a strong positive correlation between RA (rotation angle) and TD (travel distance) was observed for both the left and right sides. This indicates that as stimulation parameters increase RA, TD also increases correspondingly, and vice versa. Overall, the correlation on the right side was found to be stronger and more significant compared to the left side (with right-side correlation coefficients exceeding 0.95 and p-values less than 0.05 across all experimental conditions), suggesting that individual behavioral responses under right-side stimulation are more consistent. In the frequency adjustment experiments, the correlation between RA and TD was significant on the right side (r = 0.99, p = 0.013), while a strong correlation was observed on the left side but was not statistically significant (r = 0.89, p = 0.11). In experiments involving the number of pulses (UPN/Size) and pulse trains (PTN/String), both sides exhibited significant positive correlations, particularly on the right side (r > 0.95), indicating that these parameters have a consistent impact on motor behavior across both sides. The effect of amplitude (PA/mA) variations on RA and TD showed a very strong correlation on both sides (r > 0.98, p < 0.05), with a particularly strong correlation on the left side (r = 0.99, p = 0.007), demonstrating that amplitude variations can precisely control the individual's motor responses. The outcomes of this study align with observations from the rat robot, wherein animals exhibited abrupt rotation motions in response to high-amplitude stimuli. The animals concluded their response within a duration of 3–4s following stimulus application. After the cessation of the stimulus pulse, neurons gradually returned to the resting state within a timeframe of 1.5–2.5s [ Stimulation patterns exert a direct influence on the extent of motion response and the transition between behavioral states in pigeon robots. The animal motor conditioning system selectively engages distinct functional subareas of the FRM and specific motor neural pathways to accommodate rotation requirements in varying rotation scenarios. The wireless neurostimulator generates diverse neuromodulation pulses targeting the designated brain area. This diversity in stimulation modes serves to prolong the brain's tolerance, ensuring sustained system efficacy over the long term. Furthermore, it enhances the system's capacity to control pigeon behavior [ Overall, the behavioral patterns of the five individuals under different stimulation conditions showed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that the research results are both replicable and reliable. The stable patterns observed across different stimulation parameters provide a solid foundation for further development of neural control systems. To attain a specific control objective, the design of diverse stimulus patterns is imperative to concurrently elicit desired physiological responses, such as inducing visual perception, generating limbic behaviors, or facilitating a specific task. These responses manifest externally and internally, characterized by factors such as the rate of activation, the volume of activated tissues, and the duration. Effective control over these effects is achievable through the control of microelectrical stimulation parameters. Traditionally, optimal stimulation parameters are selected as the control system output based on an individual's response characteristics to pulse parameters. However, this approach fails to meet the precise control requirements for tracking the target path during the system's operation. The primary reason is that biological behavior is influenced by multiple factors, resulting in a non-linear relationship between parameters and behavioral responses, with significant variations among individuals. Additionally, path tracking is a highly dynamic and real-time task that demands the control system to possess self-adjusting capabilities. Fuzzy control principles can simulate the response of different individuals to parameters and generate stimulation patterns that meet the real-time requirements for precise path tracking. This approach allows for pre-control of boundary behaviors, resulting in smoother trajectories for the pigeon robots and preventing the occurrence of ""8"" paths. The results of this study reveal that the control success rate exceeds 80% for most individuals, except for individual Ph10, and notably achieving 90% for Ph2. The average error rate in experiments is predominantly below 50%, highlighting the impracticality of pursuing full controllability akin to mechanical robots for animal counterparts like pigeon robots, which possess intrinsic cognitive processes. The design of control strategies for animal robots should align with the external environment of creatures and intentions. Moreover, the average control efficiencies in experiments consistently fall within the efficient control range, reaching an impressive 93.1577% for Ph7. This indicates that the behavioral decisions of the pigeon robot can be effectively influenced through applied neuroelectric stimulation, facilitating the execution of desired actions and the successful accomplishment of tasks specified by human operators. In contrast to prior investigations [ The difficulty of the control process may be influenced by multiple factors. Research indicates that an individual's age and cognitive level can affect behavioral responses. In studies on locusts, older locusts typically respond more quickly to threats than younger ones, which helps to explain instances of control failure observed in the early stages of experiments [ Using controllable biological robots for biological research enables the simulation of most scenarios required by researchers while avoiding the species rejection responses commonly encountered in mechanical robot simulations. This approach is of significant importance for a deeper understanding of animal social interactions, spatial cognition, and navigation [ This study also promotes interdisciplinary research across fields such as biology, robotics, biomedicine, and environmental science. For instance, robotic rehabilitation systems enable precise control to deliver repetitive motion training while minimizing human error. Neurostimulation technologies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), directly activate the nervous system to facilitate neurorepair and neuroplasticity, aiding in the recovery of motor function. Combining neurostimulation with robotic rehabilitation allows for dynamic adjustment of therapeutic parameters based on patient needs, enhancing the effectiveness of personalized rehabilitation [ Additionally, the use of controllable biological robots in biological research enables the simulation of most experimental scenarios while avoiding the species rejection reactions often encountered in mechanical robot simulations. This approach also reduces the uncertainty and variability introduced by live animals in traditional experiments, thereby improving the reproducibility and accuracy of research[ Neural electrical stimulation offers significant advantages in controlling animal robots, providing essential technical means for research in animal robot behavior control. This study validates the feasibility of the pigeon robot path tracking control system from a system design perspective and demonstrates the system's effectiveness on the ground. In the design of automatic control systems for flight-capable biological robots, although strategies for controlling specific behaviors through the intervention of pigeon intentions have been successfully implemented in laboratory settings, external environmental effects on pigeon movement intentions have not been considered due to the limited number of experiments and individual differences. Additionally, there is a lack of feedback mechanisms related to the awareness of the biological entities. Future research should focus on integrating the intrinsic behavioral intentions of animals with human interventions to design more effective control systems at the level of animal intentions. Additionally, due to the inherent challenges in interpreting subjective experiences of animals, humans typically rely on observable behaviors and physiological responses to assess emotional expression. Therefore, a deeper investigation into the control mechanisms of emotion-related neural clusters and the subjective perception of external stimuli will significantly advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms of neural regulation.

11461730,Elucidation of the pluripotent potential of bovine embryonic lineages facilitates the establishment of formative stem cell lines,"The establishment of epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from cattle, which are important domestic animals that provide humans with milk and meat while also serving as bioreactors for producing valuable proteins, poses a challenge due to the unclear molecular signaling required for embryonic epiblast development and maintenance of PSC self-renewal. Here, we selected six key stages of bovine embryo development (E5, E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14) to track changes in pluripotency and the dependence on signaling pathways via modified single-cell transcription sequencing technology. The remarkable similarity of the gene expression patterns between cattle and pigs during embryonic lineage development contributed to the successful establishment of bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) using 3i/LAF (WNTi, GSK3βi, SRCi, LIF, Activin A, and FGF2) culture system. The generated bEpiSCs exhibited consistent expression patterns of formative epiblast pluripotency genes and maintained clonal morphology, normal karyotypes, and proliferative capacity for more than 112 passages. Moreover, these cells exhibited high-efficiency teratoma formation as well as the ability to differentiate into various cell lineages. The potential of bEpiSCs for myogenic differentiation, primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs) induction, and as donor cells for cell nuclear transfer was also assessed, indicating their promise in advancing cell-cultured meat production, gene editing, and animal breeding. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018-024-05457-z.","Embryonic epiblasts can differentiate into entire fetuses and serve as a crucial source of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines [ Stable domestic animal PSCs not only contribute to our understanding of embryonic development and pluripotency in livestock but also serve as optimal cell sources for animal breeding and cultured meat production [ Single-cell RNA sequencing enables precise mapping of embryonic development, facilitating the tracing of early embryonic lineages and transitions from embryonic cells to stem cells [ Here, we used single-cell transcriptome sequencing to demonstrate the similarities between cattle and pigs in early embryonic development and changes in pluripotency and successfully established stable formative epiblast stem cell lines from bovines using an optimized 3i/LAF culture system. This study provides valuable high-quality seed cells and novel avenues for investigating pluripotency in stem cells from livestock species while advancing research on stem cell-related breeding and cultured meat production. To elucidate the molecular basis of early bovine embryonic development and changes in pluripotency, combined with our insights into embryonic development in domestic animals, we optimized single-cell collection from bovine embryos at key time points (E5, E6, E7, E10, E12 and E14) (Fig.  Single-cell transcriptome sequencing deciphers lineage differentiation of bovine embryos.  In summary, single-cell transcriptome sequencing of bovine embryos comprehensively delineated embryonic lineages and accurately depicted the differentiation trajectory of each germ layer lineage. To investigate the dynamics of epiblast pluripotency and elucidate its characteristics across different developmental stages, we selected six stages of epiblast development for subsequent analysis: E5 pre-ICMs, E6 ICMs, E7 ICMs, E10 EPIs, E12 EPIs, and E14 ECTOs. After dimensionality reduction by the UMAP algorithm, we observed a distinct clustering pattern among these six stage-specific cell types, which specifically formed two clusters: E5–E7, and E10, E12, and E14 (Fig.  Tracing the dynamics of pluripotency of bovine embryonic lineages.  To gain further insights into the existence of the naïve, formative, and primed pluripotency stages during epiblast development in bovine embryos and to elucidate the underlying core regulatory signaling pathways involved, we performed pairwise comparisons to classify the 2267 differentially expressed genes from the aforementioned six-stage cells into 16 clusters (Table S4). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of representative genes associated with naïve pluripotency, such as  JAK/STAT3 pathway is sufficient for the establishment of naïve pluripotency [ Based on the analysis mentioned above, we believe that the E5-E7 pre-ICMs/ICMs are in a naïve pluripotent state, the E10-E12 EPIs are in a formative state, and the E14 ECTOs are in a primed state. These results characterize the molecular underpinnings of pluripotency in bovine epiblast development, and suggesting that the maintenance of bovine formative epiblast pluripotency relies on the activation of the FGF/ERK and TGFβ/SMADs signaling pathways, while the supplement with LIF and suppression of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways aligns with our observations in pig early embryos [ We next investigated the similarities and discrepancies in changes in pluripotency during bovine and porcine embryonic lineages development. To mitigate potential bias in stage mismatches between species, we initially conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and Spearman’s correlation analysis. PCA of bovine and porcine embryonic lineages revealed tight clustering of samples according to developmental stage and time (Fig.  Comparative analyses of developmental and pluripotency changes of embryonic lineages in cattle and pigs.  We posit that the establishment of stable epiblast stem cells, it is necessary to effectively maintain the self-renewal of bovine epiblasts while simultaneously inhibiting their spontaneous differentiation. As previously described, bovine EPIs exhibit responsiveness to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling, while the maintenance of self-renewal necessitates suppression of WNT signaling and activation of TGFβ/SMADs and FGF/ERK pathways. The regulatory mechanisms governing pluripotency in bovine and pig embryo lineages demonstrate remarkable similarity. Therefore, our objective was to establish bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) using a modified 3i/LAF culture system, which includes the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021, SRC inhibitor WH-4–023, WNT inhibitor IWR-1-endo, as well as LIF, Activin A, and FGF2. This culture system has been successfully utilized for the establishment of porcine pgEpiSCs [ Generation and characteristics of bEpiSCs.  Given that the E10 EPI represents a critical stage of formative pluripotency, we specifically chose E10 bEpiSCs for subsequent pluripotency assays and observed positive alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining in the colonies (Fig.  To investigate the impact of different cytokines and small molecule inhibitors incorporated into the 3i/LAF culture system on the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of bEpiSCs, we performed individual factor reduction to assess the functions of these molecules. Using 3i/LAF-cultured bEpiSCs as a control group, we replaced the factor-deleted medium after 12 h of passaging bEpiSCs. After 48 h of culture in factor-depleted medium and observation of cell morphology and AP staining, substantial flattening, loss of clear boundaries, and evident differentiation were observed in the bEpiSCs clones from the IWR-1-endo (IWR)-depleted group. In contrast, the bEpiSCs clones from the FGF2-depleted group exhibited significantly slower proliferation rates with smaller clone volumes and more severe cellular apoptosis (Fig.  3i/LAF are essential for the long-term subcultured of bEpiSCs.  To investigate the functions of three small molecule inhibitors related to the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in bEpiSC pluripotency and self-renewal, we collected third-generation bEpiSCs cultured with CHIR99021 (CHIR)/IWR/WH-4-023 (WH) depleted separately for differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. The analysis revealed that the removal of any WNT-related small molecule resulted in aberrant expression of the core pluripotency genes  The combination of CHIR and IWR was shown to maintain mouse EpiSC and human ESC self-renewal [ We further examined the effects of FGF2, Activin A, and LIF on the pluripotency of bEpiSCs and found that depletion of FGF2 resulted in dysregulation of the core pluripotency regulatory network and multilineage differentiation of bEpiSCs (Fig.  The single-cell transcriptomic features of bovine embryos serve as an unequivocal benchmark for assessing the pluripotency status of bovine embryo-derived stem cells. To further assess the gene expression characteristics and pluripotency status of bEpiSCs, we initially compared the single-cell transcriptomic data of bEpiSCs obtained from bovine embryos at different stages with those of bovine embryonic lineages (Table S1). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the developmental and pluripotency characteristics of bEpiSCs were strongly related to those of the E10-E12 epiblasts (Fig.  Transcriptomic profiling of bEpiSCs.  Next, we conducted a comparative analysis of bulk RNA transcriptomes between bEpiSCs established in this study and bovine PSCs reported previously, including primed bESCs [ To investigate the similarities and differences between bEpiSCs and pig pgEpiSCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression of these two cell types using bulk RNAseq data. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed no significant differences in pluripotency maintenance (e.g.,  In summary, we successfully established bovine formative EpiSCs, which exhibit distinct gene expression characteristics from other published bovine PSCs. We propose that bEpiSCs show good potential for myogenic differentiation, primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) generation and as donor cells for genome-edited animal cloning (Fig.  Potential applications of bEpiSCs.  In this study, utilizing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns during critical developmental stages in early bovine embryos. Our findings revealed the occurrence of a transition from naïve to formative and primed pluripotency states during the early embryonic epiblast development of bovine embryos. Specifically, we observed downregulation of LIF/STAT3 signaling-related genes during the transition from naïve to formative EPIs, while WNT/β-catenin signaling-related genes were upregulated during the transition from formative to primed EPIs. These results further underscore the evolutionary conservation of embryonic development and the regulation of pluripotency in artiodactyla (between cattle and pigs). Utilizing the optimized 3i/LAF culture system, we successfully established bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) based on the conserved early embryonic development observed in pigs and cattle. These cells demonstrated long-term stability, maintained a normal karyotype, exhibited characteristic features of formative epiblasts, expressed pluripotent marker genes, possessed the capacity for three germ layer developments both in vitro and in vivo, and displayed typical stem cell pluripotency. The bEpiSCs cultured under the 3i/LAF condition in this study exhibit characteristics of formative pluripotency. For the perspective of culture system, both FGF2 and WNT inhibitor were widely used in the culture of bPSCs except bEPSCs (for which FGF2 is not essential for bEPSCs self-renewal). The 3i/LAF culture system used in this study showed potent utility for the pluripotency and self-renewal of bovine formative PSCs. The addition of LIF was able to increase the pluripotency of epiblast stem cells in the presence of Activin A and FGF2 [ Notably, bovine bEpiSCs and porcine pgEpiSCs display remarkably similar clonal morphologies, pluripotency profiles, and transcriptomic profiles. This comprehensive investigation enhances our comprehension of both the commonalities and distinctions regarding embryonic pluripotency dynamics among livestock species. Moreover, bEpiSCs exhibit a robust potential for myogenic differentiation, thus providing a novel avenue for advancing cultured meat production. Additionally, bEpiSCs can be induced to differentiate into PGCLCs or utilized as donor cells for genome-edited cloned embryos, suggesting innovative prospects for subsequent developments in stem cell breeding and genome-editing techniques. In our previous work, we established a transcriptome map of single cells from porcine preimplantation embryos, which served as a valuable reference for the current project. Due to the similarities in embryonic development between cattle and pigs, coupled with animal welfare 3Rs requirements and logistical challenges associated with obtaining bovine embryos, we opted not to sample continuously but instead to select representative stages of embryonic development for analysis. Through comprehensive transcriptome analysis, we demonstrated that the gene expression patterns observed during these selected embryonic periods effectively captured the key characteristics of developmental progression at each stage without compromising subsequent investigations. Moreover, the critical determinant of embryo and stem cell chimerism lies in their developmental stage compatibility. Due to the derivation of bEpiSCs from pregastrulation embryo epiblasts and the lack of experimental techniques for verifying chimeric potential by injecting bEpiSCs into bovine gastrulation embryo epiblasts, as well as the absence of suitable in vitro culture conditions for gastrulation embryos and challenges associated with in vivo observation of gastrulation embryos, conducting experiments on embryo chimerism was deemed impractical.

 CD-1® (ICR) IGS and BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and were used for mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolation, and the bEpiSCs teratoma formation test. The MEFs were treated with mitomycin C (Selleckchem, S8146) to prepare feeder cells for bEpiSCs. Holstein cow embryos at E5, E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14 were used for bovine embryonic single-cell collection and single-cell transcriptome analyses. Embryonic day n (E(n)) embryos were obtained n days after mating. For bEpiSCs derivation, E7, E10, E12, and E14 embryos were used. The embryonic cells utilized in this study were exclusively derived from Holstein cow embryos. E5-E7 embryos were obtained by thawing and culturing frozen cow embryos until the desired developmental stage was reached. The zona pellucida was subjected to a 15–30 s Pronase (Sigma, 10,165,921,001) treatment, followed by cleaning and removal using a solution composed of DPBS + 0.1% BSA. Subsequently, the embryonic cells were mechanically separated and transferred into the lysate. E10, E12, and E14 embryos were obtained through in vivo transplantation and subsequent flushing, with single embryonic cells being isolated and collected via a combination of enzymatic treatment and mechanical manipulation. The components of the bovine epiblast stem cells culture system were the same as the 3i/LAF culture system previously reported [ Bovine ICMs, epiblasts, and ectoderms were isolated by mechanical isolation and treated with TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) for 3 min, then seeded onto feeder cells supplemented with 3i/LAF medium. Cultures were incubated at 5% O Single-cell RNA-seq library was prepared using a modified Smart-seq2 protocol, as previously described in studies [ The growth curve of bEpiSCs was plotted by seeding them at a density of 3 × 10 Bovine EpiSCs were digested with TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) and filtered through a 40 μm cell filter. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates with 100, 500, and 1000 cells, respectively. After 3 days of culture, the number of colonies formed was counted, and the single-cell colony formation rate was calculated and averaged. Before performing karyotype analyses, 1% KaryoMAX Colcemid Solution (Gibco, 15,212,012) was added to the bEpiSCs culture medium and incubated for 1 h. The bEpiSCs were then dissociated into single cells using TrypLE™ Express (Gibco, 12,605,010) and collected through centrifugation. Subsequently, the bEpiSCs were suspended in a hypotonic solution of 0.075 M KCl (Sigma, P5405) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following this step, the bEpiSCs were fixed with methanol and acetic acid in a ratio of 3:1; this process was repeated three times. The resulting suspension of bEpiSCs was dropped onto a pre-cooled slide, thoroughly dried at room temperature, and stained with a 10% Giemsa Stain Solution (Sangon, E6073140001) for a duration of 30 min. More than 45 metaphase cells were examined for each cell line. For details about AP staining procedures and precautions, refer to Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore, SCR004). The cells were washed with DPBS for immunofluorescence (IF) analyses, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with DPBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After another round of DPBS washing, the cells were blocked with 3% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C and subsequently washed three times using a wash buffer (DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times using the same wash buffer. Finally, DAPI staining was performed to visualize the nucleus, enabling direct observation and photography. Following digestion, the bEpiSCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 The prepared 1 × 10 The teratomas were subjected to two washes in DPBS and fixed with 4% PFA for a duration of 2 days at a temperature of 4 °C. Subsequently, the teratoma tissues underwent dehydration using an alcohol gradient (70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and finally, 100% for each hour) before being transferred into xylene and embedded in paraffin. The samples were sliced to a thickness of 5 μm, followed by deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration using decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Finally, the samples were stained with haematoxylin (Sigma–Aldrich, MHS16) and eosin (Sigma–Aldrich, HT110116), after which they were observed under a microscope (Leica, DM5500B). The total RNA was extracted from bEpiSCs using the RNA prep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (TIANGEN, DP430), followed by reverse transcription to cDNA using the 5 × All-In-One RT Master Mix (Abm, G490). Subsequently, PCR amplification was performed with the 2 × RealStar Green Power Mixture (GenStar, A311-05) on an Archimed Real Time System (ROCGENE). The data were analyzed utilizing the comparative CT (2 The protocol was performed as described for pig pgEpiSCs [ The induction of PGCLCs was conducted according to a modified protocol [ Total RNA was extracted separately from four bEpiSCs samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74,106). For constructing strand-specific RNA-seq libraries, we employed a rRNA depletion protocol (Globin-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit, Illumina, GZG1224) in conjunction with the NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, E7420S). All libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Q32851) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The GFP plasmid was stored in our laboratory. In brief, we generated a PB-CMV-EF1A-GFP-NLS plasmid by modifying the PB-CAG-MCS vector (provided by Prof. Sen Wu). Specifically, we substituted the chicken β-actin promoter with the  Bovine EpiSCs were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen, L3000008). Specifically, transfection was performed 16 h after normal cell passage in a 24-well plate. First, 25 μL Opti-MEM™ Medium was added to a centrifuge tube followed by the addition of 0.75 μL Lipofectamine™ 3000 Reagent and mixing well. Then, another centrifuge tube was taken and filled with 25 μL Opti-MEM™ Medium to which 0.5 μg DNA and 1μL P3000™ Reagent were added and mixed well. The DNA mixture was then combined with the Lipofectamine™ reagent at a ratio of 1:1 and allowed to incubate for10-15 min before being added to the cells for culture. Ovaries were obtained from cattle farms around Beijing, and oocytes in 3–8 mm follicles were extracted. The oocytes with three layers of cumulus cells were transferred to Maturation medium and matured at 38.5 °C and 5% CO For the STRT-seq dataset, Raw reads were split by 8 bp cell barcodes located on Read 2 allowing 2 mismatches. Additionally, the 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) located on Read 2 were switched to the identifier line of paired Read 1. Then Read 1 was processed to remove the template switch oligo (TSO) primer, low quality bases and polyA sequence [ To pre-process our bovine data, we loaded the entire raw count matrix dataset with metadata using Seurat (v-4.1.0.9) [ Sequencing reads for each gene were normalized and scaled in each cell after regression on the mitochondrial gene ratio and cell cycle scores by “ Based on the differentiation process during embryonic development, we grouped the bovine embryonic cells into three main lineages: embryonic lineages, covering pre-ICM at E5, ICM at E6 and E7, epiblasts at E10 and E12, and the ectoderms at E14; TE lineages, including pre-TE at E5, TE at E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14; and hypoblast lineages, including hypoblasts at E10, E12, and definitive endoderm at E14 (Fig.  To trace the dynamic changes of DEGs during embryonic development, we constructed the expression tendencies of DEGs in epiblast lineages. We first calculated the average expression levels for each gene at specific embryonic development time points in each respective lineage separately. The average expression levels were rescaled for embryonic lineage and analyzed by the k-means clustering method with parameters k = 10 and iter.max = 100, grouping the DEGs with similar tendencies during embryonic development into separate clusters. We downloaded orthologous genes list for three species (human, cattle and pig) via BioMart tool in the ensembl genome browser 105 ( R package Monocle3 (v-1.3.1) [ Expression levels of protein coding genes in all samples (our original bulk RNAseq dataset, and public datasets of biPSCs, bEPSCs, primed bESCs and pgEpiSCs) were quantified as transcripts per million (TPM) using kallisto (v-0.46.0). DEGs between different cell types were identified using the DEseq2 tool (v-1.30.1) [ For integrative analyses between bEpiSCs and bovine embryonic dataset, we used Seurat RPCA approach for anchors determination and datasets alignment. Top 2000 genes that were repeatedly variable across datasets were selected and anchors were identified using “ Functional enrichment analyses of selected genes were performed using Metascape ( Two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons test was used to analyses data of RT–qPCR in Figs.  Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

11460714,The expectations humans have of a pleasurable sensation asymmetrically shape neuronal responses and subjective experiences to hot sauce,"Expectations shape our perception, profoundly influencing how we interpret the world. Positive expectations about sensory stimuli can alleviate distress and reduce pain (e.g., placebo effect), while negative expectations may heighten anxiety and exacerbate pain (e.g., nocebo effect). To investigate the impact of the (an)hedonic aspect of expectations on subjective experiences, we measured neurobehavioral responses to the taste of hot sauce among participants with heterogeneous taste preferences. By identifying participants who “liked” versus those who strongly “disliked” spicy flavors and by providing contextual cues about the spiciness of the sauce to be tasted, we dissociated the effects of positive and negative expectations from sensory stimuli (i.e., visual and gustatory stimuli), which were the same across all participants. Our results indicate that positive expectations lead to modulations in the intensity of subjective experience. These modulations were accompanied by increased activity in brain regions previously linked to information integration and the placebo effect, including the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a predefined “pleasure signature.” In contrast, negative expectations decreased hedonic experience and increased neural activity in the previously validated “Neurological Pain Signature” network. These findings demonstrate that hedonic aspects of one’s expectations asymmetrically shape how the brain processes sensory input and associated behavioral reports of one’s subjective experiences of intensity, pleasure, and pain. Our results suggest a dissociable impact of hedonic information: positive expectations facilitate higher-level information integration and reward processing, while negative expectations prime lower-level nociceptive and affective processes. This study demonstrates the powerful role of hedonic expectations in shaping subjective reality and suggests potential avenues for consumer and therapeutic interventions targeting expectation-driven neural processes. Can positive and negative expectations of a sensory experience cause neuronal and perception differences? This study shows that sensory experiences and neuronal responses are shaped by whether a person likes spicy foods, suggesting that perception could be pharmacologically modulated.","Expectations, triggered by contextual signals in the environment, have a profound impact on how humans make sense of and react to the world [ Placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia are examples of how positive or negative expectations can relieve or enhance, respectively, human sensory experiences. Although both placebo and nocebo effects exert modulations in the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) [ Recent placebo and nocebo studies have demonstrated how positive and negative expectations can modulate sensory and emotional responses and highlight the complexity of expectation effects and the interplay between different neural circuits, including endogenous opioid and descending pain modulatory system (DPMS), as well as reward system [ A recent meta-analysis found only small placebo effects on a neurologic pain signature (NPS), a neural measure that sensitively and reliably tracks changes in nociceptive input and self-reports of pain that arise from it [ One’s expectations can be complex compositions that include both sensory and hedonic components. Sensory expectations adhere to stimulus qualities, such as sensory modality and intensity. By contrast, hedonic expectations are beliefs about the degree to which one will like/dislike a stimulus [ To address the question of how subjective experiences and neural responses are modulated by positive versus negative expectations (with expectations of sensory intensity controlled), we used a behavioral paradigm where participants continuously rated their subjective experience of stimulus intensity and variations in their associated hedonic experience while ingesting squirts of high- and low-intensity hot sauces or water. As an objective sensory input, we used hot sauces with variable, but quantifiable, amounts of capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in chili peppers that activates TRPV1 receptors on nociceptive neurons to produce a sensation of burning. This input allowed us to selectively activate a robust, receptor-specific sensory experience while controlling the intensity of an objective sensory cue [ Participants undergoing fMRI scanning tasted squirts of high- and low-intensity hot sauces, as well as squirts of water ( ( Presenting the neutral cue run before the intensity cue run was strategically chosen to establish a baseline response to the neutral cue before introducing the potential interference or contamination from intensity cues. This approach allowed us to probe the participants’ preferences before the potential inference of expectation manipulation. To increase the dynamics of changes in taste sensations during the task, we implemented a rinsing protocol. Before each of the 30 test squirts in both runs, participants received a rinse squirt of water ( We first pooled all participants ( Participants were recruited without advertising that the research was investigating “spicy” sauces. Once consented for a “sauce tasting” experiment, participants were told that the sauces may or may not be spicy; they were told that sensory experience may be pleasant or unpleasant according to their preference for spiciness, and then had the option to opt out if concerned. Despite this disclaimer, we were able to recruit comparable groups of participants who disliked ( Large individual differences in preference for the tasted sauces were demonstrated by the correlation of sensory ratings and hedonic ratings of each participant ( Although the interaction of group (liking group, disliking group) × stimulus (high, low, water) × expectation manipulation (neutral cue, intensity cue) for the heat rating was not significant,  Top 2 rows: heat intensity ratings; bottom 2 rows: like ratings. ( In terms of neural responses as measured by fMRI, only the liking group showed a significant effect for the contrast of  ( Interestingly, the response to squirts in the pleasure signature identified by a previous meta-analysis [ The interaction of group × stimulus × expectation manipulation for the like rating was not significant,  In the disliking group, the responses of the NPS [ ( We further explored whether the sensory or the affective aspect of the NPS was more likely modulated by the negative expectations in our task. We conducted ROI analyses within each of the key regions: S1 and thalamus (sensory); insula and amygdala (affective). We found a significant interaction between stimulus and expectation manipulation in the response in insula to squirts,  By controlling the intensity of sensory input and pairing these stimuli with visual cues, we found that the subjective experience of spiciness, as well as activations in AI and DLPFC, were modulated by expectations about the intensity of spiciness. Furthermore, by differentiating positive and negative expectations based on individual differences in hedonic preference for spicy taste, we demonstrate that, when the sensory expectations remained the same, positive expectations decreased the reported heat intensity and increased responses in AI, dorsal ACC, and DLPFC, as well as a predefined pleasure signature [ The effect of expectation has been observed in previous studies with different types of stimuli (e.g., beverages [ Importantly, our findings provide novel insight over previous observations into the influence of expectations on subjective states and preferences [ On the one hand, in people who preferred the spicy sauces, the subjective experience of spiciness intensity changed after simply observing a predictive visual cue that generated an expectation of capsaicin intensity. These expectations also induced increased activation in the AI, dorsal ACC, DLPFC, and areas in the pleasure signature for spicy sauces, but only in the group that liked the spicy sauces. These findings suggest a specific neural effect of positive expectations. Psychophysiological changes driven by positive expectations have been proposed to be a key underlying mechanism for placebo effects [ The increased activations in dorsal ACC and DLPFC induced by positive expectation echo the result from a recent meta-analysis identifying increased DLPFC and ACC responses associated with placebo effect [ On the other hand, in people who did not like the spicy sauces, visual cues that predicted the spiciness intensity did not change their subjective rating of capsaicin intensity, but these cues did significantly decrease their rating of the pleasantness of the sauce tasting compared to the same sauces tasting without intensity-predicting cues. This behavioral finding suggests a specific exacerbation of discomfort induced by negative expectations. However, we should hasten to note that while we observed distinct effects within the liking group and disliking group, respectively, these should not be interpreted as differences between the groups in the absence of significant interaction effects. Interestingly, negative expectations also induced stronger NPS responses, a validated measure that tracks levels of nociceptive pain [ Our findings indicate an asymmetric effect of hedonic expectation on sensory experience. Specifically, positive expectations (intensity cues) led to a significant reduction in the perceived spiciness of the low sauce in the liking group. This modulation was not observed in the disliking group or for high sauces in either group. The lack of significant interaction for high sauces may suggest a ceiling effect, where the high baseline intensity of spiciness might have limited the modulatory impact of expectations. This highlights the nuanced nature of sensory modulation by expectations, indicating that positive expectations may only significantly alter sensory perception when the stimulus intensity is not overwhelming. This asymmetric effect underscores the influence of hedonic predisposition on how sensory expectations are processed and perceived. In summary, the current study brings novel insights into the interplay of psychological and neural processes underlying the interaction between mind, body, and environment. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on the mechanisms of hedonic expectations by demonstrating neural and behavioral responses to positive and negative expectations. Earlier studies that induced positive or negative expectations showed modulated sensory and emotional responses [ The study has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave written consent to participate in the study, and all procedures were approved by Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board (approval number: VT IRB# 11–377). Fifty-three participants enrolled in the current study. Among them, 48 participants completed the 2 runs of tasks while undergoing fMRI scanning. The other 5 participants who only completed the first run of the task were excluded from data analyses. One participant was excluded because they did not respond behaviorally in the second run of the task, which leaves 47 subjects in total who completed the experiment (23 females, 30 ± 11.4 years old [mean ± SD]). Finally, only 1 participant did not show a significant correlation (positive or negative) between their heat intensity and sauce preference ratings and was excluded from further analyses. None of the participants have a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision. As shown in the left panel in  On the scan day, while the participant was lying in the scanner, high and low sauces, as well as water were delivered into the participant’s mouth, one squirt at a time, through 3 tubes (one for each type of squirt) bundled by a mouthpiece ( In the first run, a total of 60 squirts of sauce or water were delivered into the participant’s mouth, one squirt at a time. Among them, 30 test squirts, including 10 water squirts, 10 low squirts, and 10 high squirts, were delivered in a randomized order. In addition, 1 water squirt (a rinse squirt) was administered before each of the 30 test squirts to rinse and restore the participant’s mouth to a baseline level prior to the next test squirt ( The second run was nearly identical to run 1, except that the visual pepper cues were colored to indicate the heat intensity of the upcoming squirt ( A Spearman’s rank-order correlation comparing the participant’s ratings of “heat” and “like” during run 1 (there were no expectations about sauce spiciness intensity cued) was conducted to determine their preference for the spicy sauces (see  For each participant, the subjective rating of experienced heat on a 0 to 10 scale (integers from 0 to 10) was converted to z-scores which made each participant’s heat ratings have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (see  We first conducted a 3-way ANOVA test of group (between-subjects: Liking group, Disliking group) × stimulus (within-subjects: high, low, water) × expectation manipulation (within-subjects:  The subjective rating of flavor preference was also converted to z-scores within each subject. The z-scored heat ratings were interpolated with ZOH at 0.1 s intervals and then baseline-corrected by the average rating during the 5 s before the cue display. We also conducted a 3-way ANOVA test of group × stimulus × expectation manipulation on the average like rating during the saturated phase. After that, a repeated 2-way ANOVA test of stimulus × expectation manipulation was also done within each group on the average like rating during the saturated phase, followed by post hoc tests checking the effect of expectation on each type of squirt in each group. Imaging was conducted on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner. High-resolution T1-weighted scans (voxel size: 0.479 × 0.479 × 1.0 mm) were acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (Siemens). Functional images were acquired using echoplanar imaging (repetition time = 2,000 ms; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; 34 slices; voxel size: 3.44 × 3.44 × 4.0 mm). Images were analyzed using SPM12 ( General linear models (GLMs) were specified for each participant (first-level analysis). All visually and orally delivered stimuli and motor responses were modeled in the design matrix that was constructed by convolving each event onset with a canonical hemodynamic response function in SPM12. Residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the estimated 6 motion parameters for each participant as covariates. Low-frequency drifts were removed using a high-pass filter (128 s cutoff). Beta maps at squirt delivery were estimated respectively for each regressor at each run for each participant and then entered into group-level analyses. After dividing participants into the liking group and the disliking group, we tested how positive and negative expectations manipulate brain responses to spicy taste by conducting a whole-brain contrast: (sauce To examine the activations in pleasure/reward-related brain areas, we conducted a region of interest (ROI) analysis using a mask of pleasure signature identified by a previous meta-analysis [ To quantify the NPS response, the signature response was estimated for each test subject by taking the dot product of first-level activation images with the signature pattern, yielding a continuous scalar value. From there, to test whether NPS response was specifically sensitive to negative expectation, we ran a three-way ANOVA test of stimulus (sauce, water) × expectation manipulation ( Statistics on behavioral data were implemented using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The significance level was set at 0.05 for all analyses and Greenhouse–Geisser correction non-sphericity was used when appropriate.

11460426,Prevalence of syphilis and associated factors among pregnant women in Brazil: systematic review and meta-analysis,"This systematic review accompanied by a meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil and describe its associated factors. Following the establishment the search strategies and the registration of the review protocol in PROSPERO, we conducted a search for relevant articles in the Pubmed, LILACS, Science Direct, SciELO and Web of Science databases. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional studies published between 2005 and 2023, with no language restrictions. The combined prevalence of syphilis infection was estimated using the random effects model in the R Software with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and p < 0.01 as statistically significant. A total of 24 articles were recruited, which together investigated 221,884 women. The combined prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil was 1.79% (95% CI: 1.24-2.57%), and the main factors associated with its occurrence were black and brown skin color, low education and factors related to the partner. There was a high prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy in Brazil, mainly associated with socioeconomic factors.","Syphilis is considered a serious public health problem. Although there are preventive measures and accessible and effective treatment options, its prevalence is increasing worldwide, bringing several consequences for health, especially during the gestational period. Among the factors that contribute to the high prevalence of syphilis in Brazil, sociodemographic characteristics like black and brown skin color, low socioeconomic status, low education and, above all, failure in prenatal care can be observed. The mandatory registration of cases of Gestational Syphilis (GS) on SINAN has been established in Brazil since 2005. It is believed that knowledge about the prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy in the country and its possible associated factors, based on studies with primary data, can provide subsidies for the establishment of public health policies aimed at controlling and preventing the disease, in order to interrupting its chain of transmission and preventing negative outcomes and fetal deaths resulting from congenital syphilis. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis among pregnant women in Brazil and describe its associated factors. This systematic review and meta-analysis was developed based on the  The source was conducted in october 2023. Scientific articles published in journals and available in six electronic databases through advanced search. Were used:  In addition, references were also consulted to check whether studies not found in the databases. All retrieved studies were exported to the Rayyan application for deduplication and title, abstract and full-text screening by three independent researchers. The inclusion criteria adopted were: cross-sectional studies available in full, carried out in Brazil, reporting the prevalence of syphilis and/or possible associated factors and published in any language in the period between 2005 and 2023. The choice of this period is due to the beginning of the syphilis in pregnant women's notification in Brazil, representing a milestone in the epidemiology of syphilis. We excluded incomplete articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, case reports, literature reviews and studies that reported only the prevalence of syphilis acquired and congenital, excluding the gestational form. The titles and abstracts were read by three of the authors (IMO, BCTM and RCS), independently, to verify possible duplicate studies, as well as to meet the pre-established inclusion criteria. After an initial selection, eligible studies were read in full by the authors to compose the sample. Cases of disagreement between researchers were resolved by another researcher (RAS). Also independently, a predefined form was used by the two researchers to extract the following data from each study: name of the main author and year of publication, study location/region, sample size, test methods for detecting syphilis and its prevalence, as well as the methodological quality of the studies. To assess the quality of each selected study, the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data, developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) was used. The extracted data were inserted into a table in Microsoft Excel (version 2010) and exported to Software R (version 3.5.1) for statistical analysis. The forest plot was used to illustrate the results of the meta-analysis. To estimate the pooled prevalence of syphilis, the random effects model was used with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test and its degree was measured with I A total of 1,895 studies were retrieved from the databases: 1,049 from PubMed, 288 from Scopus, 217 from Science Direct, 146 from LILACS, 99 from Web of Science, 84 for Portal Capes and 12 from SciELO. After excluding duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 75 studies were selected for full-text reading. Of these, 24 cross-sectional studies including 221,884 pregnant women met the eligibility criteria. The study selection process is illustrated in  The studies were carried out between 2007 and 2020 and the population ranged from 185 to 54,813 pregnant women, as shown in  VDRL - venereal disease research laboratory; RT - rapid test, RPR=rapid plasma regain; FTA-Abs - fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, TPHA - treponema pallidum hema gglutination test, DBS - dried blood spot; ELISA - enzyme linked immunosorbent assay About the quality of studies, as shown in  Most studies (n=14) reported the factors associated with the occurrence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil, the most discussed among the studies were black and brown skin color, low level of education, and factors related to the partner like conflictual relationship, drug use and previous history of STIs by the partner ( Other factors mentioned were age, specially under 30 years old, previous history of STI or violence and early sexual intercourse. The publication bias was assessment through visual inspection of the funnel plot, which appears symmetrical, indicating low risk of bias. The Egger test was t = −0.40 (p = 0.69) ( Sensitivity analyzes were performed to assess the influence of study quality as well as population size on the meta-analysis. However, when studies with a score lower than 8 in the quality assessment or with a population of less than a thousand women were excluded, there was no reduction in heterogeneity (analyses available in the  This study presents the combined prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women in Brazil between 2005 and 2023. Although similar publications already exist, this review specifically addresses Brazil and updates a previous publication about this relevant topic. According to the results obtained, syphilis during pregnancy presents itself as a public health problem, especially affecting socially less favored classes. The estimated pooled prevalence of syphilis in the present meta-analysis was 1.79% (95% CI: 1.24-2.57%) among pregnant women in Brazil. This prevalence was similar to results found in a previous primary study conducted in the five regions of the country with 23,894 pregnant women, which showed a prevalence of 1.02%. Corroborating this hypothesis, when compared to studies carried out in the African continent, this study demonstrates a low prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy in Brazil. In Ethiopia, a cross-sectional study including 210 pregnant women reported a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI: 0.5-3.5%) The two most comprehensive cross-sectional studies included in this review found similar prevalences (0.89% and 1.10%) with the estimate obtained in our meta-analysis (1%). Regarding the factors associated with the occurrence of syphilis in pregnant women, socioeconomic factors stand out. The results of this systematic review indicate that black and brown color skin, low education, factors related to the partner like conflictual relationship, drug use and previous history of STIs by the partner and factors related to pregnancy and prenatal care in addition to unfavorable living conditions, significantly influence the rates of syphilis infection during the gestation. A study carried out in Fortaleza – Ceará (CE) reported maternal characteristics similar to those found in this research, corroborating the influence of socioeconomic conditions in the determination of gestational syphilis. As described in the literature, two phenomena corroborate for women with low education and low income to lead the prevalence rates of syphilis in pregnancy, namely, the limited understanding about the importance of measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), The age group most affected by syphilis during pregnancy in brazilian women was between 20 and 29 years old. Similar findings were described in places like Macaé - Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and Americana - São Paulo (SP), based on secondary data provided by the Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance. Late initiation of prenatal care is also a factor with a strong impact on the detection and treatment of syphilis. The Ministry of Health recommends that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis, at least, in the first prenatal consultation, at the beginning of the third trimester and during hospitalization for childbirth, since this diagnosis is basically serological. This study has limitations, such as the high heterogeneity between studies. Due to the great spatial and methodological variability of the studies, pooled estimates were also calculated for specific characteristics, like studies with population size > 1000 women and score > 8 in the JBI instrument (supplementary material). However, sensitivity analyzes were not able to explain the higher heterogeneity, but we carefully explored the available literature in search of factors that could explain such heterogeneous results. In addition, the selection of studies, data extraction and assessment of the quality of the included articles can be influenced by judgments on the part of the authors, and to mitigate this risk, such steps were performed by more than one researcher, independently. Future studies can be conducted for to investigate the particularities between regional subgroups and sociodemographic characteristics regarding the prevalence of syphilis in the pregnant population. There was a high prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy in Brasil, mainly associated with socioeconomic factors, like color skin and scolarship, factors related to the partner and low adherence to prenatal care.","['Syphilis', 'Pregnant women', 'Pregnancy complications', 'infectious', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Brazil']",2024-5-27,Revista Brasileira de Ginecologia e Obstetrícia,STI
11459845,"Cervical cancer screening service utilisation and related factors among women on antiretroviral therapy in public health facilities of Asella town, Ethiopia, cross-sectional study","Cervical cancer is the predominant form of cancer in Ethiopia, accounting for the majority of malignant cases. Women account for two-thirds of cancer-related deaths in the country. Cervical cancer screening (CCS) can help prevent disease development, but screening rates are unacceptably low. The greatest number of women were in the most vulnerable group, and the availability of wheal data on their use of CCSs was limited. This study aimed to evaluate the use of CCS and the factors that influence its use among HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities. This study used a cross-sectional study design. A total of 396 (97.5%) HIV-positive women participated in this study between March 10 and May 30, 2023. Participants enrolled in public health facilities in Asella town were selected through systematic random sampling, and data were collected through on-site interviews using a pretested, structured questionnaire. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science, Version 26. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determining factors. The findings from this study indicated that 30.3% of individuals used cervical cancer screening services. Those women who had knowledge about cervical cancer had a 2.54 times greater likelihood of receiving CCS than those who were not informed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = (2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42–4.56). Women with a history of sexually transmitted diseases were twice as likely to use CCS as those without such a history (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.13–3.73). Furthermore, women with a positive attitude towards CCS were found to be significant predictors of utilisation, showing a greater than threefold greater likelihood of using these services (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.78–5.81). The proportion of HIV-positive women who underwent cervical cancer screening (CCS) was significantly lower than the recommended guideline of 80%. To enhance the uptake of screening among women with HIV, healthcare professionals should focus on enhancing awareness about cervical cancer, improving attitudes towards CCS, and advancing knowledge about the disease. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-024-10003-0.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary etiological agent responsible for the development of cervical cancer (CC), a disease affecting reproductive organs [ Cervical cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer and the 2nd most common female cancer in women aged 15 to 44 years globally [ The primary causes of the high incidence of cervical cancer are early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, HIV infection, history of STIs, HPV infection, smoking, limited access to early detection resources, and inadequate HPV vaccination coverage [ In response to the growing incidence of cervical cancer, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging global collaborative efforts to eliminate the disease. Eradication entails decreasing the number of new cases to less than 4 per 100,000 women annually through regular screening [ In Ethiopia, however, there is limited utilization of HPV screening, and the barriers to this have not been fully examined, especially in our region. These insights are essential for enhancing healthcare professionals’ awareness and pinpointing the health facilities offering cervical cancer screening services. This study sought to evaluate the current use of HPV screening among HIV-positive women and determine the factors that may influence it. The study was conducted in Asella town, southeast Ethiopia. In the study area, 1 government referral hospital, 2 general hospitals, and 2 health centres provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) services. The study was carried out between April 10 and May 10, 2023. An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used. All HIV-positive women who were receiving ART were followed up in Asella town public health facilities. All HIV-positive women who attended ART follow-up clinics in Asella town public health facilities during the study period composed the study population. A total of 695 study participants were selected from public health facilities. All HIV-positive women aged 15 to 49 years were included in the study. HIV-positive women who were unable to be interviewed because of severe health problems such as mental problems, who were critically sick, or who had hearing defects at the time of data collection were excluded from the study. There are 3 public health institutions in Asella town. Currently, two of the institutions, Asella Referral Hospital and Asella Health Centre were the only public health facilities that provided services for ART and CCS. There were 3850 patients currently enrolled in an ART clinic at Asella Referral Hospital; 2399 (62.3%) of these patients were women, and 1763 (73.5%) of these patients were eligible for the study. Approximately 844 patients from the Asella Health Centre were enrolled in the ART-Clinic, of whom 551 (65.3%) were women and 426 (32%) were eligible for this study period. For the first objective, the sample size was determined using Epi info version 7.2.5. Accordingly, the sample size was calculated by considering the following assumptions: the proportion of CCS service utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive women attending adult ART clinics in public health facilities in Hawassa town, Ethiopia, 2019, was 40.1% [ The sample size was proportionally allocated to these health institutions based on the average of three months of ART client flow prior to the data collection. The total population for these health institutions (their average monthly ART flows were estimated to be 695) (630 for Asella Hospital and 65 for Asella Health Centre). Then, the calculated sample size was proportionally allocated to the size of the clients of the two health institutions by the rule of probability proportional to size sampling. Finally, the study participants were selected from each health institution using a systematic random sampling technique (i.e., Kth = N/sample size = > 695/406 ≈ 2, which means Kth = 2); thus, every 2nd mother was recruited as a study unit in each health facility until the total sample size for this study was obtained.

A  Ten items were used to measure knowledge of cervical cancer screening. First, we assign a response code of 1 for the right response and a code of 0 for the incorrect response. After that, we added all of the answers to the knowledge questions to determine a final score of 10. The mean was computed using the results of 10 knowledge assessment questions. The expected scores ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum. After calculating the overall score for each participant, we summed all the overall scores and divided the result by the total number of participants. Then, we classified poor knowledge as those whose mean knowledge score was below the obtained mean and good knowledge as those whose score was equal to or above the mean [ Eight questions were used to gauge attitudes toward cervical cancer screening using a Likert scale. Participants’ responses were used to determine the following scoring system: strongly agree, 5; agree, 4; neither agree nor disagree, 3; disagree, 2; and strongly disagree, 1. All of the recoded attitude responses were combined by adding each response to obtain an overall score of 8. This is the mean of the Likert scale dichotomous to disagree and agree, which is calculated by merging strongly agree and agree recorded as “1” and all other values (strongly disagree, disagree, and neutral) by decoding “0.” The expected scores ranged from 0 to 8, with 8 being the maximum. After determining the mean score, respondents were classified as having either a favourable or unfavourable attitude depending on whether they scored above or below the mean [ The questionnaires were prepared in the English language and translated to Afaan Oromo by a language expert to check consistency. The questionnaires were adapted after reviewing different relevant literature [ The questionnaire was translated from English to Afaan Oromo and back to English by a language expert to assure its consistency. The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the total sample size in the Huruta Health Centre, which is located 40 km away from the study area, and the data collection tool was modified in terms of sequence, grammar and how to conduct interviews. One day of training was given to the data collectors and supervisors regarding the aim of the study, the data collection tool and the procedures of the questionnaires. Supervision was provided by the Principal Investigator and Supervisor. All completed data collection forms were examined for completeness and consistency during the data collection period. Supervisors and principal investigators reviewed each questionnaire daily and checked for completeness, and further editions were made.

After normality was verified, the respondents’ mean age was 32.8 years, and the standard deviation (SD) was 8.68, with a range of 20 to 49 years. In terms of marital status, 261 respondents (65.9%) were married. Additionally, approximately 278 (70.2%) of the participants were urban dwellers. Of the study participants, 234 (64.1%) belonged to the Oromo ethnic group. Regarding their religion, 183 (46.2%) respondents were Orthodox, and 153 (38.36%) were Muslim. (Table  
 Sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive women in Asella town public health facilities in Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 The proportion of women with HIV who underwent CCS in Asella town was 120 (30.3%). The primary reason for not screening for CC among women was their perception of their health (157, 56.9%), followed by lack of knowledge (70, 25.4%). Approximately 340 (85.9%) women had a history of pregnancy. One hundred seventy-eight (52.4%) women were multipara, followed by 89 (26.2%) who were primiparous.

Age, educational status, occupational status, parity, history of sexually transmitted infections, information provided by health professionals, knowledge status, and attitudes were associated with the use of cervical cancer screening among women who were HIV positive, with  Mothers with a secondary education or higher were 2.39 times more likely to use cervical cancer screening than mothers without a formal education (AOR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.22–4.67). Mothers with a history of STIs were twice as likely to have undergone cervical cancer screening as mothers who had never had a history of STIs (AOR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.13–3.73). If participants had a positive attitude toward the procedure, they were three times more likely to use cervical cancer screening than if they had a negative attitude (AOR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.78–5.81).

 Factors associated with cervical cancer screening utilization among HIV-positive mothers in Asella town public health facilities, Southeast Ethiopia, 2023 Note:  The objective of this study was to evaluate the utilization of cervical cancer screening services among women with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy at public health facilities in Asella town. Based on recent survey data, it was found that 30.3% of women living with HIV received cervical cancer screenings. This rate is considerably higher than the 7.8% in the Tigray Region [ Our research findings reveal that cervical cancer screening rates are suboptimal in countries with comparable ecological and economic circumstances. In South Africa, the screening rate for women stands at 65% [ In this study, mothers who were HIV positive and had completed at least secondary school were 2.39 times more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than mothers who had not received any formal education. Similar studies conducted in Ethiopia, specifically in the nation [ Women with HIV and a history of STIs were more likely to undergo cervical cancer screening than were those without a history of STIs. Studies conducted at Adama Hospital and Medical College yielded similar findings [ In HIV-positive women, having a thorough understanding of cervical cancer increased the likelihood of using screening services by 2.56 times compared to those with limited knowledge. Previous studies in Tanzania [ The utilization of cervical cancer screening among HIV-positive women was found to be lower than recommended. Factors such as educational status, history of sexually transmitted diseases, knowledge of cervical cancer, and attitudes towards screening were significant predictors of whether women received screenings. Asella referral hospitals and Asella health centre should focus on increasing awareness and educating HIV-positive women on the importance of screening. Healthcare providers’ collaboration with both government and nongovernmental stakeholders plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of accessibility and attendance at screening services. Despite all these rates falling below the recommended levels of CCS utilisation in different public health services, implication to the improvements of ultimately in a short period of time are uncertain in our facility, in our country and even in Sub-Saharan Region. The Ministry of Health and other governmental and nongovernmental organizations should also launch educational campaigns using various mass media platforms to address negative attitudes towards screening and promote uptake among HIV-positive women. We were able to determine the most important diseases and population conditions from extensive reviews to the most recent WHO recommendations, which urge frequent cervical cancer assessments of high-risk groups every two years as important, especially for women who are HIV positive. However, our study used a cross-sectional study design that did not show a cause-and-effect relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

11458712,"Flood risk assessment under the shared socioeconomic pathways: a case of electricity bulk supply points in Greater Accra, Ghana","This study evaluates flood susceptibility and risk on Bulk Supply Points in the Greater Accra region (GAR) using a Frequency Ratio model based on 15 flood conditioning factors. The model explores the influence of natural, meteorological and anthropogenic factors on flooding occurrences under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and assesses flood risks at Bulk Supply Points (BSPs). Flood susceptibility mapping was conducted for both current and future periods under various SSP scenarios. Results reveal that elevation, slope, soil type, distance from urban areas, and SPI are the most influential factors contributing to flooding susceptibility in the region. The current flood map, about 37% of the total area of GAR categorized under the moderate flood-susceptible zone category followed by about 30% categorized under the low flood-vulnerable zone. However, about 16% was categorized under the very high flood-vulnerable zone. The study projects increasing flood susceptibility under the SSP scenarios with intensification under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. For instance, the areas categorized as high and very high flood susceptibility zones are projected to expand to approximately 32% and 26% each by 2055 under SSP3. The study also assesses flood risks at Bulk Supply Points (BSPs), highlighting the escalating susceptibility of power assets to flooding under different scenarios. For instance, in the very high scenario, flooding is estimated to reach 640 h in 2045 and exceed 800 h in 2055—more than double the 2020 baseline. The analysis shows the bulk supply points face increasing flood susceptibility, with risks escalating most sharply under the severe climate change SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios. Over 75% of BSPs are expected to fall in the low- to medium-risk categories across SSPs while more than 50% of BSPs are within medium- to high-risk categories in all scenarios except SSP1, reflecting the impact of climate change. SSP3 and SSP5 stand out with over 60% of BSPs facing high or very high flooding risks by 2055. It indicates moderate resilience with proper adaptation but highlights potential disruptions in critical infrastructure, such as BSPs, during persistent flooding. The findings of the study are expected to inform Ghana’s contributions towards addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 11 and 13 in Ghana.","Over the years, various forms of natural and anthropogenically-induced disasters, such as earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and floods, amongst others, have occurred [ Sarkar and Mondal [ The UN regional Coordinator in Dakar revealed that the July 2007 flood event in West Africa was the most tragic flood event in the last 30 years. As a result of the flood event, more than 210,000 and 785,000 people were killed and displaced, respectively. Again, about 600,000 inhabitants were affected after torrential rains in 16 Wwest African countries where Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger and Senegal were the most affected. Aside from this, Nigeria in 2012 recorded one of the most catastrophic flood events ever observed, which resulted in the displacement and death of 2.3 million and 363 people, respectively [ The existence of perennial urban flooding in Ghana dates back to 1930 [ Flooding has a significant impact on power systems. It can lead to long outage times and the destruction of power system equipment such as substations, transmission lines, and power plants [ Flooding is of particular concern for the bulk supply points (BSPs) that deliver electricity from generating plants to end users in the Greater Accra region. These facilities, operated by the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo), contain vital transformers, switching gear and control equipment. Flood damage to BSPs can disrupt the entire downstream supply chain, affecting hospitals, businesses, homes, and other critical services. In 2015, major flooding of a GRIDCo substation in Achimota left many parts of Accra without power for several days [ Therefore, mapping flood susceptibility to design management schemes can combat the destruction of BSPsin the future and be used to direct governments and policymakers to establish appropriate flood management strategies. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques now have the capacity to support a new understanding of the assessment of susceptibility with better justification [ Other studies have employed various robust methodologies to map flood susceptibility. For instance, previous studies [ Several studies have generally mapped flood susceptibility in the Greater Accra region. However, most of these studies were limited to only the Accra metropolitan area. For example, Dekongmen et al. [ Greater Accra spans approximately 3,245 km Study area map In the Greater Accra region, flooding is a recurring concern, particularly in low-lying areas and zones with poor drainage systems. Heavy rainfall during the peak seasons, compounded by the region's topography and land use, often leads to inundation and waterlogging. The lack of adequate infrastructure and urban planning exacerbates this issue, making some areas prone to flash floods and subsequent damage to property and livelihoods. Additionally, the encroachment on waterways and wetlands further contributes to the region's susceptibility to flooding incidents. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive flood mitigation strategies, improved drainage systems, and sustainable urban development practices to minimize the impact of flooding in Greater Accra. The detailed specifications of the datasets used in the study are presented in Table  Sources and type of data used Flood conditioning factors used for the study Elevation is a key factor affecting flooding, with lower elevations generally experiencing a higher risk of flooding [ Slope is a crucial factor in hydrology, with a direct relationship to surface runoff and a significant impact on flooding [ Curvature offers important insights into the terrain's geomorphological characteristics [ TWI and SPI are critical hydrological factors commonly used in flood studies. TWI (Topographic Wetness Index) maps the spatial distribution of moisture, influencing surface runoff patterns [ In this study, geology is regarded as a key conditioning factor due to its direct impact on the ground's water absorption capacity [ In susceptibility mapping, understanding the spatial distribution of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is crucial for identifying which land use types and activities are most affected by frequent flooding. Different LULC categories, such as croplands, bare lands, and built-up areas, particularly in low-lying regions, can significantly influence flood occurrence and severity. For instance, areas with extensive croplands may experience increased runoff due to soil disruption, while bare lands offer minimal absorption and can lead to heightened surface runoff. Built-up areas, especially in flood-prone zones, often have impervious surfaces that exacerbate flooding by preventing natural water absorption [ Proximity to natural drainage is a critical conditioning factor due to its substantial impact on flooding. Areas located near natural drainage systems, such as streams and rivers, are more prone to flooding because these water bodies can quickly convey excess water during heavy rainfall. The distance from streams is an important aspect to consider; regions closer to streams are at a higher risk of flooding compared to those further away. This is because the closer proximity allows for less time for water to dissipate, leading to quicker accumulation and higher flood risks in these areas. Drainage density, which measures the extent of stream networks within the study area, also plays a crucial role in flood events. A higher drainage density, with numerous and densely packed streams, can exacerbate flooding by increasing the volume and speed of surface runoff. Areas with a high drainage density often experience more frequent and severe floods due to the efficient and rapid channeling of water from rainfall into streams and rivers. Figure  The distance from urban areas and roads is a vital factor in assessing flood susceptibility in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Urbanization significantly alters the region's hydrological dynamics, influencing its susceptibility to flooding. Analyzing how proximity to urban centers and transportation networks affects flood risk is essential for effective flood risk management and mitigation. Urbanization tends to increase flood risks through multiple mechanisms. The expansion of built-up areas does not only result in more impervious surfaces, but also lead to issues such as improper solid waste disposal into drainage systems, which can clog and impair their functionality, construction activities, especially in or near waterways, can further disrupt natural water flow and exacerbate flooding as well as informal activities in unplanned urban areas—such as unauthorized encroachments, and illegal dumping can severely affect drainage systems and water flow patterns. These activities can redirect or concentrate runoff towards areas not adequately prepared for high volumes of water, increasing the likelihood of severe flooding. Figure  In evaluating flood susceptibility, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is crucial for assessing land cover and land use changes. NDVI values range from − 1 to 1, with higher values reflecting healthier and denser vegetation (Fig.  The aspect, or the direction a slope faces, is a key factor in flood susceptibility within the region of Ghana (Fig.  For flood susceptibility mapping, it is imperative to consider historical flood occurrence data that is scientifically justified to forecast future floods [ Greater Accra Flood inventory map The evaluation of flood susceptibility is relevant to discover the conditioning factors of floods. The association between the occurrence of flooding and the related conditioning factors can be detected based on historical flooding events and their causative factors. The study utilizes the FR model in generating the flood susceptibility maps for Greater Accra under the SSP scenarios. The FR model is a bivariate statistical analysis technique that critically analyzes the contribution of each class of each flood conditioning factor on future flooding [ An FR value greater than 1 indicates significant parameters that strongly contribute to flooding. Conversely, an FR value less than 1 signifies an inverse relationship between flood occurrence and the conditioning factors [ After the estimation of the FR for every class, all values for each conditioning factor are summed for generating the final flood susceptibility map. The formula for the final flood susceptibility index (FSI) (see Eq.  The FR approach has been successfully applied for flood susceptibility mapping globally [ However, prediction rate is calculated as The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [ Figure  Methodological flowchart for flood susceptibility mapping Historical precipitation data from 1991 to 2020 was obtained from the World Climate Guide to determine average monthly rainfall days in Accra [ Future rainfall intensification under each SSP scenario was quantified using the prediction rates of influential flood conditioning factors (precipitation, land cover, and distance from urban areas) from the frequency ratio flood model results. The relative increase in these factors compared to 2020 baseline levels was used to scale the typical 8-h flooding duration each month and estimate future flood duration hours through to 2055. The locations of 45 electricity bulk supply points (BSPs) in Greater Accra were mapped in GIS software using data obtained from GRIDCo and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), as presented in Appendix 3. The capacity and average annual availability of each BSP facility were compiled based on information from the electricity distribution companies. Availability factors of 0.85 accounting for maintenance downtime were applied to estimate each BSP's annual electricity supply potential in MWh based on its capacity in MW. We define power denial in this context to mean power not available to consumers due to the shutdown of a flooded BSP. Flood susceptibility maps were used to identify BSP susceptibility to flood which is crucial for a comprehensive risk assessment. While flood depth and duration are primary factors in determining potential inundation, the use of flood susceptibility maps provided additional critical insights by incorporating multiple flood conditioning factors such as elevation, land cover, and drainage density. This multidimensional approach enhanced the predictive accuracy of flood risks, which informs strategic planning for infrastructure resilience under different climate scenarios. The flood duration estimated each month per SSP scenario were assumed to represent BSP outage times during an extreme flooding event to quantify power denial in Eq. ( Table  Features and FR results of flood factors For distance from stream, areas with distance between 0.0024 and 0.0053 m to stream recorded an FR value of 1.34. This signifies that as the distance decreases from a stream, the FR value increases leading to a high probability of flooding in these areas. Likewise, FR values tend to increase as distance from urban areas decreases. For instance, areas with distance between 1–72.56 and 72.56–141.87 m from urban recorded 1.08 and 1.33 FR values, respectively, showing a high probability of flooding in these areas (Table  From Table  Concerning drainage density, areas with low drainage density have higher chances of flooding. For instance, areas with lower drainage density (< 27) in Greater Accra observed about 38% of historical flooding as FR values for subclasses between 0.001–13.3 and 13.3–26.99 were all above one (see Table  The TWI and elevation are also important flood conditioning factors. Flood probability tends to increase where TWI increases. For instance, all the subclasses (except the first subclass) had FR values greater than one (see Table  For preparing the flood-vulnerable maps, layers were created for all—15 flood conditioning factors and prediction rates estimated respectively. The prediction rate, which curbs issues of drawback and considers the mutual interrelationship among independent factors was estimated. The prediction rate reveals the sensitivity of individual flood conditioning factors with the training data. All the flood conditioning factors were combined for the baseline and future periods to generate flood susceptibility maps for the baseline period and under the SSP scenarios. For preparing the flood-vulnerable map for the baseline period, the results were categorized into 5 subclasses ranging from very low to very high. Figure  Flood susceptibility map of Greater Accra region for the year 2020 Prediction rate of flood conditioning factors used in the FR model (left) and percentage of flood susceptibility zones (right) ROC curve of the FR model Figure  Flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios in 2055 relative to the baseline Percentage of flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios Percentage change in flood susceptibility zones under the SSP scenarios relative to the baseline scenario Flood susceptibility projections under the SSP2 scenario reveals similar trends as in SSP1, especially from 2020 to 2035 (see Fig.  The flood susceptibility projections in the SSP3 scenario resembled those of the SSP2 scenario, showcasing a prevalence of moderate flood susceptibility from 2040 to 2045. Nevertheless, under the SSP3, there's an anticipated rise in the extent of high and very high flood susceptibility zones compared to the SSP2. Specifically, the areas categorized as high and very high flood susceptibility zones are projected to expand to approximately 31.4% and 26% respectively by 2050, compared to the respective percentages of 29.4% and 24.3% under SSP2, and are expected to maintain similar increments by 2055 (Fig.  Elevation, slope, proximity to urban areas, soil type/geology, and SPI are anticipated to serve as the primary influential factors driving flooding occurrences within the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios, as outlined in Appendix 1. However, the upward movement of distance from urban in the prediction rate, together with other drivers, shifted the dominant flood susceptibility index from moderate to high (see Appendix 1). This is evident in the 2055 of SSP2 and SSP3 where distance from urban became the second most significant flood conditioning factor (see Appendix 1). For SSP5, flood susceptibility projections reveal a similar trend as SSP1 across all the years under study (see Fig.  Figure  Flooding duration for different intensity scenarios The baseline flood susceptibility map in Fig.  2020 flood susceptibility map of the BSPs BSP flood susceptibilities and power denied across SSP scenarios The analysis shows the bulk supply points face increasing flood susceptibility, with risks escalating most sharply under the severe climate change SSP3 and SSP5 scenarios. In the 2025–2035 period, over 75% of BSPs fall in the low- to medium-risk categories across SSPs. However, by 2055, more than 50% of BSPs are within medium- to high-risk categories in all scenarios except SSP1, reflecting the impact of climate change. SSP3 and SSP5 stand out with over 60% of BSPs facing high or very high flooding risks by 2055. Coastal and low-lying BSPs like Tema Siemens, Dawhenya, and Awoshie are most vulnerable, with thousands of megawatt-hours denied each year. Persistent failures at these facilities would cripple industrial zones and commercial areas. The results highlight the urgent need for flood resilience adaptation, as power assets currently lack protection. Without major infrastructure improvements, Accra faces severe electricity service disruptions from BSP failures due to flooding, jeopardizing critical facilities and economic functions. Early action under SSP1 to limit emissions and upgrade at-risk BSPs could avoid the worst impacts. However, delayed action under SSP3 and SSP5 could leave Accra's power system highly susceptible to devastating floods. Proactive resilience investments will be essential to ensure BSP operability and energy security for Greater Accra's growing population. The flood risk analysis shows power denied due to outages escalating over time, but with distinct trends across scenarios as shown in Fig.  Electricity denied forecast (left) and percentage of electricity denied from total BSP supply (right) The results of the study show high positive correlation between the flood conditioning factors and the occurrence of flooding in the Greater Accra region as revealed by the FR values. Elevation, distance from urban, slope, soil, SPI and precipitation were the first five most sensitive parameters that is expected to influence flooding in the Greater Accra region, with SPI and precipitation interchanging positions under the SSP scenarios. Several studies have attributed flooding in Greater Accra to non-meteorological factors [ Again, distance from urban areas is the second-most sensitive flood conditioning factor in the Greater Accra region, especially in the future under the SSP scenarios. The SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios are expected to be the worst-case scenarios where high flood susceptibility zones are expected to generally dominate. This may be attributed to the population projections under the SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios. For instance, population is expected to hit 9 and 12.6 billion by the end of the twenty-first century [ The results show Accra's power system should increase adaptation measures to manage future supply impacts due to flooding as persistent flooding of these facilities would paralyze southern Accra's power supply chain. Key industrial and commercial areas could face prolonged blackouts during flood events, and hospitals, water services, and other critical infrastructure would be jeopardized. To enhance resilience, flood defenses should be prioritized at the most vulnerable BSPs, like Achimota, Weija, Ridge, Dawhenya, Tema, Awoshie, Afienya, Spintex, Adabraka, Avenor, Tseaddo, Kokomlemle, and and Graphic Road substations. Elevating or relocating flood-prone components like transformers could enable them to function during lower-level flooding events [ This study analyzed current and future flood risks and their impacts on electricity bulk supply points in Greater Accra, Ghana under different climate change (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios. The study used 16 flood conditioning factors in simulating current and future flood conditions under the SSP scenarios using the Frequency Ratio (FR) model. The performance of the model was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, displaying high accuracy (an Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.83) for flood susceptibility mapping in Greater Accra. Analysis reveals elevation, distance from urban areas, slope, soil type, SPI, and precipitation as the primary influential parameters increasing flood susceptibility in the region. Notably, elevation emerges as a critical factor, especially for areas near the coast between 21 and 47.25 m above sea level. Moreover, the distance from urban areas, particularly under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios, emerges as another significant factor affecting flooding due to population growth and subsequent urbanization. Moreover, the study identified vulnerable electricity infrastructure and projected potential impacts on power supply for the region under the SSP scenarios. The results illustrate the urgent need to adapt Accra's power system infrastructure to increasing flood hazards driven by climate change. Electricity disruption due to flooding is projected to grow, leaving coastal and low-lying bulk supply points at high risk. Persistent flooding of these facilities would cripple Accra's electricity supply chain, jeopardizing key services and economic functions. To enhance resilience, the study recommends prioritizing upgrades like flood barriers, elevated equipment, and infrastructure hardening at the highest-risk bulk supply points. Restricting new development in floodplains is also critical to limit exposure. Collaborative adaptation efforts between utilities, government agencies, and communities will be essential to develop tailored resilience strategies. Model coupling with long-term energy system optimization models will also reveal optimal energy planning pathways to mitigate flooding impacts in the future, as part of further studies.","['Flood modeling', 'SSPs', 'Buly supply points', 'Flood risk', 'Sustainable development', 'Frequency ratio', 'Flood susceptibility']",2024-10-7,Discover Water,STI
11470826,Toxic Shock Syndrome: Rare but Deadly,"Invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease, although rare, has a high mortality and morbidity rate, making early recognition and treatment crucial. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and necrotizing fasciitis are the most feared complications and require comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment. In addition to appropriate support and resuscitation, patient management should include empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy covering gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant  The authors describe the clinical case of a 31-year-old man with no medical history or risk factors, who developed invasive disease from ","A previously healthy 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a history of less than 48 hours of fever and pain, swelling, and erythema in the mid-third of the right leg. The patient denied any trauma, insect bites, recreational drug use, recent surgery, corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, or any other complaints. Initially, he was assessed by the Internal Medicine team, which described a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 24 but without other signs of respiratory distress. He had warm and well-perfused extremities, a blood pressure of 102/58 mmHg, and a heart rate of 115 beats per minute. Blood samples, including blood cultures, were collected, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.36, pO2 98 mmHg, pCO2 28 mmHg, HCO3- 18.2 mmol/L, and lactate 2.9 mmol/L. Fluid therapy was initiated, and 2 grams of ceftriaxone were administered. Because of the rapid deterioration, the intensive care unit (ICU) team was called. Upon our evaluation, the patient's condition had worsened, presenting a GCS of 11 (eye 2, verbal 4, motor 5). He was tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute and diaphoretic, with poorly perfused extremities, mottling grade 3, a blood pressure of 82/38 mmHg after receiving 2.5 liters of crystalloids, a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, and a fever of 38.5°C despite having received acetaminophen. The right leg showed significant worsening compared to the initial description by the Internal Medicine team, with hemorrhagic bullae (Figure  The image shows the patient's right leg, displaying hemorrhagic bullae indicated by white arrows, along with marked signs of hypoperfusion and inflammation, including discoloration and edema, in the context of necrotizing fasciitis, highlighted by black arrows. The image shows the patient's right leg, displaying hemorrhagic bullae indicated by a white arrow, along with marked signs of hypoperfusion and inflammation, including discoloration and edema, in the context of necrotizing fasciitis, highlighted by black arrows. The initial complete blood count revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia. Blood chemistries showed acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, rhabdomyolysis, and elevated C-reactive protein.

A: right leg; B: left leg; a: femur; b: extensive subcutaneous tissue edema extending circumferentially around the entire leg; c: mild subcutaneous emphysema; white arrows: fascial thickening The patient underwent orotracheal intubation, and central venous access, arterial line, nasogastric tube, and urinary catheter were placed. Norepinephrine infusion was started, along with hydrocortisone, albumin, crystalloids, 9 grams of piperacillin/tazobactam, 900 mg of clindamycin, and 600 mg of linezolid. The case was discussed with General Surgery, which evaluated the patient and, given the probable diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis or myositis, decided to take him to the operating room for debridement. For just over an hour, the patient remained in the emergency room awaiting transfer to the operating room, during which time there were progression of the inflammatory signs above the knee, doubling of the hemorrhagic bullae in size, development of subcutaneous emphysema, and the appearance of a maculopapular rash on the trunk. After debridement in the operating room (Figure  Over the following two days, the patient required additional surgeries due to the progression of the necrotizing fasciitis to the upper lateral region of the right thigh (Figure  Two days after the transfer, he was extubated and no longer required vasopressor support. Two days later, renal replacement therapy was discontinued. Clindamycin was discontinued after 10 days of treatment, and piperacillin/tazobactam was de-escalated to ceftriaxone after 11 days, which he continued for eight more days. The patient was transferred to the Plastic Surgery ward with the diagnosis of invasive GAS infection with TSS and necrotizing fasciitis and subsequently underwent skin grafting. He was discharged one month later to a rehabilitation center. The patient continues to be followed up by Plastic Surgery and Rehabilitation Medicine. Approximately one year after his hospitalization, the patient is autonomous and has returned to an active adapted lifestyle, including part-time work. He developed a scar formation process with complications, requiring a new graft, which is still in the healing phase. Sepsis is a serious clinical syndrome that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates for patients suffering from it. It is nowadays considered a major public health problem, as it is estimated that it costs more than $20 billion annually for US healthcare systems [ The incidence of GAS infection has been increasing, but in most cases, it is associated with mild disease. Invasive disease is rare, but it carries high morbidity and mortality, making a high level of suspicion crucial for an appropriate approach [ There are numerous risk factors for invasive disease, including HIV infection, intravenous drug use, diabetes mellitus or other forms of immunosuppression, malignancies, burns, trauma, postpartum status, obesity, other viral infections, homelessness, recent surgery, cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, and the use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs [ The term ""fasciitis"" often leads to the misconception that the fascia or muscle aponeurosis must be involved, but in fact, the most common site of infection is the superficial fascia [ In addition to surgical treatment, antibiotic therapy is essential. Empirical treatment should include broad-spectrum coverage, encompassing gram-negative bacteria based on local resistance patterns, as well as methicillin-resistant  The administration of intravenous immunoglobulin is also an appropriate therapy in the presence of TSS, as it appears to significantly reduce its high mortality rate [ HBOT is a medical treatment that delivers 100% oxygen at a pressure of 2-3 absolute atmospheres [ Invasive GAS disease, although rare, has very high morbidity and mortality rates. Its recognition requires a high level of awareness of the condition and is essential for the early involvement of the necessary specialties. The patient's management should include broad-spectrum and anti-toxin antibiotic therapy, along with surgical debridement. Intravenous immunoglobulin has also shown benefits, and while HBOT appears to be advantageous, it should not delay other treatments, particularly surgical debridement. This article describes the clinical case of a young man with no identified risk factors or entry points who developed an invasive GAS infection, rapidly progressing to necrotizing fasciitis and TSS. The swift intervention, including invasive organ support, antibiotic therapy, repeated surgical debridement, and intravenous immunoglobulin, was likely decisive in the patient's favorable outcome. Nevertheless, there was a significant improvement with HBOT, although it is difficult to assess its isolated benefit. It is also important to emphasize that despite all the early interventions, the patient experienced high morbidity due to the need for multiple surgical debridements. One year after the event, the patient is still undergoing skin graft treatments and has not yet fully returned to normal life. On the other hand, his renal function has returned to normal, and he does not appear to have any other significant sequelae.","['emergency medicine', 'group a streptococcus', 'hyperbaric oxygen', 'necrotizing fasciitis', 'streptococcus pyogenes', 'toxic shock']",,Cureus,HIV
11470818,Dual Detection of Hepatitis B and C Viruses Using CRISPR-Cas Systems and Lateral Flow Assay,"The development of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains crucial for effective disease management and control. In this study, we utilized CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems for the detection of HBV (DNA virus) and HCV (RNA virus), respectively. We designed and tested multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting both viruses, confirming successful cleavage of target sequences through gel electrophoresis and a fluorescent reporter assay. Using optimized gRNAs, we developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) for sensitive detection of HBV and HCV, demonstrating a concentration-dependent signal increase. Importantly, no cross-reactivity was observed with other viral targets. To further enhance sensitivity, we employed a dual-enzyme approach, combining Cas12 and Cas13 in a single reaction, which significantly improved detection limits for both viruses. Finally, we developed a dual antigen detection LFA strip capable of simultaneously detecting both HBV and HCV in a single sample. This approach holds promise for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics where the specific viral infection is unknown. This study addresses the current limitations in CRISPR-Cas based diagnostics, namely, the need for ultrasensitive detection methods and the ability to detect multiple antigens using a single test strip. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using CRISPR-Cas systems for highly sensitive and specific detection of HBV and HCV, paving the way for potential POC application.","Emerging infectious diseases, like the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, have underscored the critical need for rapid, accurate, and accessible diagnostic tools [ Viral hepatitis, caused by hepatotropic viruses like hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, poses a substantial global health burden. Among these, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are particularly concerning due to their propensity to cause chronic infections, leading to severe liver diseases and significant mortality rates [ In this study, we leverage the power of CRISPR-Cas systems to develop a diagnostic platform targeting HBV and HCV. We utilize the Cas12a enzyme for HBV (DNA target) and Cas13a for HCV (RNA target), capitalizing on their specific nucleic acid cleavage capabilities. By designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target unique regions within the viral genomes, we aim to achieve highly sensitive and specific detection. In addition to traditional detection methods, we explored the integration of lateral flow assays (LFAs) with smartphone-based analysis, offering a potential route towards user-friendly and portable POC diagnostic. HBV is a DNA virus, whereas HCV contains RNA as its genetic material. To detect these viruses, we utilized CRISPR-Cas12 for HBV and CRISPR-Cas13 for HCV. We designed a series of gRNAs targeting various regions of the HCV and HBV genomes (Figures  Next, we employed a LFA to assess the sensitivity of HCV and HBV detection. Initially, we screened a set of RPA and PCR primers targeting various regions of the HCV and HBV genomes ( Next, we utilized the LFA assay for visual detection of HCV and HBV. To facilitate a clearer understanding of the assay process, a schematic representation of the LFA is provided in  The main challenge in using CRISPR-Cas tools for molecular diagnostics at the point of care is the lower sensitivity of these assays when combined with LFAs [ To determine if a single LFA strip can detect two antigens simultaneously, we developed a dual antigen detection LFA strip ( To simplify this as a POC test, we tested various reaction conditions to detect both HCV and HBV in a single sample. We mixed HBV DNA and HCV RNA in different ratios and performed RT-RPA followed by a dual CRISPR-Cas12/13 reaction in the same tube. To mimic physiological conditions, we used normal healthy control blood spiked with HBV DNA and HCV RNA. Surprisingly, both HBV and HCV were detected in a single reaction sample ( CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized molecular diagnostics due to their high specificity, sensitivity, and versatility [ In this study, we leveraged both Cas12 and Cas13 to develop an ultrasensitive detection platform for HBV and HCV. Cas12 specifically binds to and cleaves double-stranded DNA, indiscriminately cleaving all DNA molecules present in the system upon activation. We utilized Cas12 to specifically recognize HBV DNA and observed a concentration-dependent increase in the signal in both fluorescent readouts and LFAs. Similarly, Cas13 was employed to specifically recognize HCV RNA. However, individually, neither Cas12 nor Cas13 achieved the sensitivity required to detect these pathogens in clinical samples with very low pathogen loads [ To address this, we developed a dual system where both Cas12 and Cas13 were used in a single reaction tube to detect HBV or HCV with much higher sensitivity (0.05 ng/mL) compared to when these enzymes were used individually (0.1 ng/mL). Furthermore, we integrated this dual enzyme reaction with the LFA, which also exhibited higher sensitivity compared to individual enzymes. Thus, this dual enzyme-based reaction provides ultrasensitivity for detecting HCV and HBV. Cas12a has been previously employed for HBV DNA detection, while Cas13a has been utilized for HCV RNA detection, leveraging their distinct collateral cleavage activities to generate detectable signals [ Another challenge with CRISPR-Cas-based molecular diagnostics has been the detection of multiple antigens on a single LFA strip. While some studies have managed to detect multiple antigens using fluorescent and microfluidic systems, this has not been achieved with LFA so far [ Overall, our study demonstrated the feasibility of using Cas12 and Cas13 in a single reaction to enhance the sensitivity of HCV and HBV detection, which otherwise exhibit low detection sensitivity. Additionally, we showed the utility of Cas12 and Cas13 in detecting HCV and HBV in a single reaction on LFA, broadening the application of CRISPR-Cas POC diagnostics beyond a single pathogen. In the future, we anticipate integrating this dual enzyme and dual pathogen detection system with smartphones for user-friendly applications of CRISPR-Cas diagnostics, as previously demonstrated by us [ In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific method for detecting HCV and HBV simultaneously in a single reaction. This dual CRISPR detection system will enhance the ability to diagnose and manage the patient with coinfection of these viruses. We integrated this dual enzyme reaction with the LFA, which also exhibited higher sensitivity compared to individual enzymes and can be performed faster without the need for a sophisticated laboratory setup making it easy for POC applications. To detect HBV and HCV, we designed multiple gRNAs targeting conserved regions of the HBV and HCV genomes (Tables  Synthetic gene fragments for core (HCV) and S (surface antigen of HBV) genes corresponding to the sequences were designed and purchased commercially. The HCV gene fragments will be synthesized along with the T7 promoter sequence. Similarly, synthetic fragments for CMV, HIV and HIN1 were obtained commercially for the desired target gRNA sequence ( The RT-RPA methodology involved designing specific primers and probes targeting conserved regions of the HBV and HCV genomes using the methodology described by us previously [ For the qPCR methodology, specific primers and probes targeting conserved regions of the HBV and HCV genomes were designed. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase, dNTP mix, random hexamers, and reverse transcription buffer. The qPCR reaction mixture included the cDNA template, forward and reverse primers, probe labeled with a fluorophore and quencher, qPCR master mix, and nuclease-free water, totaling 20  For HBV detection, plasmids containing HBV DNA (genotype D) target sequences were synthesized and cloned into a suitable vector. For HCV (genotype 3) detection, in vitro transcription (IVT) was used to generate RNA templates from plasmid DNA containing HCV target sequences. These templates served as targets for gRNA-Cas complexes during initial validation and optimization experiments. Cas12a and Cas13a proteins were expressed and purified using established protocols. The reactions were set up by mixing Cas12a or Cas13a with their corresponding gRNAs. HBV detection used Cas12a-gRNA complexes, and HCV detection used Cas13a-gRNA complexes. The reactions were incubated with target DNA or RNA sequences in a buffer optimized for CRISPR activity. The reaction was performed as described by us previously [ The cleavage activity of gRNA-Cas complexes was validated using gel electrophoresis and fluorescent reporter assays. For gel electrophoresis, reaction products were resolved on agarose gels, and successful cleavage was indicated by the presence of expected DNA or RNA fragments. Fluorescent reporter assays employed FAM-labeled reporter molecules (DNA for Cas12 and RNA for Cas13). The fluorescence increase was monitored using a microplate reader, confirming target cleavage and reporter activation. To optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the detection system, we performed titration experiments with varying concentrations of target nucleic acids. The reaction conditions, including incubation time, temperature, and gRNA to target ratio, were optimized to achieve the best performance. The optimal conditions were used in subsequent LFAs. To enhance detection sensitivity, we combined Cas12a and Cas13a in a single reaction. Synthetic HBV DNA and HCV RNA were mixed with Cas12a and Cas13a complexes, respectively. The dual enzyme reaction was incubated, and the products were applied to the LFA strip (Milenia Biotech). The presence of HBV and HCV was indicated by distinct colored lines on the LFA strip, corresponding to the accumulation of gold nanoparticles at the test and control lines. The specificity of the LFA was assessed using nontarget viral nucleic acids, including CMV DNA, HIV RNA, and H1N1 RNA. These controls ensured no cross-reactivity with nontarget sequences. Sensitivity was determined by testing serial dilutions of synthetic HBV DNA and HCV RNA, with detection limits established by the lowest concentration yielding a visible LFA signal. The reporter molecule was developed for colorimetric detection using LFA, based on a previously published method [ LFA signals were quantified using an ImageJ analysis platform, converting the visual signal into numerical data for comparison with qPCR results as described by us previously [ To test the dual detection capability, we used blood serum samples obtained from the healthy donors and spiked with known concentrations of HBV DNA and HCV RNA. Samples were processed and subjected to the dual enzyme reaction followed by LFA detection. The assay's robustness was confirmed by consistent detection of both viruses in mixed and individual samples. Statistical analysis of the samples was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used for correlation analysis. Nonparametric ",[],2024-10-5,Journal of Nucleic Acids,HIV

Pulmonary, intestinal, bone marrow, and retinal involvement have also been described. Diagnosis of cryptococcal lymphadenitis remains a potential challenge as it can be subclinical with a lack of characteristic clinical and radiological features.  Although many cases of cryptococcal infection worldwide have been reported in other organs, it is sporadic to diagnose cryptococcal infection in lymph nodes by FNAC. The minimally invasive nature of FNAC, coupled with its ability to provide quick results and guide treatment decisions through smears and cultures, makes it a patient-friendly and efficient addition to routine diagnostic practices. Lymph-node FNAC represents a first-line diagnostic option for immunocompromised patients presenting with a wide range of potential diagnoses. This approach holds promise for definitive diagnoses and timely treatment initiation. The definitive diagnosis of this case of cryptococcosis was possible only because of the simple, cost-effective technique of FNAC, which prompted the early initiation of specific and life-saving treatment.","['cerebrospinal fluid (csf)', 'cryptococcus neoformans', 'fine needle aspiration cytology', 'lymphadenitis', 'lymph node']",,Cureus,HIV
11470748,Vaccine hesitancy in context of COVID-19 in East Africa: systematic review and meta-analysis,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a significant impact on human lives, and the development of effective vaccines has been a promising solution to bring an end to the pandemic. However, the success of a vaccination program heavily relies on a significant portion of the population being vaccinated. Recent studies have indicated a rise in vaccine hesitancy over time and inconsistent factors affecting it. This study aimed to synthesis of the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and associated factors among various communities in East Africa. The review encompassed relevant descriptive and observational studies conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 26, 2023. We browsed various databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, African online Journal, cross-references, and Web of Science. After extracted and exported to R the data analysis was performed using R version 4.2. Meta-package were used to estimate the pooled prevalence and factors of vaccine hesitancy. Publication bias was assessed through funnel plots, Egger's test, and trim-and-fill methods. After carefully screening an initial pool of 53,984 studies, a total of 79 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 40.40% (95% CI: 35.89%; 45.47%, I Approximately four out of ten individuals in this region express hesitancy towards vaccination. A tailored approach that considers the socio-demographic context could significantly reduce this hesitancy. To achieve high vaccination coverage, a comprehensive strategy is essential, necessitating substantial social, scientific, and health efforts. The success of vaccination campaigns within this population relies on the widespread and consistent implementation of effective interventions.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global health emergency and later a pandemic. Over 5 million confirmed cases and around 100,000 deaths have been reported in Africa alone [ Vaccine hesitancy refers to the reluctance or refusal to accept vaccinations, even when they are readily available [ The global prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has varied from region to region (36% in Africa to 83% Oceania) [ The global hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines is a significant concern [ Global efforts to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and reduce its health and socio-economic impacts heavily rely on preventive measures [ Data on vaccine hesitancy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including East Africa, has been sparse [ To date, most systematic reviews and meta-analyses on COVID-19 vaccination have primarily focused on vaccine acceptance and rejection rates [ This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to ensure a rigorous selection and reporting of studies. This review has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO and the ID of this systematic review and meta-analysis: CRD42024501415. This systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline [ The systematic review employed two approaches, namely CoCoPop (condition, context, and population) and PICOS (population, exposure of interest, and outcome or response, Study type), to determine which studies to include. Any papers that did not meet these criteria were classified as irrelevant. The included studies had all study design and focused on the hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in the general population. Only papers published in English until December 26, 2023, were considered for this review and meta-analysis. The quality of each article was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, and all articles successfully passed the quality assessment. We have excluded studies related to COVID-19 that focus on animal experimentation, reviews, commentaries, letters to the editors, studies where raw data cannot be analyzed, and protocols specifically conducted in East Africa. After conducting a thorough search and gathering various articles, we proceeded to remove any duplicate files. This screening process was carried out in two stages: first, by evaluating the titles and abstracts, and then by conducting a full-text screening were done by two authors. To ensure accuracy, two independent reviewers utilized the EndNote software to assess the potential relevance of each article for further review. The assessment was based on a predetermined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In cases where there were discrepancies between the reviewers' assessments, they were resolved through discussion and by consulting a third reviewer. For audit purposes, electronic records were maintained for both the included and excluded studies, with clear explanations provided for any exclusions made. The study's risk of bias was assessed using a validated quality assessment checklist for prevalence studies developed by Hoy and colleagues[ The information was obtained by utilizing a Microsoft Excel template for data extraction. Two authors (MSA and DG) independently extracted the data using a standardized data extraction form. The form underwent iterative testing and revision as necessary. It encompassed various key details, such as the first name of the primary author, publication year, country, study design, survey duration, participants, sample size, response rate, prevalence (reported hesitancy), and factors influencing hesitancy. World Health Organization (WHO) declared vaccine hesitancy as ‘the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines’ [ The study assessed participants' attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine using ten attitude-related questions, each rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The scale assigned values as follows: 1 for ""strongly disagree,"" 2 for ""disagree,"" 3 for ""neutral,"" 4 for ""agree,"" and 5 for ""strongly agree."" Participants who answered 80% or more of the attitude questions were classified as having a ""positive attitude,"" while those who did not meet this threshold were categorized as having a ""negative attitude"" [ Based on summative score above the mean considered as adequate preventive practice and below the mean score is not adequate prevention practices [ When analyzing research studies, it is important to consider the possibility of publication bias, which can skew the results. Two common methods for evaluating publication bias are funnel plots and Egger's test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is typically used as a threshold for determining statistical significance in detecting publication bias. To evaluate the variability in reported prevalence among studies, researchers use statistical tests such as I A meticulous sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of individual studies on the overall estimation of prevalence. Each study was systematically removed, and the subsequent impact on the estimate was closely observed. The exclusion of any single study did not yield a significant effect on the pooled prevalence estimate. Moreover, none of the studies deviated beyond the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval. This suggests that the collective findings of the studies remained robust and consistent, reinforcing the reliability of the overall prevalence estimate. The data extracted from individual articles was processed using Microsoft Excel 2013 and then exported to R software version 4.2 for further analysis. The analysis focused on 79 individual studies to determine the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy among general population in East Africa. Due to high heterogeneity among the studies (I This systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline [ PRISMA based flow chart shows study selection process for systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine in East Africa A total of 79 studies were included in this analysis. Out of these, 37 studies were conducted in Ethiopia [ Descriptive presentation of the study included in systematic review and meta-analysis The study analyzed the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance in all population groups from 79 publications in east Africa. Finally, 79 studies were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. The current systematic review reports studies from the following different geographical areas: Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Somali, Sudan, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe. The findings showed that the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance in east Africa was estimated at 40.40%, (95% CI: 35.89%; 45.47, I Shows forest plot for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in East Africa This study investigated research conducted in East Africa regarding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, analyzing 79 records from various countries in the region. The findings revealed that the pooled prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in Ethiopia was estimated at 46.79% (95% CI: 41.69%–52.51%), with a p-value of less than 0.001. This indicates that, on average, approximately 46.79% of the population in Ethiopia expresses hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Similarly, in Tanzania, the pooled prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was found to be 51.73% (95% CI: 37.57%–71.24%), with a p-value of less than 0.01. This suggests that around 51.73% of the population experienced hesitancy regarding the COVID-19 vaccine when it became available. These findings highlight significant disparities in vaccine hesitancy across different countries. The study also assessed hesitancy among various populations. Among healthcare workers, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was recorded at 30.99% (95% CI: 23.09%–41.60%), with a high heterogeneity (I Sub-group analysis of the study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy Others: chronic illness patients, peoples living with HIV, refuges The analysis of the funnel plot investigating the impact of smaller studies on the overall COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in east Africa indicates the presence of a small-study effect. The observed asymmetry in the plot provides supporting evidence for this conclusion. Moreover, the results of Egger's test, with a p-value of less than 0.001, further strengthen this finding. For a visual representation of the funnel plot, please refer to supplementary Fig. 1. Based on meta-bias analysis result neither publication year nor sample size was found to be statistically significant sources of heterogeneity. The meta-regression analysis result showed that the sample size was not a significant source of heterogeneity (Table  Meta-regression analysis of factors affecting between-study heterogeneity vaccine hesitancy This systematic review and meta-analysis examined seventeen studies to explore factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in East Africa. The findings highlighted several key factors linked to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, while others—such as rural residence, age over 49, higher educational levels, and individual perceived benefits—were not significantly associated during the meta-analysis. The factors that showed a significant association included being under 40 years of age, female gender, inadequate preventive practices, reliance on the web/internet for information, negative attitudes toward the vaccine, uncertainty about vaccine safety, fear of adverse effects, doubts about contracting COVID-19, and beliefs in conspiracy myths. In the analysis of individuals under 40 years, five studies were pooled, revealing a low statistical heterogeneity (I Additionally, the analysis of four studies showed that individuals with inadequate preventive practices were more likely to hesitate in getting vaccinated compared to those with adequate practices. The pooled results indicated that individuals with inadequate preventive practices were 2.26 times more likely to hesitate about vaccination (POR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.33; 3.84; I Moreover, data from four studies revealed that individuals with a negative attitude toward vaccines were significantly more likely to exhibit hesitancy compared to those with a positive attitude. Specifically, individuals with negative attitudes were 3.14 times more likely to hesitate regarding COVID-19 vaccination (POR = 3.14; 95% CI: 1.23; 8.02; I Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in East Africa This study represents the first comprehensive review and meta-analysis conducted to explore the extent and factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in East Africa. The findings of this research hold significant value for various stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare policymakers and implementers, government officials, communities, and healthcare professionals. According to the systematic review and meta-analysis, the estimated pooled prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in East Africa is 40.40% (95% CI: 35.89%; 45.47, I This systematic review and meta-analysis finding was comparable with the systematic review conducted in Canada with prevalence of hesitancy was 42.3% [ This systematic review and meta-analysis identify different factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In this study, we found an association between certain socio-demographic variables, such as being under the age of 40 and being female, with vaccine hesitancy. This finding aligns with the findings of previous studies conducted by Prabani et al. (2022) in Canada, the United States, and Italy, which also indicated that females had a higher rate of vaccine hesitancy [ In this study female sex were associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Females were more likely hesitate to vaccination as compared with male. This finding is aligns with the study conducted by Zintel et al. [ In this study we identified the significant correlation between a negative attitude and vaccine hesitancy, which showed that individuals who possess a negative attitude being 3.14 times more likely to hesitate as compared with individuals with positive attitude. This finding supports the results of a previous systematic review conducted in the United States, which demonstrated that negative attitudes can increase an individual's level of vaccine hesitancy [ In this study individuals who had never perceived themselves as being at risk of contracting COVID-19 were found to be 2.54 times more likely to hesitate when it came to getting vaccinated. This finding aligns with a similar study conducted in the United States [ In this study the myth of conspiracy was identified as a significant factor in vaccine hesitancy. Individuals who believed in conspiracy theories were found to be 1.94 times more likely to hesitate in getting vaccinated against COVID-19. This finding was consistent with similar studies conducted in the US [ This systematic review and meta-analysis faced several limitations. Firstly, it included only studies published in English, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, certain variables related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were excluded from the analysis because they were reported in only one primary article. Additionally, the study relied solely on cross-sectional data, limiting the ability to establish cause-and-effect relationships. To address these limitations, future researchers are encouraged to incorporate longitudinal studies and qualitative research into their investigations. The findings of this study carry significant clinical and public health implications for addressing the high rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The relevance of this research suggests that targeted public health interventions aimed at the factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy could greatly enhance vaccine uptake among the general population. Additionally, these findings are crucial for managing vaccine wastage and optimizing resource use in the region, as they help identify barriers to vaccination prior to its distribution. Moreover, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the need for designing regional interventions and programs tailored to the identified factors. Furthermore, the study's results are vital for researchers, healthcare leaders, policymakers, program developers, and healthcare providers, as they collaboratively work to devise strategies to prevent and mitigate the consequences of vaccine hesitancy in East Africa. Vaccine hesitancy towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is a prevailing issue in East Africa. Approximately four out of ten individuals in this region express hesitancy towards vaccination. Several significant factors have been identified through systematic analysis and meta-analysis, including being female and under 40 years old, inadequate prevention practices, relying on web/internet as a source of information, having a negative attitude towards the vaccine, uncertainty about vaccine safety, fear of adverse effects, uncertainty about contracting COVID-19, and belief in conspiracy myths. To achieve high vaccination coverage, a comprehensive approach is needed, requiring significant social, scientific, and health efforts. The success of vaccination campaigns in this population depends on widespread and consistent implementation of interventions. Furthermore, strategies developed to address vaccine hesitancy related to COVID-19 can be adapted to combat hesitancy towards vaccinations in general. Public health institutions should take into account the findings of this meta-analysis and the recommendations put forth by various authors focusing on this topic. By doing so, they can effectively manage vaccine hesitancy and develop optimal strategies for education and communication campaigns. These efforts aim to enhance population confidence, ensure vaccine safety, and foster trust in vaccinations.

11470662,"Examining concordance of sexual-related factors and PrEP eligibility with HIV risk perception among adolescent girls and young women: cross-sectional insights from DREAMS sites in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia","HIV risk perception is an important cognition for prevention, theoretically engendering service-seeking and risk-reduction behaviors, but its composition remains poorly understood. We examined country-specific correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk among sexually active adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, aged 15–24 years) without HIV in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. We also explored overlaps between self-appraised HIV exposure risk and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility to identify engagement opportunities. We analyzed cross-sectional data (2016/2017) to estimate sexual-related correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk (likely vs. not, temporally framed as “ever”) using log-Poisson models with robust standard errors. For sexual-related factors with an unadjusted  Few AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya [ AGYW's HIV risk perceptions were mostly influenced by factors beyond their locus of control. Conditional PrEP eligibility criteria may inhibit AGYW’s access and uptake in some settings: countries should consider decoupling these factors to minimize barriers. Intersections between autonomy, behaviors, and perceptions among AGYW in gender-inequitable settings warrants further investigation.

In 2015, once-daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) became the first prevention method AGYW could use without partner cooperation, but initiation, adherence, and continuation remains low due to pill burden, side effect concerns, and stigma [ Despite their heightened risk for HIV acquisition, AGYW do not reliably use HIV prevention services and methods [ Improving AGYW’s HIV prevention outcomes necessitates understanding of the behaviors, circumstances, and experiences that influence how they perceive their risk of HIV acquisition. However, the underpinnings of AGYW’s HIV risk perception are rarely examined, highlighting its formulation is poorly understood. Illuminating these factors could inform activities and interventions to improve AGYW’s access, initiation, and effective use of HIV prevention services and methods, including PrEP [ This secondary analysis used cross-sectional data collected from AGYW residing in DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe) study sites in urban/peri-urban Kenya (2016–2017), rural Malawi (2017), and urban Zambia (2016–2017) during DREAMS’ pre-intervention phase. Briefly, DREAMS was a multi-component and -sectoral partnership to reduce AGYW’s HIV risk by implementing a suite of interventions targeting AGYW, families, partners, and communities [ To focus on HIV prevention, the samples included AGYW who self-reported being HIV negative and having sex in the last 12 months (sexually active). In Zambia, the sample comprised those currently having sex at the time of the interview due to questionnaire skip logic. Supplemental Material 1 presents the definitions for all study measures. We measured HIV risk perception using self-appraised likelihood of HIV exposure, ""how likely it is that you have been exposed to HIV?"", a question asked after all HIV-related risk modules, facilitating a retrospective assessment. We operationalized response categories as Likely (very likely, somewhat likely) vs. Unlikely (unlikely, not at all), excluding participants with missing or “don’t know” responses [ To identify variables for multivariable control, we explored sociodemographic factors, encompassing age group (adolescent girls, aged 15–19 years [AG] vs. young women, aged 20–24 years [YW]); ever-pregnant, orphanhood, out-of-school, employment, marital, and socio-economic status (SES); hunger; location; and DREAMS enrollee status. We assessed anxiety/depression symptoms and comprehensive HIV knowledge because they can vary risk perception [ First, we examined HIV-associated behaviors, including inconsistent condom use, STI symptoms, age-disparate and inter-generational sex, transactional sex, multiple sexual partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use. Next, we assessed relationship characteristics: partner(s)’ 1) community residence, 2) other partners, 3) HIV status, and 4) likely HIV exposure. Finally, we investigated respondents' survivorship of physical and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner sexual violence. PrEP eligibility was measured using criteria in each country’s national guidelines. Below, we outline the criteria for each country, followed by analytic definitions in parentheses. Kenya’s criteria included multiple partners (multiple partners), condomless sex (inconsistent condom use), partners’ unknown HIV status (does not know partner[s] HIV status), any partners at risk of HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), STI diagnosis (STI symptoms in last 6 months), received money/material support for sex (transactional sex), survived forced sex or physical assault (survived non-partner sexual violence or physical or sexual IPV), and history of sex while under the influence of drugs/alcohol (alcohol use) [ For Malawi, eligibility criteria comprised having an STI in the last 6 months (STI symptoms in last 6 months), giving/receiving monetary incentives for sex (transactional sex), and having an age-disparate partner and ever being pregnant (positive indications for both ever-pregnant and age-disparate sex, as defined by national guidelines) [ In Zambia, criteria encompassed sex with multiple partners without condoms (positive indications for both multiple partners and inconsistent condom use, as defined by national guidelines), partner has HIV/at substantial risk of acquiring HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), history of STIs (STI symptoms in last 6 months), and prior post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use (ever used PEP) [ We could not include sero-different partnership dynamics (Kenya, Malawi, Zambia), sharing injection materials (Kenya, Zambia), or PEP use (Kenya) due to questionnaire limitations. We operationalized PrEP eligibility as a binary measure (≥ 1 criteria versus None). For Malawi and Zambia, we also explored eligibility by decoupling their conditional criteria (e.g., Malawi: age-disparate sex and ever-pregnant, Zambia: multiple partners and inconsistent condom use). We examined country-specific correlates of likely HIV exposure, the dependent variable, using prevalence ratios (log-Poisson models, robust standard errors) generated with R (v.4.4.0) [ We descriptively explored intersections between HIV risk, PrEP eligibility, and risk perception by assessing PrEP eligibility among AGYW with ≥ 1 sexual-related risk factor and describing the proportion of AGYW reporting likely HIV exposures by PrEP eligibility status. Overall, 5364 eligible AGYW in Kenya ( Across countries, most respondents were YW (Kenya: 72.7%, Malawi: 72.3%, Zambia: 79.4%) who had ever been pregnant (Kenya: 74.7%, Malawi: 94.8%, Zambia: 67.3%; Tables  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Kenya Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  Nearly all respondents (Kenya: 98.7%, Malawi: 99.8%, Zambia: 98.9%) reported at least one sexual-related HIV-associated factor. Inconsistent condom use was the most prevalent HIV-associated behavior in all countries (Kenya: 75.3%, Malawi: 93.9%, Zambia: 74.8%). Violence survivorship (Kenya: 48.4%, Malawi: 37.5%, Zambia: 45.3%) and age-disparate sex (Kenya: 43.8%, Malawi: 33.4%, Zambia: 57.8%) were also prevalent. Believing partner(s) were likely exposed to HIV was particularly common in Malawi (Kenya: 16.0%, Malawi: 58.1%, Zambia: 8.3%). Table  After controlling for these sociodemographic and cognitive factors, correlates of likely HIV exposures included STI symptoms (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR] = 1.44 [1.03–2.01]) and partner(s)’ non-community residence (APR = 1.40 [1.00–1.95]), other partners (APR = 2.23 [1.51–3.28]), unknown status (APR = 1.81 [1.24–2.63]), and likely HIV exposure (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.82 [1.06–3.14], Yes: APR = 5.77 [3.95–8.43], ref: No). Table  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Malawi Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  After adjustment, transactional sex (APR = 1.37 [1.13–1.66]); multiple sex partners (APR = 1.21 [1.02–1.44]); alcohol use (APR = 1.22 [1.03–1.45]); partner(s)’ other partners (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.29 [1.13–1.47], Yes: APR = 1.43 [1.24–1.65], ref: No), unknown status (APR = 1.16 [1.02–1.33]), and likely HIV exposure (Yes: APR = 2.86 [2.40–3.41], ref: No); and physical (APR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) and sexual (APR = 1.56 [1.39–1.75]) IPV emerged as correlates.

This PrEP eligibility examination decouples these conditional criteria and treats each factor as their own criterion N/A = Not applicable because Kenya had no conditional PrEP criteria in their national guidelines In the PrEP eligibility column, Dark Blue indicates PrEP-eligible, and Dark Orange represents PrEP-ineligible. In the self-appraised HIV exposure column, Blue highlights self-reported likely HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW, whereas Light Blue represents unlikely exposures in this same group; Orange indicates likely HIV exposures among PrEP-ineligible AGYW, while Light Orange reflects unlikely exposures in the same classification Self-appraised likely HIV exposures were relatively low among PrEP-eligible AGYW (Kenya: 16.5%, Malawi: 48.5%, Zambia: 18.8%). Also, few PrEP-ineligible AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya: 6.4%, Malawi: 43.7%, Zambia: 4.8%). While Malawi’s and Zambia’s decoupled PrEP criteria did not proportionally increase self-appraised HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW (46.5% and 9.6%, respectively), the number of AGYW falling within these categories respectively increased by 74.4% and 31.8%. In this study with sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, self-reported likely HIV exposures were uncommon amid ubiquitous HIV risk (i.e., reporting ≥ 1 HIV risk factor). Correlates of likely HIV exposure primarily related to factors beyond respondents’ locus of control, spanning partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure (all countries), other partners (Kenya, Malawi), unknown status (Kenya, Malawi), non-community residence (Kenya); physical and sexual IPV (Malawi); and non-partner sexual violence (Zambia). Other correlates included STI symptoms in Kenya and transactional sex, multiple partners, and pre-coital alcohol use in Malawi. Exploring overlaps between HIV risk perception and PrEP eligibility highlighted that Kenya’s criteria captured most at-risk AGYW. Decoupling conditional criteria in Malawi’s (age-disparate sex + ever-pregnant) and Zambia’s (multiple partners + condomless sex) guidelines could improve risk identification. Self-reported likely HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligibility groupings, but decoupling Malawi’s criteria could increase PrEP engagement opportunities. Without improving AGYW’s actual-perceived risk disconnect, HIV prevention services and interventions will remain underutilized. Partnership-related factors, primarily in Kenya and Malawi, influenced AGYW’s HIV risk perception most, specifically partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, having other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence. Other studies also found partners’ behaviors and characteristics influence AGYW’s HIV risk perception [ Concordant with HIV risk research, AGYW’s survivorship of IPV and non-partner violence also affected HIV risk perceptions [ The remaining associative factors in Malawi—transactional sex, multiple partnerships, pre-coital alcohol use—and Kenya, STI symptoms, also aligned with epidemiologic data [ We found self-appraised HIV exposures were low in PrEP-eligible and -ineligible AGYW, suggesting most PrEP-eligible respondents are unlikely to seek out PrEP [ Our analysis supports that criteria-based eligibility might prevent sexually active AGYW from receiving the care and/or interventions necessary to reduce their HIV risk. By decoupling their conditional PrEP criteria, Malawi and Zambia could correctly identify > 85% of at-risk AGYW and potentially increase PrEP interactions by ~ 70% and ~ 30%, respectively [ In ESA, PrEP availability and accessibility has increased significantly over the past decade due to national governments partnering with bi- and multilateral partners, like the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) [ Our study has some limitations. We could not fully measure physical and sexual IPV in Kenya and Zambia due to questionnaire limitations: our null findings might misrepresent actual associations. Zambia’s models are possibly overfitted given the small number of events. Surveys did not measure or fully capture serodifferent relationships, injection drug use, PEP use (Kenya), and violence (Kenya, Zambia); thus, the number of PrEP-eligible AGYW might be underrepresented. Also, surveys used a 12-month recall period for most measures, while guidelines use a 6-month period, potentially inflating estimates of PrEP-eligible AGYW. Since all the data were self-reported, including HIV status, our data were potentially affected by social desirability, which could have attenuated effects and associations. Sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia are at increased risk for HIV. HIV risk perception could motivate AGYW to seek out, access, and use HIV prevention services and interventions, but AGYW’s low HIV risk perception often contradicts their actual HIV risk. In examining correlates of AGYW’s HIV risk perception, we discovered extrinsic factors—partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence; and physical and sexual violence from partners and non-partners—primarily increased AGYW’s HIV risk perception. Transactional sex, multiple partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use also increased Malawian AGYW’s risk perception, as did STI symptoms in Kenyan AGYW. Complementary analyses of overlaps between PrEP eligibility and risk perception highlighted self-appraised HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligible and -ineligible categorizations. To meaningfully increase access and use of HIV prevention services and interventions, improvements in AGYW’s HIV risk appraisal, identification, and perception are needed; deeper examination of the interplay between agency, behaviors, and perceptions would advance this goal. Otherwise, their current suboptimal utilization of HIV prevention services and methods will persist.

11470597,Infectious disease events in people with HIV receiving kidney transplantation: Analysis of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study,"Since the implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy, kidney transplantation (K-Tx) has become a valuable option for treatment of end-stage kidney disease for people with HIV (PWH) with similar patient and graft survival as compared to HIV-uninfected patients. Little is known about the hazards and manifestations of infectious disease (ID) events occurring in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. Using linked information collected in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), we described in-depth demographical and clinical characteristics of PWH who received a K-Tx since 2008. Further, we performed recurrent time to event analyses to understand whether HIV was an independent risk factor for ID events. Overall, 24 PWH with 57 ID events were included in this study (100% match of SHCS to STCS). Of these, 17 (70.8%) patients had at least one ID event: 22 (38.6%) viral (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, one (1.8%) fungal and 16 (28.1%) probable infections. Most ID events affected the respiratory tract (25, 37.3%) or the urinary tract (13, 19.4%). Pathogen types and infection sites were similar in PWH and a matched control group of HIV-uninfected patients. HIV was not an independent risk factor for ID events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94,  By linking data from two large national Swiss cohorts, we provided in-depth information on ID events in PWH receiving a K-Tx in Switzerland. HIV infection was not associated with an increased hazard for ID events after K-Tx. In a matched analysis based on longitudinal data from the Swiss HIV and Transplant Cohort Studies including all people with HIV who received a kidney transplantation, HIV was not an independent risk factor for infectious disease events post-transplant.","Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk to experience life-threatening infectious disease (ID) events post-transplant [ For a long time, an HIV infection was considered a contraindication for receiving a SOT. However, since implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and continuous improvement of care for people with HIV (PWH) leading to a recovery of the immune system, transplantation in PWH became a valuable option for treatment of end-stage organ disease. The patient and graft survival was shown to be comparable to people without HIV [ In this study, we linked data collected in two representative nation-wide cohort studies in Switzerland, the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). Our main study hypothesis was that kidney transplant recipients with HIV are more prone to ID events after transplantation as compared to kidney transplant recipients without HIV. Hence, our main aim was to compare the occurrence of ID events with a matched control group of HIV-uninfected kidney transplant recipients. Further, we aimed to provide a comprehensive characterisation of ID events in kidney transplant recipients with HIV including detailed information on HIV-specific parameters, such as ART regimen and viral loads. The Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), a multicentric cohort study established in 2008, covers information on more than 93% of all solid organ transplant recipients in Switzerland [ The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) is a nationwide longitudinal cohort study enrolling adult people with HIV (PWH) living in Switzerland. The cohort study was established in 1988 and covers approximately 70% of all people ever diagnosed with HIV in Switzerland, with cumulatively more than 21’000 participants [ All PWH with a K-Tx between 2008 and 2022 registered in the SHCS were identified and linked with the respective study identifier in the STCS, in order to obtain detailed information on both, HIV-related parameters and transplant-related parameters. Linkage was performed using the birthdate, transplantation date and further demographic and clinical variables available in both cohort studies. For unclear cases, the treating physician was consulted, and the original medical chart was revised, leading to an unambiguous link for all cases. All cases with a minimal follow-up of at least 30 days after transplantation were included in the analysis. To understand the impact of an HIV infection on the occurrence of ID events, we matched a comparison group of people without HIV: we first identified all STCS participants who underwent a kidney transplantation at the age of 18 or older, with a follow-up of at least 30 days after transplantation. Further, we removed all PWH from this population (the participants already matched with the SHCS, as well as 4 individuals with HIV but not registered in the SHCS). We then matched a control group with a 1:3 ratio based on age at transplantation, sex, and calendar year of transplantation. Sex was defined as biological sex assigned at birth and categorised as male or female. Ethnicity was grouped into Caucasian, African, or Asian. Age was reported as a continuous variable in Table

The observation time starts at the day of transplantation until the last follow-up information. The matched control group was generated by randomly choosing three patients from the potential control group (i.e., HIV-uninfected, same sex, same transplantation year, difference in age at transplantation being less than 3 years) using the R function  We identified 24 PWH who received a K-Tx in Switzerland since 2008 (Table  Overall, 57 ID events were reported for 17 (70.8%) patients: 22 (38.6%) viral infections (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, 16 (28.1%) probable infections and one probable fungal infection (see Fig.

 Pathogen types and infections site of all infectious disease events reported for people with HIV receiving a kidney transplantation. Potentially opportunistic infections are indicated with * The matched control group ( In this study, we provide a comprehensive description of a representative sample of PWH receiving K-Tx in Switzerland in the years 2008 until 2022. Using the strength of two nation-wide longitudinal prospective cohort studies, one enrolling people receiving solid organ transplantations and one enrolling PWH, we were able to provide a detailed description of infectious complications post-transplant (recorded in the STCS) as well as HIV-specific clinical information (recorded in the SHCS). The main finding is that despite the potential detrimental effect of the chronic HIV infection on the immune system at the time of transplantation, PWH did not experience higher rates of infectious complications. The pathogen types and infection sites were mostly comparable, even when restricting to infections requiring hospitalisation or potentially opportunistic infections, respectively. At the time of transplantation, the median CD4 cell count was 385 cells/mm In the present study, viral infections were the most common ID events in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. In the subset of ID events requiring hospitalisation, bacterial infections predominated. This finding is in line with prior studies reporting a large proportion of bacterial infections among ID events requiring hospitalisation or even intensive care support of kidney transplant recipients with HIV [ In the comparison of causative pathogens, BKPyV infections were more frequent in the HIV-negative control group, the reasons for this difference being unclear. Among polyomaviruses, JC virus (JCPyV) infections with the clinical presentation of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is most often seen in PWH [ A survival benefit for PWH with end-stage renal disease who received a K-Tx has been previously reported [ Strengths of the present study are the multi-centric design and the use of prospective, comprehensive data collection of two cohort studies. Both cohort studies share a large degree of representability for Switzerland. In particular, the STCS includes basic information on all solid organ transplantations in Switzerland since 2008, with a consent rate of 93% for reusing the information for research purposes [ Our findings strengthen the current guidelines of HIV not being a contraindication for transplantation. Evaluation of PWH for K-Tx seemed to differ from HIV-uninfected patients with end stage kidney disease, e.g. all PWH received renal replacement prior to K-Tx, whereas in the control group several pre-emptive K-Tx were performed. A harmonisation in evaluation strategies between PWH and HIV-uninfected patients should be considered. Further research and a higher sample size is needed to understand potentially yet unrevealed differences in ID events after transplantation in PWH compared to HIV-uninfected patients. Linkage of national transplantation registries and HIV cohorts are crucial to obtain these insights.","['Kidney transplantation', 'HIV', 'Infectious disease events']",2024-10-11,BMC Infectious Diseases,HIV
11470487,A Case Report of Malakoplakia of the Gallbladder: A Diagnostic Challenge and Pathological Surprise,"Malakoplakia, a rare granulomatous inflammatory condition, typically manifests in the genitourinary system. Its occurrence in the gallbladder is exceptionally uncommon, posing significant diagnostic challenges. A 68-year-old male presented with recurrent epigastric pain, and a suspicious gallbladder mass was found on imaging. He then underwent surgery due to concerns for malignancy. Histopathology of the surgical specimen revealed malakoplakia, highlighting the diagnostic dilemma encountered in such instances.","Malakoplakia is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disorder that affects many organs, like the urinary bladder (most common), kidney, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and lymph nodes. It is characterized by histiocytic infiltrates with eosinophilic cytoplasm and basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions containing iron and calcium known as Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, which are pathognomonic but not essential to make the diagnosis [ Our case  A 68-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents, presented with a 9-month history of recurrent epigastric pain. The pain was colicky in nature, occurring from once every month to once every 5-10 days, with moderate to severe intensity. It did not radiate to the back and was relieved by intravenous analgesics. He also reported associated dyspepsia but no vomiting, fever, jaundice, or change in bowel habits. Investigations Laboratory tests revealed a normal complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) was elevated at 409.8 U/mL. Ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen (Figure  FDG: Fluorodeoxyglucose F 18; PET CT: Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; SUV: Standardized Uptake Value. FDG: Fluorodeoxyglucose F 18; PET: Positron Emission Tomography. Surgery and histopathology The patient underwent an extended cholecystectomy with wedge resection of the liver. There were dense adhesions between the gallbladder and liver. On gross examination of the cut surgical specimen, a thickened gallbladder wall was noted. Histopathological microscopic examination (Figure  Postoperative course The patient had a prolonged postoperative course due to persistent serous drainage from a subhepatic drain, likely secondary to extensive lymph node dissection. The drain was removed on postoperative day 16. He recovered well and was discharged with no fresh complaints. The patient has been under follow-up since last year and he has had no complaints. Malakoplakia, a chronic inflammatory disorder, presents a diagnostic challenge due to its ability to involve various organs and mimic more common pathologies. Due to its presentation on imaging as a thickened gallbladder, the differential diagnoses include carcinoma of the gallbladder, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, and chronic cholecystitis [ The name, derived from the Greek words 'malakos' (soft) and 'plakos' (plaque), reflects the soft, yellow-brown plaques or nodules typically observed. On microscopy, it is characterized by sheets of histiocytes with granular cytoplasm (von Hansemann cells) and basophilic round to oval intracellular inclusions, known as Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. This is all set against a backdrop of mixed inflammatory cell infiltration. Classical Michaelis-Gutmann bodies are pathognomonic, although not necessary for diagnosis. The urinary tract is the most commonly affected site, followed by the gastrointestinal tract [ The exact cause of malakoplakia remains unclear, although it is believed to be linked to a dysfunctional immune response (as seen in HIV, immunosuppression, and cancer) to bacterial infections. The bacteria commonly implicated are E. coli, M. tuberculosis, Proteus, and S. aureus. It is postulated that in immunosuppressed states, the local macrophages are unable to digest the phagocytosed bacteria. These partially digested bacteria lead to the deposition of calcium and iron on the residual bacterial glycolipid, forming basophilic inclusion bodies called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies [ The clinical presentation of malakoplakia is highly dependent on the affected organ. In the genitourinary tract, it can manifest as recurrent urinary tract infections, dysuria, and hematuria [ The rarity of malakoplakia, particularly in the gallbladder, makes preoperative diagnosis difficult. Imaging studies like ultrasound, CT scans, and PET scans may be suggestive of a mass lesion, but they lack specificity [ The optimal treatment strategy for malakoplakia remains debatable. Traditionally, long-term antibiotic therapy targeting the identified organism has been the mainstay of treatment [ Our case report provides valuable insights into the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and potential aggressiveness of gallbladder malakoplakia. The patient’s presentation with non-specific symptoms, such as recurrent epigastric pain, and the elevation of CA-19-9, a tumor marker, highlights the difficulty in differentiating this rare condition from malignancy. Histopathologic examination can help in solving this diagnostic challenge. Moreover, the case emphasizes the potential for extensive local disease involvement in gallbladder malakoplakia, as evidenced by the patient's prolonged postoperative course due to dense adhesions and lymph node involvement. This finding suggests that aggressive surgical management may be necessary in certain cases. While the absence of identified pathogens in this instance contributes to the ongoing debate about the etiology of malakoplakia, it also highlights the need for further research into the pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease. The limitations we faced include the lack of classical Michaelis-Gutmann bodies in our case and the limited literature on this disease. Overall, this case report expands our understanding of gallbladder malakoplakia and emphasizes the importance of considering this rare diagnosis in patients presenting with gallbladder pathology, particularly when faced with atypical clinical and radiological findings. Malakoplakia of the gallbladder is a rare but important consideration in the differential diagnosis of a thickened gallbladder wall, particularly when malignancy cannot be definitively excluded by imaging studies. Histopathological examination is essential for diagnosis. While the optimal treatment approach for gallbladder malakoplakia requires further elucidation, surgical resection appears to be a viable option, especially in cases of localized disease.","['adenocarcinoma of gall bladder', 'elevated ca 19-9', 'gallbladder removal', 'malakoplakia', 'surgical case report']",,Cureus,HIV

It is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 10 %–30 % if not treated [ AMR has become a significant global health concern, particularly with the growing resistance in  The present study aims to elucidate the molecular complexity of fluoroquinolone resistance, which is a first-line treatment for typhoid infection. Fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin, are widely used antibiotics for treating typhoid. However, frequent use of fluoroquinolones leads to resistance, triggered by various genetic factors. These factors include mutations in the target genes responsible for DNA replication and repair, namely gyrase ( This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Biosciences, Mohammad Ali Jinnah University.

However, to conclusively demonstrate this mechanism, further studies involving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or experimental structural biology approaches, such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, are necessary. These methods could provide a more detailed understanding of the conformational changes induced by the mutations and their impact on drug binding.

11470418,Lifestyle score is associated with cellular immune profiles in healthy Tanzanian adults,"Immune system and vaccine responses vary across geographical locations worldwide, not only between high and low-middle income countries (LMICs), but also between rural and urban populations within the same country. Lifestyle factors such as housing conditions, exposure to microorganisms and parasites and diet are associated with rural-and urban-living. However, the relationships between these lifestyle factors and immune profiles have not been mapped in detail. Here, we profiled the immune system of 100 healthy Tanzanians living across four rural/urban areas using mass cytometry. We developed a lifestyle score based on an individual's household assets, housing condition and recent dietary history and studied the association with cellular immune profiles. Seventeen out of 80 immune cell clusters were associated with living location or lifestyle score, with eight identifiable only using lifestyle score. Individuals with low lifestyle score, most of whom live in rural settings, showed higher frequencies of NK cells, plasmablasts, atypical memory B cells, T helper 2 cells, regulatory T cells and activated CD4","Variation in the immune system have been observed across populations in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa and Asia and those living in high-income countries (HICs) in Europe and the USA ( Several factors determine the immune profile of an individual, including genetic and demographic factors, such as age and sex, as well as environmental factors, including exposure to microorganisms and parasites, type of housing and dietary history ( Socioeconomic status (SES) is intertwined with housing quality, nutritional status and access to healthcare ( Although the immune profiles of urban- and rural-living individuals have been directly compared, a more granular assessment of lifestyles irrespective of living location is lacking, as individuals living in rural areas may exhibit an urban lifestyle and  Therefore, we not only used mass cytometry to obtain a highly granular immune profile but also surveyed lifestyle variation among Tanzanian adults recruited from two rural and two urban locations to maximize lifestyle variation using a detailed questionnaire of housing conditions, assets and recent dietary history. We present a lifestyle score based on these questionnaire data, which places individuals on the spectrum ranging from rural to urban lifestyle. We used this lifestyle score to explain immune profile variation in Tanzanian adults living in rural and urban areas and contrasted this with immune signatures from urban-living Europeans. In addition, we utilized a machine learning model to define combined immune signatures most strongly associated with the lifestyle score. The Tanzanian study population consisted of 203 adults recruited from four geographical locations in northern Tanzania, including two urban locations, Arusha and Moshi Urban and two rural locations, Moshi Rural and Mwanga ( From these 203 individuals ( Baseline characteristics of the study population ( To characterize the cellular immune profiles between rural- and urban-living individuals, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stained with a panel of 37 metal-tagged antibodies. The processed single-cell level dataset contained 69.6 million live CD45 The CD4 Within the CD8 Within living locations, considerable variation in immune signatures was observed. Therefore, to better capture immune variation across locations, we developed a lifestyle score, which incorporates detailed questionnaire data on assets (e.g. possession of a watch, television or car), housing (i.e. materials used to construct the house) and food history (i.e. frequency of consumption of dietary products) into a single score. To obtain the lifestyle score, we applied Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), a dimensionality reduction method similar to Principle Component Analysis (PCA), but for categorical data, which was applied to 38 questions (118 variable categories) collected from all 203 participants ( Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) based on questionnaire data to generate lifestyle score. A) MCA was applied to categorical questionnaire data (38 manually curated questions; 21 on assets, 11 on food and 6 on housing) ( We found that the lifestyle score (PC1) was significantly associated with thirteen of 80 cell clusters, while none of the other principal components (PC2-PC5) showed any statistically significant associations with cell cluster frequencies ( Next, we explored the most strongly contributing lifestyle score variables across questionnaire categories, including housing conditions, assets and food history. Overall, assets showed the highest cumulative contribution to the lifestyle score (53.6%), followed by housing (30.3%) and food variables (16.1%) ( Besides lifestyle score (PC1), we found that PC2 explained 4.1% of the variance ( We next assessed the association between lifestyle score and immune cell frequencies using GLMMs, adjusting for age and sex. We first verified that lifestyle score in individuals with matching mass cytometry data ( Overall, 13 cell clusters were associated with lifestyle score, of which 8 clusters were not identified by previous analyses where we assessed differences in immune profile between locations ( In contrast, within the CD8 To investigate if a combination of immune cell clusters could be identified that together is associated with a lifestyle score (‘immune endotype’), a machine learning model (elastic net) was trained with lifestyle score as an outcome and cell cluster frequencies, age and sex as the predictor variables. Model training and hyperparameter tuning were performed on 80% of the data ( Taken together the elastic net model unveiled a fairly stable ( Here, we assessed the associations between location and/or lifestyle score and cellular immune profiles measured by mass cytometry. We found that seventeen of 80 clusters were associated with location or lifestyle score, with eight identifiable only when using lifestyle score, illustrating the ability of lifestyle score to capture immune variation. Indeed, individuals living in rural areas may exhibit an urban lifestyle and  We found an association between low lifestyle score and expression of activation markers such as CD38, HLA-DR and CTLA-4 on CD4 In contrast to these previous studies, none of our participants tested positive for malaria and the prevalence of current helminth infections was very low. Therefore, we speculate that increased activation of CD4 Alternatively, housing conditions related to a low lifestyle score (e.g. sand or earth floors and mud-wall houses) may predispose to different commensals or exposure to bacteria and fungi and their metabolites ( We found that individuals with low lifestyle score most of whom live in rural settings, display a higher frequency of plasmablasts. Plasmablasts are differentiated B cells with a short lifespan, which initiate early antibody responses during infections ( Last, we identified an association between both naïve CD8 The strengths of this study include the use of mass cytometry data in combination with the availability of detailed information on housing, assets and food history. Condensing this information into a single score allowed us to train a machine learning model to identify a distinct group of cell clusters (termed ‘immune endotype’), which was strongly associated with lifestyle score variation. Previous studies in HICs indicated that baseline (gene-expression-based) immune endotypes exhibiting a strong pro-inflammatory profile are predictive of improved vaccine responses in young adults across multiple vaccines ( In conclusion, in this study we comprehensively assessed the association between immune profiles and location and lifestyle variables in a LMIC. Additional cell clusters were detected through a more refined measurement of lifestyle. Follow-up studies should therefore focus on the links between lifestyle score, immune signature and functional immune responses, particularly in populations where vaccine responses are expected to be reduced and in populations with the highest prevalence of diseases linked to exaggerated immune responses to allergens and autoantigens. This observational study was conducted between September and October 2022 as part of the CapTan study. A total of 203 healthy Tanzanian participants aged between 18 and 35 years were included from two urban locations (Urban Arusha and Urban Moshi) and two rural locations (Rural Moshi and Mwanga) in northern Tanzania ( The study was approved both at a local level by the Ethical Board of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College (No. 2588) and at the national level by the Tanzania National Ethical Committee Board (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/4089). In addition, samples collected from ten Dutch 18 to 30-year-old adults enrolled between January 2022 and September 2022 were included in the TINO study ( Arusha City (1400m above sea level; 617,631 inhabitants ( Kilimanjaro region has about 1.9 million inhabitants ( People in Rural Moshi (535,803 inhabitants ( The population of Mwanga district (684m above sea level; 148,763 inhabitants ( Europeans were recruited in the area around Leiden, an urban centre in The Netherlands. European individuals were Dutch. In rural communities, study information was given through community leaders and announcements during mass gatherings in mosques, churches and during village meetings. In urban communities, study information was distributed using leaflets and through community leaders, office announcements and university gatherings. Eligible participants (age 18–35 years and permanent residency of a given location) were asked to enroll in the study. Following informed consent, 230 participants were voluntarily screened for in- and exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, lactation, having acute or chronic diseases, being HIV-positive, recent use of antibiotics, use of antimalarials and use of tuberculostatic drugs.

Data from Tanzanian individuals were collected using the cloud-based electronic data collection system REDCap, with a server hosted at the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute in Tanzania. Data from Dutch participants were collected in a Castor database, with a server hosted in The Netherlands. Questionnaires adopted from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (TDHS-MIS) and previously published work conducted in Tanzania, focused on diet in relation to metabolic profiles and inflammatory status ( Blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes from 189 of 203 participants. PBMC isolation and cryopreservation were performed as previously described ( Antibody panels were designed to phenotype immune cells  On the day of staining, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed with 20% FCS/2 mM Mg2+/1:10,000 benzonase/RPMI medium at 37 °C and washed twice with 10% FCS/RPMI medium.

Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring phytochemicals in  A total of 27 phytochemicals were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against AChE, BACE1, and TACE with YASARA Structure. ADMET profiles and toxicity were assessed. The top candidate compounds underwent 100 ns MD simulations. All ligands met Lipinski's rule and showed low toxicity. Catechins, compared with the known drug galantamine, showed higher inhibitory activity and interacted with additional active sites on AChE, thus suggesting potentially higher efficacy. Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed stronger inhibitory activity against TACE than the control drug (aryl-sulfonamide), thereby suggesting a different mechanism of action. MD simulation revealed that the formed complexes had good stability. However, further exploration is necessary.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease posing substantial global health challenges involving cognitive decline and memory impairment. AD accounts for 60%–80% of all neurodegenerative cases.

The YASARA Structure docking procedure was initiated through the script “dock_runscreening.mcr,” by using the VINA docking engine. Each docking simulation was repeated 100 times with the AMBER 14 forcefield, and the simulation cell was filled with water set to a density of 0.997 g/L. Subsequently, Gasteiger charges were assigned to model the electrostatic interactions of the molecules. AChE (PDB ID:  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to investigate the protein–ligand complexes' dynamic behavior and stability for the top-scoring ligands identified for each of the three target enzymes (AChE, BACE1, and TACE). This powerful drug discovery method considers the inherent flexibility of proteins, thus providing a more realistic representation of binding than static docking methods. YASARA Structure (Bioinformatics 30, 2981-2982 version 19.9.17) was used for simulation with the AMBER14 force field. The simulation was conducted under physiological conditions with a constant temperature of 310 K, pH 7.4, and 0.9% NaCl solution. Gasteiger charges were then assigned to model the electrostatic interactions of the molecules. In addition, the simulation cell was solvated with water set to a 0.997 g/L density and extended by 20 Å in each direction to account for solvation effects ( Visualization of the state of the molecular dynamics simulation of A) Catechin-AChE. B) Chlorogenic acid-BACE1. C) Chlorogenic acid-TACE. The generated simulation trajectories were analyzed to assess the stability of the protein–ligand complexes. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and radius of gyration (Rg) were calculated with the md_analyze.mcr macro. First, drug-likeness and safety profiles were assessed for 27 candidate phytochemicals. Some phytochemicals violated Lipinski's rule of five, namely logP >3.

MD simulation was performed to compute the stability of ligand–enzyme complexes. Several parameters were used, including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and binding free energy calculation with MM-PBSA. The dynamic behavior and stability of six complexes were determined according to RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and MM-PBSA. In addition, MD simulation was performed in YASARA Structure software with a 100 ns trajectory, and the all-atom force fields AMBER14 and SASA for the complexes. SASA analysis indicated the stability of the control drugs and the chlorogenic acid-BACE1 complex in 100 ns MD simulations. The complexes showed minimal fluctuations in SASA values, thus suggesting minimal changes in the solvent exposure of the protein surface after ligand binding ( SASA as a function of simulation time, depicted for the ligand–enzyme complexes after 100 ns MD simulations. The plot includes complexes of catechin-AChE (black), galantamine-AChE (red), chlorogenic acid-TACE (purple), aryl-sulfonamide-TACE (green), chlorogenic acid-BACE1 (yellow), and 2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one-BACE1 (blue).

RMSF profiles showed similar stability in the 100 ns MD simulations for all complexes, in line with the results from RMSF analysis ( RMSF plot of catechin-AChE (black), galantamine-AChE (red), chlorogenic acid-TACE (purple), aryl-sulfonamide-TACE (green), chlorogenic acid-BACE1 (yellow), and 2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one-BACE1 (blue). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregation of amyloid plaques and protein tangles in the brain. In this context, BACE1 inhibition may provide a strategy to decrease the production of amyloid-β peptides, a major component of the amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brains of affected individuals. Docking simulation revealed that chlorogenic acid formed favorable interactions in the BACE1 binding pocket. Therefore, by inhibiting BACE1 activity, these compounds might potentially slow the formation and progression of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The identified phytochemicals were evaluated according to Lipinski's rule of five to assess drug-likeness properties. This widely used rule predicts compounds' absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles according to their physicochemical properties. Specifically, Lipinski's rule suggests that compounds with a molecular weight less than 500 Da, a logP value below 5, no more than ten hydrogen bond acceptors, no more than five hydrogen bond donors, and fewer than ten rotatable bonds show favorable drug-like characteristics. These parameters influence compounds' ability to be absorbed, to be distributed in the body, to be metabolized and excreted, and to potentially cause toxicity (collectively known as the ADMET profile). According to Lipinski's rule, favorable properties suggest a high likelihood of a compound's successful navigation of these processes in the body. The phytochemicals inconsistent with the rule violated only logP >3, thus potentially indicating poor solubility and bioavailability, and negatively affecting their efficacy and safety as drugs. After  The docking results for AChE and BACE1 showed favorable binding affinities for catechin and chlorogenic acid. However, the binding affinity values were not significantly lower than those of the established drugs galantamine-AChE and aryl-sulfonamide-BACE1 ( Our results indicated the potential of  The number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions significantly affects the strength and stability of ligand-receptor binding. Non-covalent and hydrophobic interactions significantly influence the strength and stability of ligand-receptor binding. In addition, 2D visualization identifies two types of hydrogen bonds, conventional and carbon-hydrogen bonds, whereas hydrophobic interactions include pi and alkyl. MD simulation of the binding pockets of AChE, BACE1, and TACE was conducted to provide insights for drug discovery. In addition, AMBER14 was used as the computational tool for simulation. The force field included a comprehensive set of parameters delineating atom interactions in a molecule, comprising bond stretching, angle bending, and non-bonded interactions. AMBER14 offers a suite of functionalities, such as input file preparation, simulation execution, analysis of results, and visualization of molecular structures and interactions. This software facilitates the exploration of biomolecule dynamics and properties under diverse conditions and environments in biochemistry and drug discovery. The SASA graph indicated the compactness of the target protein after interaction with an inhibitor, primarily through hydrophobic interactions. During the 100 ns and 5 ns simulations, all complexes showed stable RMSD movement ( Rg is a fundamental metric for characterizing the sizes of chain molecules and a key indicator of protein compactness and flexibility in biological contexts. In this study, this variable enabled the comparison of the protein structures relative to the hydrodynamic radius, an experimentally observable parameter. According to Ghahremanian et al., insights derived from measurements can substantially contribute to understanding of the dynamic interplay between proteins and their surrounding environment. YASARA's built-in macros were used to conduct calculations, where positive energy indicated stronger binding. In addition, stronger binding and compact interactions were indicated by higher binding energy values in MM-PBSA calculations. MD simulation provides insights into the stability of ligand–protein complexes and consequently the pharmacodynamics of the compounds. A highly stable complex, indicated by low RMSD fluctuations and minimal structural changes (Rg), suggests tight binding to the enzyme's active site. Although potent enzyme inhibition might result, other effects might include prolonged drug action or difficulty in drug clearance by the body, thus potentially causing adverse effects. In contrast, high RMSD fluctuations or Rg values in the simulation might signify readily dissociated ligands, thus potentially translating to a short duration of action for the drug and a need for frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects. Chlorogenic acid is a widespread phenolic compound in plants including coffee, fruits, vegetables, and traditional Chinese herbal medicines. This study explored the potential of chlorogenic acid to serve as an anti-AD agent, according to its ability to interact with three key enzymes associated with AD: AChE, BACE1, and TACE. Beyond its potential role in AD treatment, chlorogenic acid exhibits a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antioxidant, hepatoprotective (liver protection), nephroprotective (kidney protection), antibacterial, antitumor, metabolic regulatory (sugar and lipid metabolism), anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. This study described a screening method to explore potential treatments for patients with AD. According to Poon et al. This  This study has several limitations.

11470278,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Patient Referral among Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors in Obio-Akpor, Rivers State","With the limited number of trained health care providers in Nigeria, PPMVs are inevitable, especially in rural areas for the supply of drugs, and integration through appropriate referral practices is quintessential. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral among PPMVs in a setting with limited hospital infrastructure. This cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted in Obio-Akpor, Rivers State using a structured questionnaire that measured the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted with SPSS version 25 and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Most of the respondents reported moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice (62.4%, 73.4%, and 58% respectively) of patient referral. Multivariate analysis showed statistically significant inverse relationships between years of experience and odds of their knowledge, attitude, and practice of referral. PPMVs with 3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate knowledge (AOR = 178.96; 95%CI: 60.15 - 532.49; p-value <0.005), attitude (AOR = 7.38;95%CI: (3.78 - 14.40; P-value <0.005) and practice (AOR = 131.56; 95%CI: 53.50 - 323.51; p-value <0.005) than those with above 10 years of experience after controlling for the effects of other variables. The most frequently reported barrier to referral was fear of losing clients while most referrals were for laboratory investigations. Most PPMVs reported moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral. PPMVs were aware of the benefits of referrals but concerned about losing their clients to formal healthcare facilities.","Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is at the core of current global healthcare delivery debates and agendas Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) play vital roles in the provision of health services especially for underserved populations in low- and middle-income countries6 but there are indications of poor linkage with formal health services. PPMVs are operators of drug retail outlets selling over the counter (OTC) medicines as well as prescription drugs but do not have formal training as pharmacists Based on their accessibility, affordability, and convenience, PPMVs play a critical role in providing access to care for common health issues. Thus, serving as critical allies in extending healthcare access to hard-to-reach and underserved population groups, especially in countries in transition A referral is a process in which a health care provider at a lower level of the health service seeks assistance or requests a takeover of the management of a medical case by a more equipped and/or specially trained person with better resources operating at a higher level As a result of their dominance across the community, well-trained and regulated PPMVs could support Nigeria’s accelerated journey toward attaining UHC. The task-shifting policies Nigeria implemented in 2014/2015 place higher demands on PPMVs to serve as community-oriented resource persons (CORPs), assisting in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and maternity and child health PPMV’s operations within the community require regulation and supportive supervision to ensure the delivery of equitable quality and safe care in their rapidly expanding roles under a task-shifting regime. Adequate linkage to the formal healthcare providers through the process of referral is a sine qua non in ensuring that patients receive comprehensive, safe, and prompt care. Limited studies on patient referral practices among PPMVs are in relation to specific populations/disease conditions (children under 5 years, malaria testing and treatment, oral contraceptive pill use) This descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in Obio-Akpor LGA of Rivers State was used to measure the participants’ knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral, as well as possible associations of their characteristics with the patient referral. This study was conducted in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area (LGA) of Rivers State. Obio-Akpor LGA covers 260 km17with a 2006 Census population of 464,789  The Obio-Akpor branch of the National Association of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (NAPPMED) is divided into two administrative units that independently report to the National Association. All PPMVs registered with the Rivers State branch of NAPPMED in Obio/Akpor LGA (Units 1 and 2) made up the research population. Although found in all areas of the LGA, the PPMVs are more concentrated in and around interior settlements and close to the marketplaces. All PPMVs registered with their association (NAPPMED) in both units of Obio-Akpor LGA were included in the study if they consented. The sample size was determined using Cochran’s formula for descriptive cross-sectional surveys we used the formula for descriptive studies (19) Sample size (n) =  Z_(1 —  A stratified random sampling technique was deployed to ensure that each administrative unit in the LGA was adequately represented. The LGA has two administrative units, and simple random sampling was used to select an equal number of PPMVs from each stratum of the LGA. The list of registered PPMVs in the administrative areas under the LGA was used as the sampling frame. The total sample size of 346 questionnaires was divided equally into the two administrative areas with each allocated a sample of 173. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the researchers following a review of the literature. It had two sections; Section A captured the independent variables while Section B had the dependent variables. The independent variables included demographic data (age, sex, marital status, degree of education, occupation), prior patient referral training, and exposure to health education, whereas the dependent variables were knowledge, attitude, practice levels, facilitators, and barriers to patient referral. All the questions were close-ended, and respondents were expected to select just one answer per question. By first employing a pre-tested questionnaire, measurement bias was reduced. Scale internal consistency reliability was measured by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and estimates >0.7 were considered acceptable. The Cronbach’s alpha for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 0.8, 0.85, and 0.87 respectively. To enhance comprehensibility and minimize errors in data collection, the questionnaire was created to be straightforward, concise, and properly formatted. An interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Patent medicine vendor demographics, knowledge of patient referral, attitude, self-reported patient referral behaviors, facilitators, and barriers to referral were collected. The questionnaires were reviewed for random and systematic errors and corrections made. Questionnaires were manually sorted out, data cleaned and then coded before entry into the computer. IBM SPSS software, version 25 for Windows, was used to analyze the data. Each question was scored on a 5-point response scale which was transformed into percentages, items measuring each of the main constructs that represent the dependent variables were summated and thresholds were determined for adequate score (>75%), moderate (50-75%) and poor score (< 50%). Results from descriptive analysis were presented in frequency tables while inferential analysis and bivariate and multivariate ordinal logistics regressions were conducted to examine factors associated with the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of referrals among PPMVs. Ordinal logistics functions of the generalized linear model with a multinomial probability distribution and cumulative logic-linked functions were carried out. This was done using SPSS because the dependent variable was ordinal, and the independent variables were categorical. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Port Harcourt (Ref: UPH/R&D/REC/EXEC/049 dated 12 This section presents the results of knowledge, attitude, and patient referral practices of patent and proprietary medicine vendors in Obio-Akpor LGA of Rivers State. Socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents Knowledge of client referral of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State is presented above, it indicates that 18.3% had adequate knowledge, 62.4% had moderate knowledge and 19.2% had poor knowledge. The attitude of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State towards client referral presented above, shows that 13% had an adequate attitude, 73.4% had a moderate attitude and 13.6% had a poor attitude. While the practice of client referral by the patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor, Rivers State is shown in the pie chart in  Knowledge, attitude, and practice score of the respondents Relationship between PPMV background characteristics and level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral From the data presented in the table, the odds of having adequate knowledge were slightly lower among males compared to females in both the bivariate (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.64 - 1.50) and multivariate models (OR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.59 - 1.52). These findings were, however, not statistically significant. There were statistically significant inverse relationships between years of experience and odds of having adequate knowledge as PPMV with 3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate knowledge (AOR = 178.96; 95%CI: 60.15 - 532.49; p-value <0.005) than those with more than 10 years of experience after controlling for the effects of other variables. Similarly, those with 4 - 10 years of experience reported significantly greater odds (AOR = 20.50; 95%CI: 7.75 - 54.25; p<0.001) compared to those with more than 10 years of experience For attitude, bivariate analysis showed that individuals aged 20-29 have an odds ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.06-0.28) compared to individuals aged 50 and above, indicating a significantly decreased likelihood of adequate patient referral attitude. Similarly, in the multivariate analysis, individuals aged 20-29 still have a significantly decreased likelihood of patient referral after adjusting for other variables, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.44-0.22), and a p-value of <0.005. For the bivariate analysis of attitude scores, the odds ratio (OR) for being male versus female is 1.08, but it is not statistically significant (p = 0.713). After adjusting for other variables in the multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) remains non-significant at 1.23 (p = 0.434). This suggests that gender does not significantly influence practice once other factors are considered. There is however a significant association between age categories and adequate referral practice. Individuals aged 30-39 and 40-49 have decreased odds ratio; 0.34 (0.16 - 0.73) and 0.27 (0.13 - 0.60) respectively of adequate referral practice compared to those aged 50 and above. However, in the multivariate analysis, these associations lose significance (AOR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.45 - 1.68; p-value >0.005 and AOR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.26 - 1.06; p-value >0.005) after adjusting for other variables. This indicates that age may not independently predict the outcome once other factors are considered. Both in the bivariate and multivariate analyses, individuals with more years of experience in the trade have significantly higher odds of adequate referral practice compared to those with fewer years of experience. PPMVs with <3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate referral practice (AOR = 131.56; 95%CI: 53.50 - 323.51; p-value <0.005) than those with more than 10 years of experience after adjusting for other variables. Similarly, those with 4 - 10 years of experience reported significantly greater odds (AOR = 8.89; 95%CI: 4.07 - 19.41; p<0.001) compared to those with more than 10 years of experience in the trade. Barriers and facilitators to patient referral among PPMVs in Obio/Akpor, Rivers state (n=338). Common facilities patients were referred The study which assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and patient referral practices of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor, Rivers State, found that a high proportion of respondents had moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice (62.4%, 73.4% and 58% respectively) of patient referral and it was significantly associated with their age and experience in the trade. It also highlighted some factors that functioned as facilitators and barriers to patient referrals among these PPMVs. The findings shed light on distinct PPMV responsibilities in healthcare as well as the variables affecting their referral habits. The facilitators identified in this study include the severity of the client's condition, the need for diagnostic tests, and the accessibility of alternative treatments. Barriers to referrals included insufficient training, limited access to healthcare facilities, poor communication, clients' financial constraints, and the fear of losing customers. Addressing these barriers and promoting education and training can enhance the effectiveness of patient referrals and contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. The findings of the study show that for knowledge, most of the respondents had adequate and poor knowledge of referral practice, while the majority had moderate knowledge of client referral. This shows that PPMVs in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State know proper client referrals when faced with health conditions beyond their expertise. This level of habit and knowledge application is in line with the assertion of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health The Level of Knowledge of respondents in this research can be said to be a major influence on the knowledge of referral of patients as is presented in the socio-demographic table where (20.4%) of the respondents had tertiary, or another form of education. While most of the respondents have long years of experience, 28.7% had 4-10 years of experience and 41.1% had more than 10 years of experience with patent and proprietary medicine. This is in line with the results of a study conducted in Rivers State in 2012 In assessing the respondents’ attitudes, the study revealed that most PPMVs had a moderate attitude towards client referral. However, 13% of the PPMVs displayed an adequate attitude while 13.6% demonstrated a poor attitude. Nevertheless, this is still considered a positive attitude overall. The variance in referral attitude amongst participants in this research could be attributed to the level of education and level of training provided for the patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs). This can be seen in the interventional research findings conducted in 2023 Some factors influence patient referral by the PPMVs, these include the severity of the client’s condition at the time of presentation; although low in percentage, it is in line with the assertion of a previous study The findings of this research show that some of the difficulties experienced by the PPMVs towards patient referrals were a result of inadequate training, which is consistent with the findings of a 2013 research conducted in South Eastern Nigeria Client's inability to pay the cost of care at health facilities also posed a barrier to patient referral, more than one-third of low-income individuals are underinsured (defined as spending more than 5% of family income on medical care), and 8% and 13% avoid or delay seeking medical treatment or prescription drugs, respectively in a previous study The exclusion of unlicensed PPMVs from the study was one of its limitations which could affect the generalization of these findings to all PPMVs in the locality as unregistered and unauthorized PPMVs might operate differently from licensed ones. A further constraint was the deployment of self-report measures, which have been shown to generate information bias. As with other cross-sectional studies, the goal of this study was to provide insights into issues that would help guide future research and interventions. However, because establishing temporality in this kind of study design presents challenges, the connections found in this study cannot be made to be causal. A better understanding of the knowledge, attitude, and patient referral practices of PPMVs can result in better health outcomes for patients through increased health education, better preventive care, lower healthcare costs, and more equitable access to health care. Improving patient outcomes in the community can be facilitated by fixing the identified flaws in the referral process involving the PPMVs. This study identifies the need for collaboration and integration - encouraging collaboration between PPMVs and the formal healthcare system to improve referral pathways and access to equitable and comprehensive healthcare services. Healthcare services may become more efficient and well-coordinated if these cooperative efforts are strengthened. The findings of this research can help build healthcare quality assurance protocols for patent medicine vendors. This could entail creating policies, curriculums, or certification procedures to make sure suppliers follow recommended procedures for patient referrals. Enhancing PPMVs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) in patient referral necessitates training and certification programs. Comprehensive training is essential because it improves clinical skills and keeps PPMVs up to date with medical guidelines. On the other hand, case studies and hands-on workshops would emphasize the value of making timely referrals. By offering a certification process, one could promote positive patient relations and confidence by establishing professional standards and ethical care. All of this would contribute to the development of standardized referral procedures and efficient provider-to-provider communication, guaranteeing reliable and smooth patient treatment. Potential risks in the healthcare system can be identified by understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and referral practices of patent medicine vendors. Reducing these risks can help build a stronger and more dependable healthcare delivery system. PPMVs had moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral even with high awareness of how referrals affected their clients' overall treatment outcomes. Constraints to referral practices at PPMVs include poor follow-up, the cost of accessing care at formal healthcare facilities, and the fear of losing customers. These require urgent interventions involving behavior change communication (BCC) and educational interventions for PPMVs. Regulatory agencies need to step-up monitoring, supervision, and capacity-building operations for PPMVs.","['Attitude', 'Barriers', 'Facilitators', 'Knowledge', 'Patent Medicine Vendor', 'Practice, Referral']",,Nigerian Medical Journal : Journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,HIV

For Nigeria to achieve epidemic control, pregnant women need to know their HIV status through HIV testing, which is the gateway to HIV prevention, care, support, and treatment services. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of HIV testing among Nigerian pregnant women aged 15-49 years HIV testing during antenatal visits or childbirth. Secondary data analyses of 659 pregnant women randomly selected from the multiple imputation datasets of the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)were done using SPSS version 25. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, HIV stigmatizing attitudes, and HIV testing were retrieved from the dataset for the study. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were done to determine the predictors of HIV testing. The prevalence of self-reported HIV testing and receiving results among women of reproductive age was 36.72%. Bivariate model findings showed that educational level, place of residence, and religion were statistically significant predictors of HIV testing among pregnant women. Only educational level and place of residence significantly predicted pregnant women's HIV testing in the parsimonious multivariable regression model. Pregnant women with higher levels of education (Primary Education, AOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.07,3.19; Secondary Education, AOR, 3.75; 95% CI:1.93, 7.28; Higher Education, AOR, 11.23; 95% CI: 4.40, 28.68) and those living in urban areas (AOR, 1.60: 95% CI:1.03, 2.47) were more likely to test for HIV than those with no education and those living in the rural areas. This study identified having a higher level of education and living in urban areas as predictors of HIV testing, therefore, more efforts are needed to have women with lower levels of education and those living in rural areas test for HIV as a strategy for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.","According to The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), globally,37.7 million people were HIV-positive at the end of 2020. Nigeria is ranked fourth globally regarding the burden of HIV, with an estimated 1.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2020. HIV testing is a leading strategy and the route to prevention, treatment, care, and support services for HIV/AIDS. HIV testing services serve as the gateway to prevention, care, support, and treatment services. We requested permission to use the dataset, which was granted for me to download the data for the study from  This study was a secondary analysis of the 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data of pregnant women aged 15-49 years. The 2013 NDHS was a cross-sectional nationally representative study that used a three-stage stratified cluster design to select the study participants in Nigeria and collect data on the variables of interest using pretested questionnaires. Stigmatizing attitudes of the pregnant women were coded by combining the following seven questions: (1) ""Would you buy fresh vegetables from a vendor who has the AIDS virus?"" (2) ""If a member of your family got infected with the virus that causes AIDS, would you want it to remain a secret or not?"" (3) ""If a relative of yours became sick with the virus that causes AIDS, would you be willing to care for her or him in your own household?"" (4) ""If a female teacher has the AIDS virus, should she be allowed to continue teaching in school?"" And (5) ""Should children aged 12-14 be taught about using a condom to avoid AIDS?"" (6) ""People with the AIDS virus should be ashamed of themselves"" (7) People with the AIDS virus should be blamed for bringing the disease into the community. Stigmatizing attitudes were graded as positive or negative. For the stigmatizing attitudes questions, a score of one (1) was assigned to a positive answer (non-stigmatizing response) and zero (0) for a negative answer (stigmatizing response). A positive answer can be Yes or No to the questions depending on whether the answer is stigmatizing or not and was scored as 1 while a negative answer can also be Yes or No and was scored 0. The scores were summed up to obtain an overall score for each respondent. Respondents scoring less than the mean score for attitudes were classified as having negative attitudes = 0, while those scoring equal or above the mean score were classified as having positive attitudes = 1. The participant’s mean score of .56 (56%) ± was taken as the cut-point. Age categories were categorized into age bands of five-year intervals from 15 to 49 years and numbered in ascending order. Education; No education = 0, primary = 1, secondary = 2, higher = 3. Education was recorded as No education = 0, primary = 1, secondary = 2, higher. Place of Residence was coded as Urban = 1and Rural = 2. Religion was coded as Catholic = 1, Other Christians = 2, Islam = 3, Traditionalist = 4, Others 97. Marital status categories were recoded as Currently Married (combining married and living with a partner as if married options) = 1, Not currently Married (combining other options) = 0. A combination of four questions was used to create the dependent variable from the responses of the pregnant women who participated in the 2013 NDHS as follows: 1. Did you test for HIV as part of antenatal visits? 2. Did you test for HIV between the time you went for delivery and before the baby was born? 3. Did you get the results of the HIV test as part of antenatal visits? 4. Did you get the results of your HIV test before the baby was born? The binary dependent variable ""Self-reported HIV testing by pregnant women aged 15-49 years was coded as; No=0 if the respondent did not test, tested but did not receive the result, and Yes= if the respondent tested and received a result during antenatal visits or childbirth. The pregnant women sample was created from the sample of women of reproductive age by combining three questions: Total child ever born + currently pregnant +ever had a terminated pregnancy. Ever giving birth and a yes answer to currently pregnant and ever had a terminated pregnancy was coded as pregnant woman = 1, while ever not giving birth and not currently pregnant or never had a terminated pregnancy was coded as Not pregnant = 0. Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 was used for the study analysis. The coding’s of the study's variables are shown in  Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Respondents Out of the 659 pregnant women who self-reported either did not test, tested, and did not receive results or tested and received HIV results during antenatal or childbirth, 417 (63.28%) of them did not test or tested and did not receive results, while 242 (36.72%) of them tested and received HIV test. The participants' demographic characteristics are presented below in Table 1. The ages of the pregnant women ranged from 15-49 years and were categorized into seven 5-year groups. Women within 25-29 years had the highest number in the sample,139 (21.09%), while those within 15-19 years had the lowest number in the sample, 38 (5.77%). Pregnant women with no education ranked highest in the sample, 296 (44.92%), while those with higher education were the lowest number, 50 (7.59%). More women lived in rural areas, 412 (62.52%) than in urban areas, 247 (37.48 %). Most pregnant women belong to the Islamic religion, 367 (55.69%), followed by other Christians, 219 (33.29%). Pregnant women who are currently married (i.e., married or living with a man as if they are married) were 394(90.14%) of the sample, while those who are not currently married (Never in a union, widowed, divorced, and no longer living together/separated) were65(9.86%). Women with positive attitudes towards persons living with HIV/AIDS were 402(61.00%), while those with negative attitudes were 257 (39.00%). Result of the Bivariate and Multivariable Regression Analysis of the Predictors' Association with Self-reported HIV Testing of Pregnant Women This study determined the predictors of HIV testing among pregnant women aged15-49 years in Nigeria. Knowledge of HIV status among pregnant women through HIV testing is an essential strategy for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It is also important for the reduction of HIV transmission among the general population. This study showed no significant association of age with HIV testing during antenatal visits or childbirth among pregnant women aged 15 - 49. Being older has been reported in other studies to be a predictor of uptake of HIV testing, Women with a higher level of education are more likely to test for HIV than those with no education in this study (AOR, 8.09; 95% CI: 2.97, 22.06). Ajayi et al., Ejigu and Tadesse, and Muyunda et al. corroborated this finding in their reports. Pregnant women dwelling in urban areas were 1.66 times more likely to test for HIV than those dwelling in rural areas in this study (AOR, 1.66; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.53). This finding is consistent with what was reported in similar studies Pregnant women of the Catholic and other Christian religions were statistically significantly more likely to test for HIV than those of the Islamic religion in the bivariate model, although the multivariable model did not corroborate it. Other studies have reported that religion significantly predicted HIV testing of pregnant women. This study found no significant association between self-reported HIV testing of pregnant women who are currently and not currently married. Although Muhinda and Pazvakawambwa and Muyunda et al. corroborated this finding that marital status was not significantly associated with the likelihood of testing for HIV, other studies reported that being currently married was significantly associated with testing for HIV. In this study, pregnant women with positive attitudes were not significantly more likely to test for HIV than those with negative attitudes during antenatal visits or childbirth (OR, 1.47; 95% CI: .57, 3.76). Meremo et al. and Ha et al. reported similar findings in their studies. A limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design of the NDHS study, which made it unattainable to establish causality between the predictors and the dependent variable of HIV testing. Also, data were collected in the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey through self-reports of the respondents, and therefore, recall bias of the respondents may have impacted this study's findings. Another limitation is the use of a mean cut-off score to categorize those with and without stigmatizing attitudes because those whose attitudes are close to the cut-off mean may be incorrectly grouped leading to skewed conclusions about the prevalence of stigmatization. Unmeasured confounding is another potential limitation because the study variables were restricted to the ones collected in the 2013 NDHS. This study found that educational level and place of residence predicted HIV testing of pregnant women aged 15-49 in both the bivariable and multivariable regression models. These identified predictors could be targeted in designing informed policies, strategies, and interventions to control the HIV epidemic among pregnant women aged 15-49 years in Nigeria. Also, more HIV testing centers should be made available and accessible to rural dwellers in Nigeria by the Government.","[' Antenatal Visits', 'HIV Testing', 'Predictors', 'Pregnant Women', 'Nigeria']",,Nigerian Medical Journal : Journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,HIV
11470120,Genetic knock-in of ,Common single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of polymorphic genes that influence disease risk. Nevertheless, there remains a debate on whether disease risk arises primarily from the cumulative impact of numerous common variants with minor effect sizes or from a limited number of rare variants with substantial effect sizes. The complex interplay of common variants and rare mutations is further complicated by intricate gene-gene, gene-environment, and epigenetic interactions that collectively shape the landscape of complex traits and disease susceptibility One emerging example of this complexity is eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 ( A rare variant of  The major and minor alleles of rs867529, rs13045, and rs1805165, form PERK-A and PERK-B, respectively, the two most common haplotypes of PERK, whereas the minor allele of rs13045 alone forms the much rarer PERK-D We hypothesized that the PERK-B SNVs would exhibit increased PERK activity both in vitro and in vivo, particularly under acute ER stress conditions. We anticipated that the subtle changes induced by these SNVs, despite their relatively high frequency and moderate effect size in human studies, would not lead to significant outcomes in physiologic stressors such as aging and that their impact would likely be noticeable in artificial and exogenous acute stress conditions. To this end, we aimed to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction associated with PERK-B SNVs in a novel knock-in mouse line, in which the amino acids of the PERK-B SNVs were introduced into  The conflicting results regarding the effects of PERK-B SNVs on PERK kinase activity PERK-B has higher kinase activity than PERK-A in a cell-free assay.  Previous studies have associated PERK-B SNVs to altered kinase activity and stress response Novel triple knock-in PERK-B/B mice express the three exonic single-nucleotide variants associated with PERK haplotype B.  First, we assessed the potential baseline alterations in PERK levels and downstream signaling partners, particularly focusing on the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 axis Although we found no discernible differences in PERK expression levels and activity across the pancreas, liver, and brain between the PERK-A/A and PERK-B/B mice at baseline, we considered the potential age-related pathologies associated with PERK-B/B SNVs. To this end, we used a comprehensive panel of organ-specific histopathologic analyses in young (2–3 months) and old (13–14 months) cohorts of PERK-A/A, PERK-A/B, and PERK-B/B mice. We found no significant differences in any of the outcomes based on age, sex, or genotype (Fig.  Comparative pathologic analysis of the young and aged cohorts of PERK-A/A, A/B, and B/B mice.  The conflicting data on the impact of PERK-B SNVs on PERK kinase activity reported in in vitro studies ER-stress-induced PERK activity is higher in PERK-B/B-expressing MDMs than in PERK-A/A-expressing MDMs in vitro.  Given that PERK-B/B MDMs displayed higher PERK activity than PERK-A/A MDMs, we investigated three functional consequences of such differential activity: phagocytosis, viability in response to ER stress, and M1 versus M2-like phenotypes. In assessment of the phagocytic function by incubating the MDMs with opsonin-coated Cy3-labeled zymosan beads, we observed that the phagocytotic activity reached saturation at 40 min (Supplementary Fig  Increased PERK activity in PERK-B/B MDMs is not associated with altered function in vitro.  Based on conflicting findings regarding the role of PERK in specific phenotypes of macrophages Disorders associated with  ER stress-induced PERK activity is haplotype-dependent in the liver.  Based on a large body of evidence indicating UPR activation as a contributor of neurodegeneration, we aimed to determine the mechanistic role of PERK-B/B in neurodegeneration. However, we did not detect tunicamycin-induced UPR activation in the CNS (Supplementary Fig  ER stress, particularly PERK activation, is associated with pancreatic atrophy and dysfunction PERK-B/B mice exhibit increased tunicamycin-induced vulnerability in pancreas compared to PERK-A/A mice.  In this study, we use the novel triple knock-in PERK-B/B mouse model to provide insights into the in vivo and in vitro effects of disease risk-associated exonic PERK-B/B SNVs. Our analyses reveal that PERK-B/B is associated with increased PERK kinase activity in the liver and increased susceptibility to apoptosis in the pancreas, particularly under acute ER stress. These observations are further supported by the cell-free PERK kinase assay and data from MDM cultures, which also demonstrate elevated PERK activity in PERK-B/B cells, albeit with minimal functional consequences at acute timepoints. These findings hold significance as they shed light on the conflicting reports regarding the contribution of PERK-B SNVs to its kinase activity, which, in turn, can impact the development of therapeutic strategies for PERK-related disorders Our data add to a growing body of evidence that common variants with small/medium effect size, such as the minor alleles of the exonic PERK-B SNVs First, we demonstrate that the PERK-B/B SNVs elevate PERK activity, both in cell-free conditions and within a cellular milieu. Data from previous in vitro studies elucidating the effects of PERK-B/B SNVs on PERK activity are conflicting. Liu et al We have developed our novel triple knock-in transgenic mouse model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the reported associations of the minor alleles of PERK-B SNVs with pathologies in the periphery and the CNS Our comprehensive histopathologic analyses to further characterize our mouse model and evaluate age-related pathologies revealed no discernible genotype or sex-dependent differences among the PERK-A/A, PERK-A/B, and PERK-B/B mice at 13 months of age. Intriguingly, the only subtle differences were increased acidic alveolar macrophages in PERK-A/B mice, increased lymphoid hyperplasia in PERK-A/A mice, and increased protozoal outgrowth in the colon of PERK-B/B mice. Based on the abundance of PERK haplotype A in about 65% of the global population, with no reports to date linking it to lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen, we believe these changes to be incidental. More definitive answers will require longer observation periods as well as prolonged stressors targeting spleen/lymphocytes to confirm and expound on this finding. Notwithstanding, changes observed in PERK-A/B mice might be an outcome of a mismatch in the active PERK dimer, which is a prerequisite for PERK kinase activity, and warrants further investigation. Notably, these differences were similar between the young and old cohorts. In this context, we leveraged the process of aging as a chronic and mild physiologic stressor, recognizing that aging is the strongest risk factor for various metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings suggest that PERK-B SNVs may not act as independent drivers of aging-related pathologies but rather function as contributors in the presence of additional genetic and/or environmental factors. Indeed, approximately 28% of the global population harbor PERK-B in the absence of experiencing overt disease. The higher risk of late-onset AD reported in individuals with the PERK-B haplotype becomes evident only within the subpopulation of individuals carrying the  Patients with WRS often experience early-onset diabetes, recurrent hepatic dysfunction episodes, and cognitive developmental delay Unexpectedly, we observed decreased stress-induced PERK kinase activity in the pancreas of PERK-B/B mice. Given its increased susceptibility to ER stress We observed higher PERK activity in PERK-B/B MDMs compared to PERK-A/A MDMs only after thapsigargin treatment. Given that the effect was observed at 2 h, it remains unclear whether the difference in PERK activity was transient or might be sustained over longer durations. Our assessments aimed to determine whether the difference in PERK activity between the two genotypes had functional consequences under baseline and stress conditions. Studies on MDM’s in vitro revealed no differences in the kinetics of phagocytosis between the PERK-A/A and PERK-B/B MDMs, despite the observed difference in ER stress-induced kinase activity. Additionally, we evaluated the proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes of MDMs, which are reported to be influenced by PERK Severe and prolonged ER stress leads to cell death. To assess the potential differences in ER stress-induced cell survival associated with PERK haplotypes, we exposed both PERK-A/A and PERK-B/B MDMs to varying doses of thapsigargin, tunicamycin, and the PERK activator CCT020312. All three ER stressors induce UPR through distinct mechanisms. Thapsigargin inhibits the sarco-ER calcium ATPase pump, leading to cellular calcium dyshomeostasis, UPR activation, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death The interpretation of the observed haplotype effects should take PERK abundance into account, given that PERK regulation also includes stabilization and degradation. In experiments where ER stress was induced (Figs.  Critically, the prevalence of PERK-B is dependent on ancestry, with rates varying from 8% in individuals with African ancestry to 32% in those with European ancestry and approximately 50% in those with Asian ancestry Finally, although multiple studies have identified PERK as a potential therapeutic target for disorders affecting both the periphery and the CNS In conclusion, we have developed a novel mouse model to investigate the impact of PERK-B SNVs in pancreas, liver, and brain. Using a combination of cell-free, in vitro, and in vivo models, we illustrate that the SNVs associated with the PERK-B haplotype are associated with higher PERK activity in response to acute ER stress compared to the PERK-A haplotype in some cells and tissues. Importantly, these PERK-B-associated SNVs do not alter PERK expression or its kinase activity at baseline or following chronic mild stress in the form of age in either sex. These SNVs do not affect phagocytosis in MDMs in vitro, although altering the phenotype of following ER stress. These findings align with the observation that these SNVs exert a relatively modest/moderate effect size and exhibit functional consequences in the presence of additional environmental or genetic stressors. In summary, our novel model serves as a powerful tool to investigate the interactions of minor PERK alleles with disease modifiers, permitting improved approaches to leverage this model for therapeutic endpoints.

11470100,Highly sensitive and specific electrochemical biosensor for direct detection of hepatitis C virus RNA in clinical samples using DNA strand displacement,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common blood-borne infection that can lead to long-term illnesses such as hepatocellular cancer and liver cirrhosis. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management, as no vaccine is available for preventing HCV infection. However, the high cost and complexity of current molecular diagnostic tools hinder efforts to achieve early diagnosis and prevent transmission, particularly in resource-limited settings. We developed a novel electrochemical biosensor for point-of-care testing (POCT) of HCV RNA. The sensor utilizes a strand displacement method, where the target RNA displaces a gold nanoparticle-labeled reporter probe (AuRP) from a pre-hybridized duplex with a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-labeled capture probe. The amount of displaced AuRP, detected using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV), is directly proportional to the target RNA concentration. The biosensor exhibited excellent analytical performance, with a detection limit of 4 fM for synthetic targets and 43 ng/µL for RT-PCR products. Importantly, it successfully detected HCV RNA directly in clinical plasma samples without the need for RNA extraction or amplification. The sensor was used to analyze 30 RNA samples from HCV-positive patients, 20 cDNA samples from viral RNA, 30 HCV-positive plasma samples, and 22 HCV-negative plasma samples. The sensor results show good concordance with the RT-PCR results, demonstrating the sensor’s potential for detecting HCV in clinical samples. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-74454-w.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection presents a global public health challenge, affecting approximately 150 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated 58 million people living with chronic HCV infection and approximately 1.5 million new infections occurring annually Acute hepatitis manifests as jaundice in only 20% of patients and is rarely severe. In 85% of infected individuals, the development of chronic infection typically occurs without noticeable symptoms, making it challenging to detect the infection due to its asymptomatic nature and the marginalization of at-risk populations HCV is present in blood and secretions and can be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ transplantation. Thailand, in particular, faces a significant issue with transfusion-transmitted HCV infection, emphasizing the importance of screening blood donors to prevent and minimize the risk of infection The current methods for detecting HCV include an antibody test that detects the presence of antibodies against the HCV in blood samples and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) that detects the viral RNA. HCV RT-PCR tests such as Abbott RealTime HCV Assay, Roche COBAS This study aims to develop a rapid and accurate HCV screening tool based on electrochemical sensor technology that does not require complex or costly equipment. The sensor operates on the principle of strand displacement of a gold nanoparticle labelled reporter probe (AuRP) by the target DNA or RNA in the sample Detection of Hepatitis C virus RNA or synthetic DNA target using the electrochemical sensor platform. (1) First, the Capture probe with magnetic particle (MB-CP) is pre-hybridized to gold nanoparticle-reporter probe (AuNP-RP); (2) The target RNA extracted from the patient sample or synthetic linear DNA target is added to the pre-hybridized strands. Since the target is complementary to the CP, it will displace the AuNP-RP. The displaced AuNP-RP is separated from the MB-CP bound to the target using magnetic separation; (3) The signal of AuNP is detected using an electrochemical technique. The signal is proportional to the concentration of the target. All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water (18.2 ΩM) from Milli-Q The primer and probe sequences were designed based on the genomic sequence of Hepatitis C virus available from GenBank (accession number M62321) Electrochemical measurements were carried out using Palmsens4 computer-controlled potentiostat with PSTrace version 5.8 software obtained from Palmsens, The Netherlands. Nucleic acid concentration was measured using the NanoDrop™ One Microvolume UV-Vis Spectrophotometer obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA. Disposable electrochemical screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) were obtained from Quasense Co. Ltd., Thailand, which consisted of two carbon tracks as working electrodes, reference electrodes, and counter electrodes in DPASV. Preparation of AuNPs-reporter probe conjugate was performed using salt aging method as described by Ngamdee et al The immobilization of biotinylated capture probe (CP) on Dynabeads The pre-displacement duplex strand containing MB-CP and AuRP was prepared by adding 2 µL of MB-CP and 10 µL of AuRP into a tube containing 18 µL of 20 mM PBS/0.1% SDS pH7.4. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 60 °C in a waterbath. Next, washing step aided by magnetic separation was performed using 100 µL of 20 mM PBS/0.05% Tween pH 7.4 for 5 times, followed by 20 mM PBS pH7.4 for 3 times. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet of the pre-displacement duplex strand (MB-CP bound to AuRP) was resuspended with the target sample. The target hybridization was performed using 30 µL of sample, which was added to the pre-displacement duplex strand and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Due to competitive binding, the target RNA that is complementary to the MB-CP will displace the AuRP strand. Magnetic separation was used to separate the target bound to MB-CP from the unbound (displaced) AuRP. 5 µL of the supernatant containing the displaced AuRP was used for signal detection. 5 µL of the supernatant containing the displaced AuNP-RP was pipetted onto the working electrode surface of a 2-electrode screen printed carbon electrode or SPCE (Quasense, Thailand). This was followed by the addition of 50 µL of 1 M HBr/0.1 mM Br Protocols and use of leftover plasma samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University (IRB Number 028/63) and Mahidol University (MU-CIRB 2023/065.1702) and all subjects provided signed informed consent. All the experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. A total of 52 plasma samples (30 HCV-positive and 22 HCV-negative) were used to evaluate the assay. The samples were obtained as leftover plasma from a previous HCV diagnostic screening project of Thai residents in Phetchabun province The plasma samples were mixed with a high salt lysis buffer to lyse the HCV. Viral RNA was extracted from HCV-positive plasma samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was reverse transcribed using random hexa-primer and ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol Target hybridization and strand displacement were performed using 30 µL of either plasma sample, RNA, cDNA, or RT-PCR product. The sample was added to the pre-displacement duplex strand and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. After performing magnetic separation, 5 µL of the supernatant was used for electrochemical measurement. Gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and thiolated-DNA conjugation were achieved by using the salt aging method. The molar ratio of AuNPs and DNA probe (i.e. the DNA density on the AuNPs surface) is considered one of the main factors that affect colloidal stability and DNA recognition. The adsorption of small, thiol-containing molecules on a gold surface is a spontaneous reaction, this reaction is used to attach the thiolated DNA to the AuNP surface The AuNPs-reporter probe conjugate was resuspended with 25 mM Tris-acetate containing 8% sucrose which acted as a stabilizing agent (Fig.  Optimization of the assay conditions. ( The sensor works based on competitive hybridization between the target DNA / RNA in the sample with the AuRP in the pre-displacement duplex strand (Fig.  Detection of linear targets. ( Detection of HCV-LT and RT-PCR product at different concentrations was performed to determine the sensitivity of the assay. The result showed a positive linear correlation between the logarithmic concentrations of the linear target DNA and the current response (R Sensitivity and specificity of the assay. ( The specificity of the assay indicated that only the samples containing HCV-LT yielded positive signals (Fig.  Besides that, the positive signal was obtained when HCV-LT is present with the DNA of other viruses (Fig.  The analytical performance of the developed electrochemical biosensor was compared with previously published biosensors for HCV as shown in Table  Comparison of our platform with various HCV biosensors. HCV-RNA Human serum DPV, Differential pulse voltammetry method; EIS, Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; CV, Cyclic voltammetric method; SWV, Square wave voltammetric method; CA, Chronoamperometry; DPASV, Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. Moreover, several advantages were encountered in our platform in terms of hybridization time, specificity assay, discriminating single base pair mismatch, visual detection, and application of real sample. First, hybridization time of target with capture probe was shorter (30 min) and we detected linear targets from different infectious diseases to show the ability of our platform to detect co-infection as well as differentiate other infections. Discriminating single base pair mismatch added more value for high specificity. In addition to electrochemical detection, visual detection of released AuRP (red color) gave an advantage of first qualitative decision before quantitative measurement. Therefore, our sensor is best for real application to detect HCV-RNA from plasma compared to previous studies. A total of 52 plasma samples (30 HCV positive and 22 HCV negative) were used to detect HCV RNA without any extraction. Then, RNA was extracted from 30 HCV-positive samples and cDNA was synthesized from 20 HCV-positive samples (from extracted RNA). All the samples were checked for HCV RNA individually with electrochemical detection. Figure  HCV with electrochemical detection in clinical samples. ( In our study, we obtained the leftover plasma samples and extracted RNA and cDNA from a previous study that quantitatively measured the HCV RNA viral load among Phetchabun residents in Thailand using RT-PCR on the Cobas 4800 System In our study, we used a simple lysis step which involved the lysis of viral form and release of its RNA in plasma. This shows that the highly sensitive biosensor could detect the HCV RNA without the need for purified RNA or an amplification step such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Studies have also identified HCV RNA from saliva samples of patients We developed a highly sensitive and specific electrochemical biosensor using the principle of target hybridization and strand displacement for the detection of HCV. The biosensor could detect as little as 4 fM of linear targets and 43 ng/µL of RT-PCR product. It could also be used to detect viral nucleic acid directly in plasma samples, as well as extracted HCV RNA and cDNA. With the growing burden of HCV globally, the short turnaround time and isothermal assay condition make this sensor an excellent choice for “point-of-care testing” (POCT) of HCV.

11470067,Employing machine learning techniques for prediction of micronutrient supplementation status during pregnancy in East African Countries,"Micronutrient deficiencies, known as “hidden hunger” or “hidden malnutrition,” pose a significant health risk to pregnant women, particularly in low-income countries like the East Africa region. This study employed eight advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in 12 East African countries, using recent demographic health survey (DHS) data. The analysis involved 138,426 study samples, and algorithm performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), specificity, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the algorithms tested, the random forest classifier emerged as the top performer in predicting micronutrient supplementation status, exhibiting excellent evaluation scores (AUC = 0.892 and accuracy = 94.0%). By analyzing mean SHAP values and performing association rule mining, we gained valuable insights into the importance of different variables and their combined impact, revealing hidden patterns within the data. Key predictors of micronutrient supplementation were the mother’s education level, employment status, number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, access to media, number of children, and religion. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop targeted strategies to improve the uptake of micronutrient supplementation. Key intervention components involve enhancing education, strengthening ANC services, and implementing comprehensive media campaigns that emphasize the importance of micronutrient supplementation. It is also crucial to consider cultural and religious sensitivities when designing interventions to ensure their effectiveness and acceptance within the specific population. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to explore and experiment with various techniques to optimize algorithm performance, leading to the identification of the most effective predictors and enhanced accuracy in predicting micronutrient supplementation status.","Micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, are essential for the human body in micrograms or milligrams per day Pregnancy-related micronutrient deficiencies have implications for the health of pregnant women and the development of their children The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with member states and other partners, invests significant efforts to address all forms of malnutrition. These initiatives encompass high-folic acid and iron supplementation and fortification of food with micronutrients Existing literature on micronutrient intake and deficiency has identified several potential factors contributing to these deficiencies Machine learning technologies have witnessed widespread adoption and achieved remarkable advancements in various fields. However, their application in the realm of public health and medicine has been relatively limited This study utilized secondary data from the most recent DHS conducted in 12 East African countries, namely Ethiopia (2016), Kenya (2014), Uganda (2016), Tanzania (2016), Burundi (2017), Rwanda (2015), Madagascar (2009), Mozambique (2011), Zimbabwe (2015), Zambia (2018), Malawi (2016), and Comoros (2012). The data sets from these countries were extracted from the official DHS program database, which can be accessed at  The DHS Program has conducted standardized surveys in over 90 countries, collecting representative data on population, health, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and nutrition. The surveys used a multi-stage stratified sampling method, selecting participants from households within clusters. Sampling strata were created based on rural and urban sectors, and enumeration areas were chosen using probability proportional to size. Within the selected enumeration areas, households were chosen using equal probability systematic sampling. The study specifically examined women aged 15 to 49 residing in East Africa, focusing on those who had been pregnant within the preceding five years of data collection. The research sample included a total of 138,426 individuals from 12 countries in East Africa. The dataset utilized in the study comprised 13 features The dependent variable in this study was micronutrient supplementation, defined as the usage of iron folic acid tablets or syrup for at least ninety days or the usage of deworming medicine during a previous pregnancy The process of machine learning begins with data pre-processing, which involves modifying or encoding the data to make it suitable for computer interpretation 
 Study work flow diagram. During the data analysis process, we manually examined the data for redundancy and determined that no redundant data were present in our dataset. To handle missing values, we utilized the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation technique Feature engineering involves identifying, acquiring, and modifying the most relevant characteristics from the available data to construct machine learning models that are more accurate and efficient We employed various techniques for dimensionality reduction in our study, aiming to optimize model performance and reduce the complexity of our dataset. These techniques included univariate selection, recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest feature elimination, principal component analysis (PCA), lasso regression, and a feature selection method based on Boruta Through repeated experiments, we found that the Boruta-based feature selection method outperformed other techniques in terms of accuracy and robustness. The Boruta-based feature selection method assesses feature importance by comparing their performance against randomly generated shadow features that simulate noise. Features consistently outperforming the shadow features are deemed significant and incorporated into our predictive model Data imbalance poses a common challenge in data mining and machine learning, often leading to decreased classification accuracy for instances belonging to the minority class Under-sampling involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to achieve a more balanced dataset. By randomly removing instances from the majority class, under-sampling aims to align the number of instances in the minority class with that in the majority class. This approach prevents classifier bias towards the majority class, but it may result in the loss of potentially valuable information On the other hand, over-sampling increases the number of instances in the minority class by replicating or generating new instances. This technique ensures a balanced dataset by ensuring that the number of instances in the minority class is comparable to that in the majority class. Over-sampling can be achieved through methods such as random duplication, bootstrapping, or synthetic data generation ADASYN extends the SMOTE technique to address its limitation in handling datasets with varying densities within the minority class. ADASYN synthesizes new instances in the minority class by considering the distribution of instances in the feature space. It focuses on generating more synthetic examples for the minority class instances that are harder to classify, thereby adapting the sampling strategy to the local characteristics of the data SMOTE, on the other hand, is a popular over-sampling technique that creates synthetic instances in the minority class by interpolating between existing instances. It randomly selects a minority class instance and identifies its k nearest neighbors. It then generates synthetic instances by randomly selecting a neighbor and creating a new instance along the line segment between the original instance and the chosen neighbor. SMOTE helps balance the dataset and introduces diversity in the minority class To enhance the performance of our predictive model, we initially trained our machine learning algorithms using unbalanced data. Subsequently, we explored and applied the aforementioned balancing techniques to train the models using balanced datasets. To evaluate the performance of each model across each data balancing technique, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using five performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. While accuracy is suitable for evaluating models with balanced classes, AUC becomes particularly valuable when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when the relative costs of false positives and false negatives are uncertain. However, it is advisable to consider both accuracy and AUC, along with other relevant metrics, to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of model performance and make informed comparisons between different machine learning algorithms In our study, the dependent variable, micronutrient supplementation status, required a classification approach, as it was divided into “supplemented” and “not supplemented” categories. To make predictions, we needed to select appropriate classifiers. We utilized the Scikit-learn version 1.3.2 packages in Python, implemented within Jupyter Notebook, to employ machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms for predicting micronutrient supplementation status, we employed eight state-of-the-art algorithms. Each algorithm has its unique approach and characteristics. Here are brief definitions for each of the algorithms we utilized: 
 Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Kernel Methods: SVM is a powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space to separate different classes Gaussian Naive Bayes: This algorithm is based on Bayes’ theorem, assuming that features are conditionally independent. It is particularly effective when dealing with high-dimensional data Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a statistical model that is used for binary classification. It estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class based on the input features Decision Tree Classifier: Decision trees are hierarchical structures that make decisions based on the values of input features. The decision tree classifier uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences to predict the class label of instances Random Forest Classifier: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. It generates a set of decision trees and makes predictions by averaging the outputs of individual trees Gradient Boosting Machines: Gradient boosting is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. It trains new models to correct the mistakes made by previous models eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting that provides better performance and scalability. It employs a variety of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and enhance the overall predictive power KNN: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies instances based on their similarity to neighboring instances. It assigns a class label to an instance by considering the labels of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space The selection of these algorithms was based on their suitability for classification tasks and their compatibility with the characteristics of our dataset In order to construct a reliable predictive model within machine learning, it is essential to perform model training and evaluation To evaluate the performance of the predictive models, several metrics were utilized, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Each of these metrics provides valuable insights into different aspects of the model’s performance. 
 Accuracy: Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model’s predictions. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision: Precision evaluates the accuracy of positive predictions made by the model. It quantifies the proportion of true positive predictions out of the total predicted positives. The formula for precision is: Precision = TP / (TP + FP) where TP represents true positive and FP represents false positive. 
 Recall: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, assesses the model’s ability to identify all positive instances. It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of the total actual positives. The formula for recall is: Recall = TP / (TP + FN) where TP represents true positive and FN represents false negative. 
 F1-score: The F1-score provides a balanced measure of a model’s performance by considering both precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it is calculated using the following formula: F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). 
 AUC: AUC is a metric calculated from the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve represents the true positive rate (TPR) plotted against the false positive rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. AUC indicates the algorithm’s ability to discriminate between classes, where a higher AUC value suggests better discrimination. In summary, by utilizing these metrics, we were able to comprehensively evaluate the performance of each predictive model in terms of overall correctness, accurate positive predictions, identification of positive instances, balanced measure, and discriminatory ability In order to further evaluate the performance of the model, tenfold cross-validation techniques were employed. Prior to this, different k-fold validation techniques, including three-fold, five-fold, and ten-fold, were compared to determine the most suitable approach The study also conducted a thorough analysis of hyperparameters to refine and improve the model’s performance. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization were systematically explored to find the best hyperparameter settings. Comparing the outcomes from these techniques helped identify the configurations that provided the highest performance. In order to improve the accuracy and dependability of the model used in this study, we conducted model calibration. Through fine-tuning the model via calibration, we enhanced its performance in accurately predicting the desired outcome. In our study, we conducted an extensive comparison of different kernel methods for the SVM model, with the main goal of identifying the most suitable kernel function to maximize the model’s performance. We carefully evaluated and compared various kernel functions, including linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Through meticulous analysis, our objective was to select the kernel method that produced the most favorable outcomes and achieved optimal performance for the SVM model In our comprehensive approach to understanding the data and exploring the factors influencing the prediction of micronutrient supplementation, we employed various techniques including the Apriori algorithm. Firstly, we calculated the mean SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) values to assess the average impact of each feature on the model’s predictions, providing insights into the relative significance of different variables. This allowed us to understand the individual contributions of each feature. Additionally, we utilized the Apriori algorithm, a popular algorithm for association rule mining. By applying the Apriori algorithm, we were able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships among the variables in the dataset. The algorithm allowed us to discover frequent item sets and association rules based on measures such as lift and confidence. Lift helped us determine the strength of the associations between different variables, indicating the degree to which the presence of one variable influences the likelihood of another variable occurring. Confidence, on the other hand, provided us with a measure of reliability or certainty in the association rules, indicating how often the consequent variable appeared when the antecedent variable was present By incorporating mean SHAP values and the Apriori algorithm into our analysis, we gained a deeper understanding of the dataset and the factors influencing the prediction of micronutrient supplementation. These techniques allowed us to uncover concealed patterns and relationships, leading to robust predictions and identification of influential factors. In summary, our approach involved calculating mean SHAP values to determine feature importance and utilizing the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining. This comprehensive methodology provided us with valuable insights into the dataset, enhancing model interpretability and facilitating a better understanding of the factors impacting micronutrient supplementation predictions The study encompassed a comprehensive analysis of descriptive and socio-demographic characteristics among a weighted sample of 138,426 pregnant women. Among the participants, the largest proportion, comprising 57,174 (41.30%), fell within the age group of 26 to 34 years. In terms of residence, the majority, accounting for 105,613 (76.30%) of the study participants, hailed from rural areas. Regarding employment status, a significant number of respondents, totaling 101,407 (73.26%), were employed (See Table  
 Individual characteristics of reproductive age group women in east African countries ( According to the specified DHS dataset, the pooled prevalence of micronutrient supplementation status among pregnant women in East Africa was found to be 28.90% (95% CI: 28.68, 29.12). Ethiopia had the lowest rate of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women, with only 7.80% receiving supplementation. On the other hand, Zambia had the highest prevalence of micronutrient supplementation, with 66.94% of pregnant women receiving supplementation (See Fig.  
 Prevalence of micronutrient supplementation status among pregnant women in East Africa countries using forest tree plot. Upon evaluating various feature selection methods, we observed that the Boruta algorithm exhibited strong performance. As depicted in Fig.  In our comprehensive analysis, we decided to exclude birth interval and marital status from consideration, as the Boruta algorithm deemed them unimportant. No tentative variables were identified. Consequently, we proceeded with utilizing the variables selected by the Boruta algorithm to predict the micronutrient supplementation status and explore data patterns through association rule mining.

Based on the findings presented in Fig.  Additionally, religion, working status, education status, age group, and wealth status displayed minimal influence on the classification outcome, as evidenced by their low mean SHAP values. These features contribute less to the model’s decision-making process and have limited importance on the model prediction. On the other hand, residence and perceived distance were positioned at the bottom of the graph, with a mean SHAP value of zero. This suggests that these features do not contribute to the model prediction. 
 A mean SHAP value report. Using the Apriori algorithm, our research identified the most influential association rules based on their lift values and confidence. These rules provided valuable insights into the probability of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy in East African countries. Remarkably, the recurring presence of factors such as maternal education level, employment status, ANC visit, media accessibility, number of living children, and religion in these association rules indicated their consistent association with the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. The top five association rules and their corresponding lift values are as follows: 
 1. If the mother has a secondary education, is employed, has more than four ANC visits, and has media exposure, the probability of being supplemented with micronutrients is 86.3% (Confidence = 0.863 and lift = 2.36). 2. If the mother is in the age group of 21 to 25, has less than three children, has more than four ANC visits, and follows the catholic religion, the probability of being supplemented with micronutrients is 85.9% (Confidence = 0.859 and lift = 2.04). 3. If the mother has less than three children, access to media, follows the Catholic religion, and has higher education, the probability of being supplemented with micronutrients is 81.4% (Confidence = 0.814 and lift = 1.64). 4. If the mother has less than three children, is employed, in the age group of 26 to 34, has higher education, and follows the traditional or animist religion, the probability of being supplemented with micronutrients is 78.4% (Confidence = 0.784 and lift = 1.83). 5. If the mother has four ANC visits, is employed, has access to media, belongs to a high-income wealth status, and has a primary education, the probability of being supplemented with micronutrients is 74.3% (Confidence = 0.743 and lift = 1.25). The study demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in accurately predicting the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in East Africa. The random forest classifier, decision tree classifier, and XGBoost were identified as the most effective models for classifying supplementation status. Specifically, the random forest classifier outperformed other algorithms, with an AUC value of 0.892 and an accuracy of 94.0%. Similar studies conducted in Rwanda We used association rule mining to identify the top predictors in our data set. Accordingly, we built five top rules using association rule mining and implied that the mother’s education level consistently appeared in association rules and had a significant impact on the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. The justification for this impact was supported by the existing research literature. Similar to our findings studies conducted in Central Ethiopia Based on the finding of the association rule mining, ANC visits were a strong predictor that influenced the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. This finding was supported by global studies highlighting the significance of ANC visits in enhancing supplementation status Association rule mining consistently demonstrated that religion played a significant role in determining the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. This finding underscores the importance of considering religious factors in public health interventions and highlights the need for culturally sensitive strategies to address micronutrient deficiencies in diverse religious communities The association rule mining consistently demonstrated that an increase in the number of children had a negative association with the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. This association was supported by the literature, which underscores the significance of family size as a determinant of access to and utilization of health services The association rule mining consistently provided evidence that individuals with media exposure had a higher probability of receiving adequate micronutrient supplementation. This finding was further supported by the literature, which emphasized the role of media in influencing health-related behaviors The consistent findings from association rule mining indicate that individuals who had primary, secondary, and higher levels of education are more likely to receive micronutrient supplementation. Previous studies conducted worldwide supported this relationship The association rule mining consistently revealed the significant impact of employment status on the likelihood of receiving micronutrient supplementation. This finding was consistent with a study conducted in Northwest Ethiopia The study demonstrates its strength by employing a comprehensive analysis of predictive capabilities through the use of eight supervised machine-learning algorithms. This approach enhances the reliability and credibility of the findings by revealing hidden patterns and relationships within the data. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations associated with the study. The retrospective data collection and reliance on secondary data introduce potential drawbacks, including the possibility of incomplete or missing data, which may impact the accuracy and introduce biases in the results. Additionally, the study only explores four data balancing techniques, which may limit the ability to fully harness the potential power of each machine learning algorithm. Another limitation is the absence of exploring the performance of each algorithm through ensembling, a technique that combines multiple models to enhance predictive accuracy. Lastly, it is worth noting that the study shares the inherent limitation of building association rules solely based on the Apriori algorithm. The study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in accurately predicting the status of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women in East Africa. Notably, the random forest classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving excellent evaluation scores with an AUC of 0.892 and an accuracy of 94.0% in predicting the supplementation status. This emphasizes the potential of machine learning algorithms as valuable tools for policymakers and healthcare providers to develop targeted strategies aimed at improving the uptake of micronutrient supplementation among pregnant women. Based on the study’s findings, several key intervention components are recommended to enhance the utilization of micronutrient supplementation. Strengthening educational initiatives can provide vital information on the importance and benefits of supplement intake. Improving antenatal care services ensures proper screening, monitoring, and guidance for pregnant women regarding their nutritional needs. Comprehensive media campaigns can effectively raise awareness and emphasize the significance of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. It is also crucial to consider cultural and religious sensitivities when designing interventions to ensure their acceptance and effectiveness within the specific population. Furthermore, researchers are encouraged to explore and experiment with various techniques to optimize algorithm performance, leading to the identification of the most effective predictors and enhanced accuracy in predicting micronutrient supplementation status.","['Micronutrient supplementation', 'Pregnant women', 'Demographic health survey', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Nutrition', 'Health care', 'Medical research']",2024-10-11,Scientific Reports,HIV

Almost 705 million cases and 7 million deaths of COVID-19 have been documented worldwide The world health organization prequalified COVID-19 vaccines based on several promising platforms including adenovirus vector vaccines (Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, Janssen), inactivated virus vaccines (Sinopharm BIBP, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Valneva), mRNA vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna), and subunit vaccines (Novavax, Sanofi–GSK) Mass vaccination of COVID-19 started on 7th February, 2021 in Bangladesh The main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of both short and long-term side effects of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine taken as homogenous doses and heterogenous doses among the adult population in Bangladesh.

Both in second and third doses higher prevalence of breakthrough cases were reported among the homogenous vaccinated participants of Oxford–AstraZeneca (17.2% and 30.2%, respectively) than Sinopharm BIBP and heterogenous vaccinated participants (Table  Severity of adverse effects were defined and categorized into five groups, namely very mild, mild, moderate, severe and very severe based on the previously published articles. First dose: Majority of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine recipients reported moderate side effects (44%) followed by mild (32%), severe (12%) and very mild (11%), respectively. On the contrary, Sinopharm BIBP recipients had mild side effects (54%) in higher frequency followed by very mild (27%) and moderate (18%) effects. Both short- and long-term side effects were significantly higher among Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine recipients (92% and 57%, respectively) than Sinopharm BIBP recipients (Fig.  
 Adverse effects severity among the recipients of (A) First dose, (B) Second dose and (C) Third dose. Second dose: Frequency of adverse effects after second dose of Oxford–AstraZeneca and Sinopharm BIBP were similar to the severity of first dose. Both for Moderna (56%) and Pfizer-BioNTech (51%), moderate effects were prevalent followed by mild (23% and 28%) and severe (16% and 17%) effects, respectively. Further, Sinovac recipients reported mild effects (55%) in higher percentage followed by very mild (33%) and moderate (18%). Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac recipients experienced higher frequency of both short- and long-term side effects (68-85% and 57-64%, respectively) than Oxford–AstraZeneca or Sinopharm BIBP recipients in second dose (Fig.  Third dose: Frequency of severe and very severe adverse effects reduced (< 6%) after third dose than first and second dose vaccination among the participants. Higher percentage of moderate side effects was reported among the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech recipients (> 38-43%) than other vaccines. Participants with Moderna (84% and 65%) and Pfizer-BioNTech (78% and 58%) vaccination experienced higher percentage of short and long-term effects followed by Oxford–AstraZeneca (58% and 65%) and Sinovac (48% and 58%), respectively (Fig.  After the first dose of vaccination, about 97.5% (1760 of 1805) recipients experienced adverse effects. All of the adverse effects were more prevalent among the recipients of Oxford–AstraZeneca than Sinopharm BIBP. Among the Oxford–AstraZeneca recipients, pain at the injection site (95.6%) was the most prevalent effect followed by fever (78.4%), myalgia (74.8%), headache (60.4%), heaviness in the injected hand (57.7%), redness at the injection site (52%) and chills (47.9%), respectively. Recipients of Sinopharm BIBP reported different skin problems including itchy skin (83%), psoriasis (64%), and urticaria (54%) as prevalent side effects followed by pain at the injection site (54%) and hand (49%), respectively. However, thrombosis after vaccination was only reported among 3.7% of the Oxford–AstraZeneca recipients (Table  
 Side effects associated with first dose vaccination. Pain at the injection site OA- Oxford–AstraZeneca; S- Sinopharm BIBP; * >6 months. Local and systemic adverse effects after vaccination with Oxford–AstraZeneca and Sinopharm BIBP as homogenous dose in second shot reduced by 15–25% than first dose. However, various skin problems after 6 months of the second dose increased among these vaccine recipients. Among the participants with the Moderna vaccine, the majority of the local and systemic side effects were found in the highest frequency (80-99%). Pain at the injection site (98.9%) and fever (98.9%) was the most common adverse effects among them followed by heaviness in the injected hand (96.7%), pain in the hand (95.7%), redness in the site (93.5%), and headache (91.3%), respectively. Similarly, among the Pfizer-BioNTech (70-95%) vaccine recipients, side effects were found more frequently than Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, and Sinovac. We found around 60-80% of the second-dose recipients reported skin-related side effects including itchy skin, psoriasis, rash, and urticaria after three months. Events like thrombosis were only found among 3.5% of Oxford–AstraZeneca recipients (Table

Side effects after the third dose of COVID-19 vaccines were reduced than the second or first dose among the participants. The recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech experienced elevated levels of local (86-100%) and systemic (60-75%) adverse effects than other vaccines. Further, the recipients of the Moderna vaccine reported elevated adverse effects; local effects (70-90%) and systemic effects (65-95%). Thrombosis persisted only among the Oxford–AstraZeneca recipients (5.7%) after the third dose (Table  A multivariable logistic regression model was built to determine the risk factors of adverse effects reported by the vaccine recipients. Vaccination with any one of these COVID-19 vaccines had the highest odds of adverse effects (OR 4.89, 95% CI 4.61–5.27) among the participants. Among other host factors, vaccine recipients’ sex (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.12–1.84), smoking habit (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.54), previous COVID-19 infection (OR 2.43, 95% CI 2.15–2.87), preexisting diabetes (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02–1.54), autoimmune diseases (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01–1.43), asthma (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07–1.59) and COPD (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13–1.76) were significantly associated with higher odds of adverse effects. Recipients of the Moderna (OR 4.29, 95% CI 3.87–4.58) vaccine had the highest odds of adverse effects followed by Oxford–AstraZeneca (OR 4.24, 95% CI 3.99–4.68), Pfizer-BioNTech (OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.88–3.45), Sinopharm BIBP (OR 2.78, 95% CI 2.41–3.13) and Sinovac (OR 2.33, 95% CI 2.11–2.84), respectively in Bangladesh. Further, the odds of adverse effects were significantly higher in the participants with homogenous or heterogenous shots and single and/or, double and/or triple doses of vaccine (Table  
 Odds of adverse effects among the participants. We also determined the risk factors of developing severe or long-term side effects after vaccination among the study population. Similarly, we found that COVID-19 vaccination (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29–1.95), age (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05–1.53), sex (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.52–1.95), previous infection (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.29–1.95), COPD (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.36–1.95), asthma (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.34–1.97), tuberculosis (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.94) and long COVID (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.35–1.98) increased the odds of severe and long-term effects significantly. Further, recipients of heterogenous doses (OR 3.13, 95% CI 2.78–3.51) and double doses (OR 3.53, 95% CI 3.18–3.95) had higher odds of long-term and severe events. Among the administered vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech (OR 4.34, 95% CI 3.95–4.58) had the highest odds of long-term and severe effects followed by Moderna (OR 4.15, 95% CI 3.92–4.69), Oxford–AstraZeneca (OR 3.89, 95% CI 3.45–4.06), Sinovac (OR 3.49, 95% CI 3.23–3.95), and Sinopharm BIBP (OR 3.16, 95% CI 3.03–3.71), respectively (Table  
 Odds of severe and long-term adverse effects among the participants. Vaccines against COVID-19 were necessary to prevent unprecedented death and morbidity worldwide Second, we found a reduction in vaccine recipients from the first dose to the second dose and the second dose to the third dose. About 25.7% and 48.9% of recipients reduced from first to second and first to third dose, respectively, followed by 31.8% reduction from second to third dose. This finding is fully supported by both the national and international data on vaccination Fourth, we found thrombosis among the participants was only associated with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. Event of thrombosis ranged from 3.5 to 5.7% among the recipients of homogenous Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. This statement is in good agreement with previous findings from numerous studies worldwide This study has several limitations. They include, self-reported data from the participants, the number of participants with Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines could be increased, and detailed histopathological data are missing. In the future, the inclusion of data from histopathological analysis could give more accurate predictions associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Though we designed the study in a prospective way to reduce the recall bias, there might be minor recall bias from a small number of the participants. This study reported a high prevalence of side effects after COVID-19 vaccination in Bangladesh. Both local and systemic effects within 48 h of vaccination were more frequent among the recipients of Oxford–AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Long-term effects including urticaria, psoriasis, and skin allergic conditions after 6 months of vaccination were prevalent in the study population. This study created a comprehensive insight into short- and long-term side effects as well as health effects of homogenous and heterogenous doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The study was reviewed and approved by the Biosafety, Biosecurity & Ethical Committee at Jahangirnagar University, with an ethical approval number of BBEC, JU/M 2021/COVID-19/(8)1. This prospective study was conducted using an observational design across Bangladesh. The study spanned from May 5, 2021, to April 4, 2023. Data collection involved a structured questionnaire. We collected the data from the participants after 1 h to the next two weeks of vaccination. For the long-term observation, they were given access to the questionnaire and instructions to report within the first three days of observation of any symptom. Convenience sampling was used to enroll the participants and they were invited through online platforms. Participants from all around the 64 districts in Bangladesh were included in this study. The study included all participants from different sex, race, religion, or occupation, ensuring a reduction in potential biases. Data acquisition encompassed both direct participants and hospitalized individuals seeking treatment for non-COVID-19 related illness, along with their visiting relatives. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Relevant guidelines and regulations were followed to conduct this study. For grading the severity of the side effects, we used the Food and Drug Administration recommendations. Mild side effects were determined by following grade 1 (awareness of signs or symptoms but freely endured) and severe effects by grade 3 (inability to work or do usual activity) of the guideline The inclusion criteria consisted of several parameters including, the participant must be a resident of Bangladesh, aged 18 years or above, having taken one or more doses of vaccine not other than Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinopharm BIBP, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac and Moderna, given complete information in the questionnaire, did not receive any dose of COVID-19 vaccine outside Bangladesh, have not taken any other vaccines before 2 years and after COVID-19 vaccination. Exclusion criteria consisted of different factors like participants not giving complete information on the questionnaire, aged below 18 years, not a resident of Bangladesh, having taken any of the doses of COVID-19 vaccines from outside Bangladesh, having taken other vaccines within the last 2 years, have severe COVID-19 infection and taken antiserum during treatment. The structured questionnaire was divided into three main sections. The first section included socio-demographic questions including age, sex, occupation, residential location, and prior COVID-19 infection history, previous health conditions, type of vaccine, and vaccination date. The second section focused on side effects after vaccination, any adverse effects post-vaccination, their duration, occurrences of COVID-19 post-vaccination, and the severity of infections post-first vaccine dose, effects on different organs and systems. The third section included questions on post-dose effects and duration after the first dose, second dose, third dose or combined doses. The questionnaire, prepared in both Bangla and English, was disseminated nationwide. The sample size was determined based on existing literature and it was about  The baseline data and responses to demographic questions were represented by using descriptive statistics such as mean, median, SD, and IQR. For these characteristics differences in responses for continuous variables, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test. We also performed the χ2 test for the responses including categorical variables. For the identification of responsible factors with the prevalence of different side effects among the vaccine recipients, we used a multivariable logistic regression model. The participants were allowed to access the questionnaire multiple times required to give responses after 2nd doses and 3rd doses of vaccines. We considered different factors in the multivariable model including included age of the participants (continuous variables with class interval of 10 years), ethnicity (Bangladeshi or outsider) sex given at birth (male or female), subjective socioeconomic conditions, residential areas (urban or rural), number of vaccine dose, type of COVID-19 vaccine, preexisting medical conditions (both non-communicable and infectious diseases and other health conditions), smoking history and blood grouping. We used another separate multivariable model to determine the associated factors responsible for no side effects, very mild, mild, moderate side effects vs. severe or very severe adverse effects by using previously described factors of the participants. We considered the findings statistically significant, if ","['Side effects, COVID-19 vaccines', 'Long-term', 'Heterogenous', 'Bangladesh', 'Signs and symptoms', 'Vaccines']",2024-10-11,Scientific Reports,HIV
11469972,Teachers’ Perceptions of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Implementation of an Evidence-based HIV Prevention Program in the Bahamas,"Information on how school-based programs is implemented and sustained during crises is limited. In this study, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of a HIV prevention intervention in The Bahamas. Data were collected from 139 Grade 6 teachers in 2021–2022. Teachers attended virtual training and received implementation monitoring from coordinators. On average, teachers taught 26.4 (SD = 9.2) of the 35 core activities, and 7.4 (SD = 2.4) out of 9 sessions. More than half (58.3%) of teachers completed 28 or more core activities; 69.1% covered eight or all nine sessions, which is equivalent to 80% of the HIV intervention curriculum. Almost half of the teachers (43%) reported that the pandemic negatively impacted their ability to teach the program; 72% of teachers maintained that the program remained “very important” during times of crisis. Greater self-efficacy and supports increased implementation fidelity.","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education sector worldwide, affecting 94% of the world’s students [ Globally, teachers faced significant barriers when adjusting to the educational environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their roles in their schools and classrooms changed immensely as they adapted curricula to virtual and hybrid instruction and modified pedagogy to fit the needs of their students [ In The Bahamas, over 102 school days were lost between 2019 and 2022 that had not been originally planned and were due to the pandemic [ The FOYC + CImPACT program was designed for adolescents and their parents to discuss safe sex skills (e.g., condom use) and to avoid, or reduce, risky behaviors such as substance use, delinquency, and sexual risk behaviors [ The implementation support study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, faced several additional barriers that placed an emphasis on teachers to build rapport and promote virtual participation in the program while students tried to engage from their homes, which may have lacked privacy to discuss sexual health and related issues [ Our study sample included 139 Grade 6 teachers representing 58 public elementary schools in The Bahamas. New Providence, the most populated island, had 80 teachers in 24 schools, and the Family Islands (including Grand Bahama) had 59 teachers in 34 schools. The research protocol was approved by the UMass Chan Medical School Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Review Board of the Bahamian Princess Margaret Hospital, Public Hospitals Authority. FOYC consists of 30 core activities, to be taught in eight sessions to Grade 6 students during Health and Family Life Education (HFLE) classes throughout the school year, with annual booster sessions in Grades 7 through 9. The single CImPACT parent session has five core activities and was incorporated into parent-teacher meetings. For the combined program, Grade 6 teachers are expected to cover 35 core activities in 9 sessions. Teachers received BMF and SAM to support their program implementation. Teachers were invited to attend a training webinar for FOYC + CImPACT, replacing the annual in-person training workshops. In three, 2-hour sessions, live instructor-led activities provided new FOYC + CImPACT teachers with the relevant curricular information and resources required to implement the program. Footage showed six Grade 6 teachers, who had experience implementing FOYC + CImPACT with high levels of fidelity, modeling the sessions and core activities of the program with 18 Grade 6 students. Trainers also conducted interactive didactic sessions to address sensitive questions that might arise in the classroom and increase teachers’ comfort with the material. Further, teachers received the situational analysis of HIV/AIDS and teen pregnancy in The Bahamas, a summary of FOYC efficacy research, an electronic copy of the FOYC + CImPACT manual, and access to online resources through the FOYC website. The webinar was delivered on the MOE’s Professional Development platform, and teachers could access recordings of it for reference. Sixty-one (76%) of the New Providence Grade 6 HFLE teachers attended the webinar; 16 (20%) of the teachers who did not attend the webinar had previously attended an FOYC + CImPACT training, and three (4%) teachers did not attend any training. Two Bahamian trainers with extensive experience with FOYC + CImPACT conducted 2- to 3-hour training sessions with school coordinators and mentors. A school coordinator was identified for each of the schools and trained to provide BMF. The coordinators monitored teachers’ progress in covering the FOYC + CImPACT sessions and core activities and reported any issues to the FOYC research office in New Providence. Twelve high-performing teachers were identified to be mentors and trained to provide SAM to at-risk or moderate-performing teachers. They helped identify teachers’ challenges, assisted teachers in preparing for sessions, and provided guidance on curriculum delivery. After each FOYC + CImPACT session, teachers completed a Teacher Implementation Checklist with which they documented which core activities were covered and whether they were taught exactly as outlined in the manual or whether any activities were modified. Teachers’ implementation fidelity was defined as the number of the 35 core activities of the FOYC + CImPACT curriculum taught throughout the year. Their degree of implementation was defined as the number of the 9 sessions completed. Trained observers attended ~ 10% of teachers’ sessions and completed the checklist to assess agreement between teachers’ and observers’ reports; agreement was high (~ 90%). Teachers completed pre- and post-implementation questionnaires to provide information known to influence implementation fidelity and to reflect on their perceptions of their ability to implement the program. Only 107 teachers completed the pre-implementation questionnaire; 104 teachers completed the post-implementation questionnaire. Teachers reported their level of formal education, years as a teacher, training attendance, their perceptions of the importance of HIV prevention for Grade 6 students (very important, somewhat important, or not at all important), their comfort level teaching the FOYC + CImPACT curriculum (very comfortable, somewhat comfortable, or not comfortable at all), and any competing lessons or teaching priorities. Teacher perceptions of school support to teach the program was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “totally disagree” to 5 = “totally agree”) with items such as “My principal expects FOYC to be taught to 6th graders.” [ School coordinators’ and mentors’ performance of BMF and SAM were monitored by the national school coordinator, the New Providence coordinator, The Bahamas FOYC project manager, and the FOYC curriculum trainers. Using a 14-item questionnaire, evaluators ranked school coordinators’ and mentors’ performance annually as “Unsatisfactory,” “Satisfactory,” “Good,” or “Excellent.” School coordinators were assessed on their knowledge of teachers’ implementation activities, communication with the FOYC research office, and submission of required materials. Mentors were rated for their performance, and the number of mentoring sessions they held during the academic year was noted. As noted earlier, we had been implementing additional teacher supports for implementing the program when the pandemic occurred (see Fig.  
 The conceptual diagram of the program components’ effects on teachers’ implementation fidelity before the COVID-19 pandemic ( First, using SAS 9.4 [ We conducted a thematic analysis [ On average, teachers taught 26.4 (SD = 9.2) of the 35 core activities, and 7.4 (SD = 2.4) out of 9 sessions. Out of 139 teachers, 81 (58.3%) teachers completed 28 or more core activities, and 96 (69.1%) covered eight or all nine sessions, which is equivalent to 80% of the HIV intervention curriculum. Twelve (8.6%) teachers covered fewer than 3 sessions; thirteen (9.4%) teachers taught fewer than 10 core activities. As shown in Table 1, teachers who perceived their school coordinators as very supportive of teaching FOYC taught more core activities than other teachers. Teachers who thought online training was not as effective as an in-person training workshop taught more sessions (8.8 vs. 7.8,  As shown in Table 2, teachers who had a “very good” or “excellent” school coordinator taught more core activities (28.9 and 28.1 on average) than those who had a “satisfactory” coordinator (22.4 on average) or no coordinator (22.3 on average) ( The strength of associations between implementation and factors influencing teachers’ self-efficacy was examined using Spearman correlation coefficients (Table 3). Teachers’ perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their ability to fulfill their teaching roles (including FOYC, CImPACT, and other subjects) were negatively related to their own self-efficacy ( Structural equation modeling demonstrated relations among the factors and their direct and indirect effects on implementation fidelity (i.e., number of core activities taught) (Fig.  In the revised model, teachers’ comfort level, attitudes toward sex education, perceived principal support, and performance of school coordinator predicted greater self-efficacy, which in turn predicted higher implementation. Teachers’ self-efficacy and performance of school coordinator had positive direct effects on implementation degree. Teachers’ comfort level was positively related to teachers’ confidence and perceived principal support. The impact of COVID was negatively related to teachers’ confidence and comfort level. The overall fit of the revised SEM model was excellent (CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.975, RMSEA = 0.05, χ The mediation effect analysis indicated that self-efficacy mediated the relation between the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, teacher’s level of comfort with the FOYC curriculum, perceived principal support, and teachers’ implementation degree (impact of COVID:  Themes, subthemes, and representative quotes for the free-response questions are summarized in Table  Three themes emerged from the teachers’ responses to this question: [ Teachers’ responses to this question also revealed three themes: [ Three themes also emerged from teachers’ responses to this question: [ Responses to this question fell into three themes: [ Six themes arose from the responses to this question [ The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for the implementation of FOYC + CImPACT in The Bahamas. We examined teachers’ perceptions of the pandemic’s impacts on their ability to teach the program and found that teachers who perceived negative impacts from the pandemic on their ability to teach the program had lower comfort levels, confidence, and self-efficacy. However, higher self-efficacy predicted greater implementation and mediated the relation between teachers’ perceived impacts of COVID-19 and their degree of implementation even during the pandemic. Teachers’ comfort levels, attitudes toward sex education, and perceived principal support, and school coordinators’ performances providing BMF increased their self-efficacy and, in turn, implementation fidelity. Our implementation supports, especially BMF and annual training to increase teachers’ comfort with and attitudes about the curriculum, and administration buy-in from principals may have facilitated teachers’ implementation of FOYC + CImPACT nationwide. On average, teachers taught ~ 75% of the curriculum despite barriers during the pandemic, providing their students with opportunities to learn critical skills to reduce risk behaviors. Teachers in New Providence on average taught more sessions and covered more core activities than those in the Family Islands, and the New Providence teachers were more likely to have access to school coordinators, peer mentors, and other structural supports (e.g., strong broadband) than those in the Family Islands. Based on these findings, we would propose to continue to include local supports from the school environment but also mentorship and modeling that could be provided virtually (as was done in this study) by coordinators. Most of the Grade 6 teachers in The Bahamas (72%) agreed that continuing to teach FOYC + CImPACT during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic remained “very important,” which is supported by experts’ opinions [ Although 71% of our teachers stated that engaging the students during FOYC sessions was what they enjoyed most about the program, 59% noted that interacting with students was especially challenging during virtual instruction. Students across the globe experienced mental health issues during the pandemic because of social isolation [ Despite highlighting teachers’ perspectives about the implementation of FOYC + CImPACT during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has several limitations. The phrasing of some of the open-ended questions may have biased some teachers’ responses. Namely, “What are the challenges that some teachers may have when engaging Grade 6 students in frank discussions on sensitive topics?” and “Why would some Grade 6 teachers not want to teach the FOYC curriculum?” solicited conjecture of  Experts have stressed the importance of increasing teachers’ self-efficacy and flexibility when adjusting to new educational challenges [

11469966,Intersecting Epidemics: The Predictors of Continued Utilization of HIV Care and Treatment Services During the COVID-19 Outbreak Among People Living with HIV in ZIMBABWE,"Globally, there have been considerable achievements towards HIV care and treatment. AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 60% since the peak in 2004. Potentially, the fight against the HIV epidemic was made more difficult with the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, this study examined the implications of COVID-19 in the utilization of HIV care and treatment services among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Zimbabwe. The study aimed to identify the critical factors defining the utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19 using the fifth revision of the Anderson Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization. The study utilized a concurrent triangulation design of which only one data collection phase was used. The quantitative data was collected from 2,157 people living with HIV on antiretroviral viral therapy through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. On the other hand, qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews. Regarding accessing ART refills, the study findings revealed that adolescents aged 15–19 (aOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.18–3.96) had higher odds of utilizing ART refills compared to their counterparts who were aged 20–24. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing the ART refill service (aOR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.49–3.24). Regarding accessing viral load monitoring adults aged 25–39 (aOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26–0.66) were less likely to utilize viral load monitoring compared to young people aged 20–24. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing the viral load monitoring service (aOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.36–2.87) than those not yet vaccinated. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing viral load monitoring (aOR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.09–2.08). Regarding tuberculosis preventative therapy, adults aged 25–39 (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.20–0.47) were less likely to utilize tuberculosis preventative therapy compared to young people aged 20–24. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis preventative therapy (aOR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.12–2.25) than those not yet vaccinated. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis preventive therapy (aOR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19–2.08). Regarding tuberculosis screening being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis screening services (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.41–2.54) than those not yet vaccinated. Although the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has dwindled, COVID-19 appears to come and go in waves, and a few countries are still recording relatively high cases. It is therefore likely that the factors associated with utilization of HIV services identified by the study such as age, residence, type of health facility, vaccination of COVID-19 and fear of contracting COVID-19, among others, need to be included when planning to improve access to health utilization.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse effects on the utilization of the broader sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The supply chain for key commodities was disrupted by the delays in the manufacture of key pharmaceutical components of contraceptive methods and by delays in the transportation of contraceptive commodities [ Regarding the fight against the HIV epidemic, antiretroviral therapy (ART) transformed HIV from being a terminal illness to being a chronic disease [ Globally, 39 million people were living with HIV and 27.5 million people were accessing ART in 2021 [ Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Zimbabwe has recorded 264,127 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 5,668 deaths in the second week of March 2023 [ The study utilized a concurrent triangulation design of which only one data collection phase was used through three different modalities. The quantitative data was collected from people living with HIV on ART through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The quantitative questionnaire asked about all the predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors as they related to accessing or not accessing the expected HIV care and treatment services per each sample person living with HIV on ART. The questionnaire was administered to adolescents and young people (15–24) by Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters from Zvandiri, while data for adults (25 +) was administered by Community Health Agents from Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV (ZNNP +). A total of 2,157 people living with HIV were sampled for the study of which 791 were adolescents and young people (15–24) and 1,366 were adults (25 +). On the qualitative data collection modality, qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews with purposively sampled key stakeholders such as 24 HIV volunteers, six district HIV focal persons and six health promotion officers. In the qualitative phase, in-depth and key informant interviews were done using a semi-structured interview guide. The semi-structured guide asked for information related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccinations during the COVID-19 period among people living with HIV. This information provided more understanding about the factors. The analysis of the quantitative and the qualitative data were conducted separately but concurrently. The dependent variable for this study was utilization of HIV care and treatment services. The outcome variable was defined as utilization of HIV care and treatment services which consisted of four services, namely, ART drug refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. Each of the outcome variables was coded as binary with “1” representing utilization of HIV care and treatment services and “0” representing non-utilization of HIV care and treatment services during the COVID-19 period. The study was premised on the fifth version of the Anderson health care services utilization model. This model argues that the actual use of health care services is a function of three factors classified as predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Firstly, the predisposing factors include socio-cultural characteristics of individuals that exist prior to their illness. These include demographic characteristics such as age and gender and social structural variables such as education, among others. Secondly, the enabling factors are those that involve the logistical aspects of obtaining care such as the resources available, whether individually or in a community. These may include the individual or family applying the means and know how to access health services, income, health insurance, a regular source of care, travel, and extent and quality of social relationships. At the community level, these may imply available health personnel and facilities and waiting time, among others. Thirdly, the need factors are the most immediate causes of health service use, including functional and health problems that generate the need for health care services. Figure  The health utilization model for HIV Care and treatment services in the context of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe The predisposing factors included: age (15–19, 20–24, 25–39, 40–54, 55 +), sex (male, female) marriage (not married, married), religion (Roman Catholic, Apostolic Sect, Pentecostal/Protestant, other religions), education (primary, secondary, tertiary, do not know/did not attend school/no answer), COVID-19 vaccination (yes/no). The enabling factors included: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, COVID-19 transport stoppages, distance to health facility, transport cost to health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, non-availability of community health care services, and COVID-19 related stigma among health care workers. The need factors included: opportunistic infection during COVID-19 period (yes/no), COVID-19 infection (yes/no), and contact with COVID-19 case (yes/no) while environmental factors included: residence (urban /rural) and type of health facility (central /provincial health facility, district health facility, primary health care facility). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14 software with 5% level of significance. Frequency distributions and the Chi-square test of association were used at the univariate and bivariate levels of analysis. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of utilizing HIV care and treatment services. All quantitative analyses were conducted at α = 0.05. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with corresponding p-values were reported. All covariates from the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis regardless of their significance. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using the NVIVO software (version 12). The NVIVO software is a software that allows for the collaboration and organisation of text data. Therefore, to review more significant effects from the in-depth interviews conducted in this study, NVIVO was used. As we conducted the interviews, we jotted down notes from the responses to the interview guide. We then created summaries and assigned codes to the data with the aid of the NVIVO software. We then categorised the codes and sorted the main themes that related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccination and the reasons for not accessing HIV services by predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors. Ethics approval was granted by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe under reference:  A total of 2,157 people living with HIV aged 15 years and older who were on ART before the advent of COVID-19 were included in the study as reported in Table  Distribution of socio-demographic characteristics of study participants (N = 2157) Table  Proportion of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods by predisposing, need and environmental factors (N = 2157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 Age was statistically significant at p = 0.00 at bivariate analysis across utilization of ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. We found that the age groups 20–24 and 25–39 contributed to the majority not utilizing (≥ 10%) for people living with HIV who had interruptions in accessing all the HIV services in this study which were accessing ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy, and TB screening. Older age groups from 40 years and older had higher utilization, such as ART refill and viral load monitoring with 96% utilization of ART refills and ≥ 92% on viral load monitoring. Religion was also statistically significant at the bivariate analysis with utilization of HIV services. In comparison to other religions and the apostolic sects, the study found a relatively lower utilization of ART refills in Roman Catholic (92%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (92%). The same trend was realized in TB preventative therapy with Roman Catholic (83%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (83%) utilization. The study revealed that there was a lower proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were not vaccinated for COVID-19. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. Education was also significantly associated with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening. The study revealed that there was a higher proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were vaccinated for COVID-19 than those not vaccinated. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. This followed 91% and 90% for viral load monitoring, 86% and 81% for TB preventative therapy and 76% and 68% for TB screening. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with utilization of HIV services. Females living with HIV who had been pregnant in the period of COVID-19 restrictions had higher utilization of HIV services. Regarding ART refills, pregnant females had a higher utilization of 94% compared to 93% for those that were never pregnant during the period. The same trend was similar for TB screening which was 77% and 73% for pregnant females and non-pregnant in the COVID-19 restriction period respectively. For viral load monitoring, the utilization proportion was similar at 90% for both, 86% and 85% respectively for TB preventive therapy. Opportunistic infections during the COVID-19 restriction period had relatively higher utilization proportion compared to people living with HIV who did not have opportunistic infections across all four HIV services. Opportunities infections were found statistically significant for utilization of viral load monitoring and TB preventative therapy. Thus, having an opportunistic infection and having no opportunistic infection respectively was 95% and 93% for ART refill, 95% and 89% for viral load monitoring, 89% and 85% for TB preventative therapy, and 87% and 75% for TB screening. Residence had significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB preventive therapy services. We found higher proportions of utilization across all four HIV services in rural areas compared to urban areas in the COVID-19 restriction period. For ART refill, there was 95% utilization in rural areas and 90% in urban areas. In viral load monitoring, there was 92% utilization in rural areas and 87% in urban areas. In TB preventative therapy, there was 87% utilization in rural areas and 82% in urban areas. In TB screening, there was 75% utilization in rural areas and 74% in urban areas. Concerning the type of health facility, there was significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening services. We found lower proportional utilization in central/provincial health facilities, then district health facilities and primary health facilities in that order. The TB screening utilization was 53% among people accessing services at central/provincial hospitals compared to 75% at primary health centers. COVID-19 lock down restrictions were noted as the major reason for not utilizing all four HIV services as shown in Fig.  Enabling factors: Reasons for non-utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restriction periods From the in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, it was apparent that some HIV services that used to be provided in the community were halted. This was most apparent in periods of high COVID-19 infections. “Community services in which ART was delivered in households or community viral load monitoring were difficult to conduct in COVID-19 times. This therefore meant some people living with HIV who used to enjoy these community services had to resort to coming to the facility where there was fear contracting COVID-19”. (Key stakeholder). Our study findings revealed that adolescents aged 15–19 (aOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.18–3.96) had higher odds of utilizing ART refills compared to their counterparts who were aged 20–24 as reported in Table  “There was a smaller number of COVID-19 cases in rural areas compared to urban areas; COVID-19 was heavily urban hence the utilization challenges followed suit.” (Key informant interview) Multivariate logistic regression analysis of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods (N = 2157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 In-depth interviews gave reasons such as overcrowding in urban areas as the major drivers of HIV utilization challenges after the advent of COVID-19. Accessing health services at district health facilities was significantly associated with higher odds of accessing ART refills (aOR = 5.48; 95% CI: 2.07–14.50), than those accessing at central and provincial hospitals. Regarding enabling factors, the fear of contracting COVID-19 was significantly associated with accessing ART refills (aOR = 4.54; 95% CI 1.94–10.64). In the qualitative in-depth interviews, 70% of community volunteers felt that there was fear among people living with HIV that COVID-19 infection may have more severe outcomes. “People living with HIV did not want anything that will lead to compromising their immune system.” (Community volunteer in-depth interview) Hence, there was a push was to ensure that clients’ HIV services were always met, and they remained immune strong against COVID-19 if affected. All in-depth and key informant interviews did not find religion as having had an influence on access to HIV services during the COVID-19 period. Also, the community volunteers did not find sex a factor that influenced utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV after the advent of COVID-19. Our findings revealed that adults aged 25–39 (aOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26–0.66) were less likely to utilize viral load monitoring compared to young people aged 20–24 as reported in Table  Our study findings revealed that, adults aged 25–39 (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.20–0.47) were less likely to utilize TB preventative therapy compared to young people aged 20–24 as reported in Table  Our findings revealed that adults aged 25–39 (aOR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22–0.46) were less likely to utilize TB screening compared to young people aged 20–24 as reported in Table  In the qualitative findings, 50% of community volunteers felt that opportunistic infections such as TB that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic period were also an important factor in pushing less people living with HIV to access HIV services as their health facilities were nursing COVID-19 patients. Hence with in this instance opportunistic infection became a push factor to ensure HIV services are utilised as noted by the community volunteers. The study was conducted to explore the predictors of continued utilization of HIV care and treatment services since the COVID-19 outbreak among people living with HIV on ART in Zimbabwe. Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak effects on utilization of HIV care and treatment services, the study found that 7% people living with HIV who were part of the study had interruptions in accessing their ART refills. In terms of accessing routine viral load monitoring, 10% of the people living with HIV reported an interruption. Moreover, 14% of the people living with HIV eligible for TB preventative therapy also reported an interruption in accessing the service. Routine TB screening had the highest proportion of interruptions at 25%. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were noted as the main reason for not accessing services as expected during the COVID-19 curtailing measures. Concerning the predictors for utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19, in multivariate analysis, some categories of age, marital status, religion, COVID-19 vaccination, opportunistic infections, residence, type of facility, and fear of contracting COVID-19 had a significant likelihood for HIV services utilization at the advent of COVID-19.Our study found that study participants could not meet their clinical appointments to get ART refills at the advent of COVID-19 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The finding that COVID-19 was a barrier to visiting health facilities for ART refills was consistent with what was found in studies conducted in different countries and regions [ Our findings revealed that residence was an important factor in defining utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19. This result was also similar to a study in Rwanda, which found residence significant in the access to ART refills [ The study has established that COVID-19 restrictions impacted utilization of HIV care and treatment services among people living with HIV in Zimbabwe. We found that age, marital status, religion, education, being vaccinated for COVID-19, opportunistic infections, residence, type of health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, and non-availability of community health services were significantly associated with utilization of one or more HIV services. There is now more than ever a greater focus on the global effort to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic through achieving epidemic control. There is thus a need to ensure that there is access to and uptake of HIV treatment services for all populations across ages, genders, religions, and localities, including those who are vulnerable despite the challenges proffered by new disease emergencies. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care has affirmed its commitment to epidemic control in the country. It is thus imperative that the implications of COVID-19 on HIV care and treatment that were investigated provide useful information on utilization predictors in times of intersecting epidemics and that the HIV response also needs tightening in the last mile of achieving epidemic control. Future studies may need to integrate how emerging predictors such as mental health among people living with HIV weigh in on the utilization of HIV services, particularly in emergencies such as COVID-19.","['HIV', 'COVID-19', 'Public health', 'Zimbabwe']",2023-10-20,AIDS and Behavior,HIV

11469954,Mapping Evaluation Use: A Scoping Review of Extant Literature (2005–2022),"Factors influencing evaluation use has been a primary concern for evaluators. However, little is known about the current conceptualizations of evaluation use including what counts as use, what efforts encourage use, and how to measure use. This article identifies enablers and constraints to evaluation use based on a scoping review of literature published since 2009 (","Evaluations and their use are essential for generating evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of programs and policies. Evaluations typically involve data-informed processes that culminate in results that are shared in formal and informal ways to improve programs and decision-making ( Evaluation use and utilization are not defined consistently and are often used interchangeably.  Terminology is enmeshed in the dialogue about evaluation use ( Over the last three decades, evaluation has shifted from traditional goals, such as producing reports for funders and decision-makers, toward more involved and iterative processes (e.g., collaborative approaches to evaluation [ In this article, we describe the results of our scoping review, which builds on previous reviews ( This article extends the recent work of evaluation scholars who compiled theoretical issues regarding evaluation use ( To guide our scoping review, we used the methodological framework developed by  Procedural description of the five stages of our scoping review. We began this review in 2021 but were slowed by the pandemic; therefore, the authors conducted a more recent search in June 2022. The goal of this review is meta-aggregative, meaning we sought not to reinterpret the examined articles but to describe the sample by generating descriptive statistics, reliably summarizing the key factors found to influence evaluation use, and coalescing the reported implications for theory, practice, and future research, as originally outlined by the authors included in the review. This article is one of five scoping reviews undertaken by an interdisciplinary and intersectoral Evaluation Capacity Network (ECN;  Our review was guided by this question: What factors emerge from the current extant literature on evaluation use that can positively influence use with diverse stakeholders and inform implications for theory, research, and practice in the field of evaluation? To operationalize this broad question and guide this review, the authors developed four research questions:
 What are the characteristics of the extant literature on evaluation use (geographical origin, types of articles, contexts, methods used in empirical work, sectors/disciplines)? What terminology and definitions are being used for evaluation use? What empirical studies exist and what factors arise from that work that influence the use of evaluation findings in different contexts? What implications emerge from the extant literature in the following three areas: theoretical implications, practical implications for evaluators, and implications for future research on evaluation use across diverse stakeholders? The ECN and a research librarian worked with the authors to develop a protocol to guide study selection, eligibility criteria, data extraction, and data analysis.

 Working with a research librarian, three researchers (Reed, Searle, Hughes & Worthington) screened the studies using Covidence ( Using the extracted data, the authors created categories using a cloud-based spreadsheet ( The researchers divided the 47 articles into three categories for further analysis: empirical articles ( The search of databases and evaluation journals returned 2,318 articles. The first screening resulted in 234 full-text articles, which were assessed for eligibility. The second screening identified 47 articles for a full-text review, as reported in  PRISMA diagram of scoping review identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. From the 47 articles reviewed, 28 unique terms emerged to describe evaluation use ( Prevalence of Terms Used to Conceptualize Evaluation Use. Some articles used a unique cluster of terminology not found in other articles. Percentages will not add to 100 as each term created unique total and percentage of analysis was based on that specific total rather than across the full data set. Across the sample, 17 articles (36.2%) provided definitions for their chosen term(s). Although the 47 articles employed various terms, 29 articles (68.1%) employed the term “use” (see  Sample Definitions for the Three Most Common “Use” Terms in Articles. Two-thirds of articles ( A full set of characteristics of the articles included in this review are represented in  Keeping in mind our overall goal of generating a broad understanding of the field of evaluation-use literature in the last 17 years (2005–2022), we noted that theoretical articles featured a wide variety of topics related to evaluation use. Specifically, these articles explored terminology ( Of the empirical articles, qualitative methodologies ( We excluded review articles ( The research reported here provides a review of the factors that were present in the empirical literature published between 2005 and 2022. Although previous research has examined the methodological rigor of research on evaluation (e.g.,  The empirical studies discussed numerous factors that influence evaluation use. While these factors are presented separately, there is considerable overlap and influence on each. For example, the role of stakeholders’ features throughout each of these factors in terms of how that role relates to use, but it is also a standalone factor. Most of these factors are related to the evaluation context and had the power to either enable or constrain evaluation use. Five categories of factors emerged: resources, stakeholder characteristics, evaluation characteristics, social and political environment, and evaluator characteristics (see  Five categories of factors influencing evaluation use. Limited resources are an oft-cited challenge affecting evaluation inquiries and their use. This factor emerged in three articles ( Numerous articles mentioned the stakeholder qualities that impacted the level of evaluation use. Use was affected, for example, when stakeholders already had opinions about the program and evaluation ( Increased evaluation literacy among evaluation users ( The characteristics of the evaluation were a recurring thread across our sample. Evaluation management affected evaluation use ( Evaluation quality and methodological choice matter ( Other factors reducing evaluation use included stakeholders’ perceptions of bias ( Some articles suggest that the social and political contexts of the evaluand are more important to facilitating use than core evaluation activities ( Evaluators themselves influence the level of use. Underlining every evaluation are the evaluator's interpersonal skills ( As discussed above, stakeholders have varying needs related to evaluation literacy ( Use appears to be highest when trusting partnerships exist ( Evaluators who view themselves more as facilitators than experts and who believe in the importance of stakeholder engagement tend to see more evaluation use ( Many articles included in our review shared implications, which we have synthesized into three broad areas: practical implications, theoretical implications, and suggestions for future research. Each of these areas is discussed to point toward opportunities for thinking about evaluation use and utilization. Sixteen articles ( Another practical suggestion focused on incorporating active sessions with stakeholders to increase evaluation literacy and the collaborative interpretation of findings ( Thirteen articles shared theoretical implications ( In most articles, the researchers report the importance of familiarizing oneself with the program background, evaluation context, and social complexities surrounding the inquiry ( Fourteen articles shared avenues for future inquiry ( To keep pace with practice evolutions evaluation, use an important area for evaluators and evaluation scholars to investigate ( Previous reviews recognize evaluation use and utilization as dynamic and interrelated concepts ( The vast possibilities for evaluation practice and theory means that promoting evaluation use and utilization can involve many stakeholders, take many forms, and happen in many ways. Our review shows that promoting use requires paying attention to stakeholders as well as understanding the evaluation situation. This in turn aligns with an established practice of developing relationships that encourage responsive stakeholder engagement appropriate for context ( While the field of evaluation defines stakeholders as those who are invested, our review specifies those stakeholders representing only a small sample of possible stakeholders. This limited perspective is surprising, given what we know about both the potential to engage stakeholders ( Stakeholders is a noteworthy concept, which appears in all five factors identified in this review in addition to being featured as its own factor. Another factor, resources was established as the first factor also underpinning other factors, as resource limitations influence decision-making and was explicitly stated in a few studies ( The factor evaluation characteristic aligns with findings from prior reviews which demonstrates that the quality of the evaluation continues to matter; studies show that an evaluation must be high quality—and perceived as high quality—to facilitate use. Quality is determined through a multifaceted approach that considers the evaluation's design, management, and reporting ( Positioning an evaluator as a facilitator who is aware of and attentive to the social and political landscape ( Emphasizing cultural competence relates to the factors identified in this review through the need for responsiveness to people and programs. This focus is likely to be amplified in future research to enhance understanding about evaluation use and utilization. Future scholarship points to the need for development of more complex theories of evaluation use. Such theories could help the field to better understand and predict the impacts of stakeholder traits, reporting styles, social relationships, and participatory processes on evaluation use ( Many evaluators embrace their roles as capacity builders, innovators, and change-makers who work alongside social champions to address complex challenges and use evidence for decision-making. Advancing useful evaluation in ways that promote inclusivity, equity, and fairness is an important aspect of evaluators’ theoretical and applied practice ( Our use of a five-stage process ( Supplemental material, sj-docx-1-aje-10.1177_10982140241234841 for Mapping Evaluation Use: A Scoping Review of Extant Literature (2005–2022) by Michelle Searle, Amanda Cooper, Paisley Worthington, Jennifer Hughes, Rebecca Gokiert and Cheryl Poth in American Journal of Evaluation Supplemental material, sj-docx-2-aje-10.1177_10982140241234841 for Mapping Evaluation Use: A Scoping Review of Extant Literature (2005–2022) by Michelle Searle, Amanda Cooper, Paisley Worthington, Jennifer Hughes, Rebecca Gokiert and Cheryl Poth in American Journal of Evaluation","['evaluation use', 'research synthesis', 'evaluation practice', 'theory-practice relationship']",2024-3-13,The American Journal of Evaluation,HIV
11469939,Efficacy of Azvudine Therapy in Patients with Severe and Non-Severe COVID‐19: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"Azvudine is used to treat patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of azvudine in hospitalized patients with different severities of COVID-19 because few studies have described this in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. This retrospective study included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital between December 2022 and January 2023. Azvudine-treated patients and controls were matched for sex, age, and disease severity at admission. Laboratory results and outcomes, including all-cause mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and hospital stay length, were evaluated. Stratified analysis was used to explore the difference in the efficacy of azvudine in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. No significant differences in all-cause mortality were observed between the 303 azvudine recipients and 303 matched controls. However, azvudine-treated patients had shorter hospital stays (8.34±4.79 vs 9.17±6.25 days, P=0.046) and higher lymphocyte improvement rates (21.5% vs 13.9%, P=0.019), with a more pronounced effect in patients with non-severe COVID-19 (length of hospital stay, 8.07±4.35 vs 10.00±6.29 days, P=0.001; lymphocyte improvement rate, 23.8% vs 12.8%, P=0.015). Azvudine treatment shortens hospital stay length and increases the rate of lymphocyte count improvement in patients with non-severe COVID-19, suggesting that azvudine may be a treatment option for these patients.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to threaten global public health and generate a considerable economic burden. Azvudine is a broad-spectrum, small nucleoside analog inhibitor originally developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Based on the available evidence for azvudine used in COVID-19 treatment, compared to controls, azvudine could reduce the viral load and shorten the time to negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of azvudine in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, including all-cause mortality, the rate of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and lymphocyte improvement rate. Stratified by COVID-19 severity, this study assessed the efficacy of azvudine in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Our findings provide valuable clinical evidence to support physicians in using azvudine therapy in patients with different COVID-19 severities. We conducted a retrospective study of hospitalized patients with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid at Guizhou Provincial People’s Hospital. The enrollment period spanned from December 10, 2022 to January 10, 2023. All participants were administered azvudine plus standard treatment or standard treatment alone. The treatment protocol was based on the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version, 10). The severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version, 10). The severe group included severe and critical COVID-19 cases, whereas the non-severe group included mild and common cases. Electronic medical records and laboratory results of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 were retrieved from the hospital information system. The data included demographic information (age and sex), comorbidities, medication history, vital signs, diagnoses, prescriptions, and outcome records. We also reviewed laboratory results at admission and after treatment. The improvement rate of the laboratory indicators was defined as the proportion of patients with abnormal levels at admission that returned to normal levels after treatment. Treatment decisions for patients with COVID-19 were made by physicians based on clinical features and guidelines. Patients with COVID-19 who received oral azvudine during hospitalization were defined as those exposed to treatment. Azvudine was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg once daily for less than 14 days. Controls were patients with COVID-19 who had received neither azvudine nor other antiviral drugs during hospitalization. The patients were also provided other standard treatments, such as prone ventilation, anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, nutritional support, and oxygen therapy, as appropriate. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and length of hospital stay. We reviewed the outcomes from the admission date, outcome events, and discharge or death date. We compared the outcomes between the azvudine and control groups among all included patients with COVID-19, patients with severe COVID-19, and patients with non-severe COVID-19. Multiple imputations were used to handle missing data. Medians and interquartile ranges were calculated for continuous variables and compared using a  Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the association between azvudine use and all-cause mortality. In addition, inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to perform sensitivity analyses. Individual propensities for receiving azvudine treatment were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model that included the same covariates as those used in the Cox regression model to calculate the stabilized IPW weight. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox models using IPW weights are reported. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to obtain 95% pointwise confidence intervals for the IPW Kaplan–Meier curves. Stratified analysis was used to explore the differences in the efficacy of azvudine in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Statistical significance was set at p <0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 4.2.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We consecutively collected data of 1126 hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 between December 10, 2022 and January 10, 2023. A total of 778 patients were eligible for inclusion. Ultimately, 303 patients were included in the azvudine group (median treatment duration, 5 days) and 475 in the control group ( Baseline Characteristics of Patients Receiving or Not Receiving Azvudine Before and After Propensity Score Matching Flow chart of patients screening. In the matched cohort, the all-cause mortality rate was 16.2% in the azvudine group and 12.2% in the control group, showing no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.200). Likewise, in the multivariate, IPW, and PSM analyses, azvudine was not superior to the control treatment with respect to all-cause mortality ( Clinical Outcomes Among Azvudine Recipients versus Matched Controls Kaplan-Meier charts showing all-cause mortality using probability weighting analysis in all patients ( Among the laboratory outcomes, the improvement rates of leukocyte and neutrophil counts were similar between the two groups ( Comparison of the improvement rate of leukocytes ( Of the 778 enrolled patients, 475 were considered to have non-severe COVID-19, and 303 were considered to have severe COVID-19 at admission. Among the non-severe COVID-19 cohort, 165 were treated with azvudine, and 310 were not.  Among the matched patients with non-severe COVID-19, the all-cause mortality rate was 4.3% in the azvudine group and 3.0% in the control group, with no significant difference between the two groups ( Of the 303 patients with severe COVID-19, 138 were treated with azvudine, and 165 were in the control group. The baseline characteristics of the patients with severe COVID-19 before and after PSM are presented in  In terms of clinical outcomes, no significant differences were observed in the all-cause mortality, intubation rate, or ICU admission between the azvudine and control groups ( This was a retrospective study on the efficacy of azvudine in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. After PSM, the study included 303 azvudine recipients and 303 controls. We found that azvudine administration was associated with a shorter hospital stay and a higher improvement rate of lymphocyte count without impairing liver and kidney function, particularly in patients with non-severe COVID-19. In this cohort, for patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19, the azvudine group had a similar all-cause mortality rate to that of the control group. Consistent with our findings, Sun et al In this study, azvudine-treated patients, particularly those with non-severe COVID-19, had significantly shorter length of hospital stay than patients in the control group. These findings are consistent with recent reports that azvudine treatment is associated with a shorter hospital stay (7.00±1.41 vs 13.00±4.30 days, P=0.02). Lymphopenia is an important laboratory abnormality caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our study, the duration of azvudine treatment varied from 5 to 14 days. Since azvudine was approved on an emergency basis during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence on its optimal treatment course is limited. The current instructions only recommend the use of azvudine for the treatment of COVID-19 for no more than 14 days. A recent study evaluating the relationship between azvudine treatment duration and efficacy found that azvudine administration for at least 7 days could reduce the rate of 28-day disease progression of COVID-19. In terms of safety, we found no significant differences in liver and renal function between the azvudine-treated and control groups. Consistent with our findings, Shang et al This study had several limitations. First, although this study used PSM to adjust for major confounders, it was impossible to exclude all confounding factors because of its retrospective design. Second, although we assessed in-hospital mortality, the short follow-up period did not allow us to adequately investigate the effect of azvudine on mortality. Third, this was a single-center study that may have led to a data bias. In our analysis of patients with COVID-19, azvudine treatment shortened the length of hospital stay and increased the rate of lymphocyte improvement. This effect was more pronounced in patients with non-severe COVID-19. No drug-related liver or kidney function impairments were observed in the patients with COVID-19 that were treated with azvudine. Taken together, our findings support the use of azvudine in patients with non-severe COVID-19.","['azvudine', 'COVID-19', 'severity', 'effectiveness', 'clinical outcome', 'hospital stay length']",2024-10-07,Infection and Drug Resistance,HIV
11469720,Determining Predictive Power of Base Excess in Comparison with SOFA Score for Predicting Mortality in ICU Patients,"Acid-base disturbances are frequently found in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Base excess (BE) is commonly used to quantify the degree of metabolic impairment. We aimed to compare the predictive value of BE and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for mortality in ICU patients.  This prospective and observational investigation was performed on 87 ICU patients who underwent mechanical ventilation. SOFA score and acid-base variables at 6 hours of ICU admission were analyzed and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to analyze the predictive value of BE and SOFA for mortality.  Mean age of patients was 63.91±5.03 years, and 60 (69%) were male. The non-survived patients had significantly higher SOFA (  BE is, to some extent capable of predicting mortality in ICU patients. However, the SOFA score is a more accurate and reliable parameter in comparison to BE for prediction.","The SOFA score is widely used in the daily monitoring of acute morbidity and predicting short-term mortality in ICU patients. Also, acid-base status has been considered as a parameter for mortality prediction in different subgroups of ICU patients BE could predict mortality in ICU patients to some extent. However, the SOFA score is a more accurate and reliable parameter for predicting mortality in ICU Mortality prediction in hospitalized patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary for planning treatment approaches, making decisions, and also for support and advice to the patient’s family ( The SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score is widely used in the daily monitoring of acute morbidity to measure organ dysfunction/failure over time and predict short-term mortality in patients admitted to the ICUs (  This prospective and observational study was carried out on 87 ICU patients who underwent mechanical ventilation. The protocol of investigation was reviewed and approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (IR.IUMS.FMD.REC.1399.568), and written informed consent was obtained from participants.Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years and patients with at least 5 days of ICU stay. Patients with hypercalcemia (blood Ca >10.8 mg/dL), cirrhosis, HIV or HCV infection, kidney dialysis, and those who were hospitalized in ICU for postoperative care were excluded from the study. All participants were followed until discharge from the ICU or death, whichever happened earlier for measuring clinical outcomes. The required sample was 87 patients based on a type I error of 10%, power of 96%, and 65.4% mortality in the Samanta et al. study ( All included patients were mechanically ventilated by admission to the ICU and received intravenous propofol at the dose of 25-50 μg/kg/min for sedation under a ventilator machine. SOFA score was determined and arterial blood gas (ABG) was analyzed in a varied blood gas analyzer (Techno Medica, GASTAT 700 series, Yokohama, Japan) to determine pH, PaCO Continuous data was compared by student’s t-test, and categorical data was analyzed by Fisher's exact test between survivors and non-survivors. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to analyze the predictive value of BE and SOFA for mortality in ICU patients. Potential confounding variables were age, gender, and ABG parameters since they influenced the outcome. Results with  From a total of 87 patients, 60 (69%) were male, and the mean age of patients was 63.91±5.03 years. The most frequent illnesses for which patients were admitted to ICU were respiratory disease (31%) and heart failure (24%) followed by renal failure (17%), coagulopathy (15%), and liver disease (13%). Finally, 15 patients (17%) died and 72 patients (83%) survived and were transferred from ICU to general ward.

The present study evaluated the predictive value of BE at 6 hours of admission for mortality in ICU patients. About 80% of non-survived patients had metabolic acidosis (BE < -2). However, the BE value was not superior to SOFA for the prediction of mortality in ICU patients (ROC-AUC of 71% vs 83%). Numerous clinical investigations have used a variety of tools, including SOFA, APACHE II, and ABG parameters, for the prediction of mortality and identification of patients at risk of deterioration ( Our investigation is limited by the single-center design and small sample size of participants. Moreover, ABG errors during blood sample withdrawal, collection, transportation, and analysis were not considered in this study. This study also evaluated only the baseline BE value; hence, we could not assess the influence of dynamic changes in the BE parameter on the survival endpoint.

11469712,Age-Adjusted in-Hospital Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Infection: Impact of the Presence of Multiple Comorbidities,"Mortality has been indicated to be high in patients with underlying diseases. This study aimed to examine the comorbidities is associated with a higher risk of death during the hospital course.   We retrospectively evaluated the risk of in-hospital death in 1368 patients with COVID-19 admitted to 5 academic hospitals in Tehran between February 20 and June 13, 2020. We also assessed the composite end-point of intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and death. The Cox proportional survival model determined the potential comorbidities associated with deaths and serious outcomes.   The retrospective follow-up of patients with COVID-19 over 5 months indicated 280 in-hospital deaths. Patients with diabetes (risk ratio (RR), 1.47 (95% CI, 1.10-1.95);   Having ≥ 2 comorbidities in nonelderly patients is associated with a greater risk of death during hospitalization. To reduce the mortality of COVID-19 infection, younger patients with underlying diseases should be the focus of attention for prevention strategies.","Several studies demonstrated that comorbidities are associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection This study indicated that having ≥2 comorbidities is associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients ˂65 years old The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, presenting with heterogeneous clinical manifestations (  This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 5 academic hospitals (Firouzabadi, Firouzgar, Haftetir, Rasouleakram, and Yaftabad) affiliated with Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) in Iran. These are public general hospitals actively involved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the IUMS (ethic code: IR.IUMS.REC.1399.066). The necessity for informed consent was removed regarding the minimal-risk research using data collected in ordinary clinical practice. We registered all hospitalized patients with verified COVID-19 admitted between February 20, 2020, and June 13, 2020. Those with a positive polymerase chain reaction test result from a nasopharyngeal specimen were deemed to have COVID-19. Those without laboratory reports for COVID-19 who showed the clinical indications of COVID-19 along with typical chest computed tomography (CT) findings were also regarded as having COVID-19. For patients with a readmission through the study period, data from the first admission are conferred.  Medical certificates of all confirmed patients involving demographic data, baseline comorbidities, chest CT findings, smoking status, vital signs at the time of admission, along with hospital course data containing treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, duration of hospitalization, and patient situation at the time of discharge (alive or dead) were gathered. Comorbidities were identified by history and related medication. Data were extracted from patients' hospital documents during admission. All clinical profiles from 5 academic hospitals were centrally combined. The data were entered into a computerized database for further double-checking of all cases by some experienced technicians.  Comorbidities were defined based on patients’ self-reports on admission. A total of 8 comorbidities, namely HTN, DM, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), lung diseases, including asthma and COPD, cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), heart failure (HF), and malignancy consisted of the final analysis. Comorbidities were first recognized as a categorical variable (yes versus no) and subsequently ordered according to the number (single versus multiple). Treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and death were the initial consequences of this study, calculated independently and as a complex reaction. All clinical outcomes are performed for patients who finished their hospital course (discharged alive or dead).  The categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages, while the continuous variables are represented as the median and interquartile ranges (IQR). To determine the effect of each of the 8 considered comorbidities on the incidence of either of the response variables, namely ICU admission, death, the composite outcome, and invasive mechanical ventilation, the arranged risk ratios were measured, employing the method proposed by Norton et al (2013), adapted for sex, age, duration of hospitalization, and the other comorbidities ( Finally, a survival analysis was accomplished to determine the death probability from the hospital admission date. For this purpose, the Kaplan-Meyer survival curve was distinctly for the patients with 0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3 comorbidities, and the Log-rank test evaluated the difference between these categories. Then, the Cox proportional hazard survival models were adjusted at the time of hospitalization to get the hazard ratios of death between those with and without any of the 8 discussed comorbidities. These models were regulated for sex, age, and other comorbidities. Statistical analyses were operated by applying Stata software Version 13. The significant level was set at   This multicenter retrospective cohort study comprised 1368 (59.9% men) hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a median age of 58 years (IQR, 43-70). Comorbidity was registered for 1235 patients, of whom 633 (51.3%) reported having at least 1 comorbidity—26.6% one comorbidity, 15.1% two comorbidities, and 9.6% more than 2 comorbidities. The popularity of special comorbidities was as follows: DM (n = 362; 26.5%), HTN (n = 359; 26.2%), CAD (n = 99; 7.2%), HF (n = 44; 3.2%), CVA (n = 40; 2.9%), CKD (n = 67; 43, 3.1%), chronic liver disease (n = 14; 1%), Tuberculosis (TB) (n = 9; 0.7%), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n = 3; 0.2%).

Patients with CKD, HF, DM, malignancy, and lung diseases typically had greater risks of getting to the composite end-point invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or death. Moreover, those with CKD and DM had an undoubtedly expanded risk of death through the hospital course. Regarding the number of comorbidities, having ≥2 comorbidities intensified mortality risk in patients ˂65 years during hospitalization.  The most widespread comorbidities in this extended cohort of COVID-19 patients were HTN, DM, and CAD. These comorbidities are considered the most prevalent underlying diseases in studies with various sample sizes organized in different populations ( Similar to the previous research ( Survival analysis presented that CKD and DM considerably raised the hazard of death through the hospital course. Previous research not only showed that DM is linked to an increased risk of death ( Although the coexistence of various basic diseases has been generally recorded in the cohorts of COVID-19- patients ( This was, to our knowledge, the first multicenter cohort study on Iranians with COVID-19 that looked into the connection between a variety of comorbidities and a complicated hospital stay. In addition, data on comorbidities were accessible for ˃90% of the admitted patients. However, this study has certain limitations. First, random sampling could not be applied in our study as a result of the necessity of data extraction. Second, comorbidities were self-reporting. Underreporting of comorbidities because of lack of awareness or diagnostic testing might distract the intensity of their corporation with the clinical results. In this cohort of Iranian people with COVID-19, the presence of malignancy, DM, HF, CKD, and lung disease were prognosticator of a complicated hospital course. CKD and DM were also risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, the risk of death was more than twice as high for patients 65 years of age or older with at least two comorbidities.  N/A.

11469703,Subjective Valuation of Screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Analysis of its Influencing Factors: Evidence from Iran,"Spinal muscular atrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that typically leads to severe physical disability. The present study aimed to determine the subjective evaluation of this disorder screening and analyze its influencing factors in Iran.  A cross-sectional study was performed using data from the second survey of women either pregnant or planning to become pregnant in Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 2022. The dependent variable was the willingness to pay for this disease screening test. The independent variables included sociodemographic, economic, and health characteristics, the history of this disease or other diseases of the person and family, and knowledge about this disease in the included population. Logistic regression was utilized to identify independent variables associated with the dependent variable, and the results were reported as unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and P values with 95% CIs. A questionnaire was used as a research tool, and STATA 17 software was used for data analysis. The monetary value of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) screening was calculated by estimating willingness to pay using the congenital valuation method.   In total, 578 women were included. About 64.85% of respondents had a willingness to pay for SMA screening as the dependent variable, with a mean of $526. University education (  Iranian women expressed their willingness to undergo screening tests, but due to financial constraints, they expected the government and nongovernmental organizations to bear most of the cost.","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary neurological disease that usually leads to severe physical disability and has dire consequences on the health of patients and their families This study is the first to examine the subjective value of willingness to pay (WTP) for the SMA screening carrier test and its related factors in Iran. More than half of the respondents stated that they would be willing to pay out-of-pocket for an SMA screening test Among the motor neuron diseases, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common ones ( This disease is a prevalent issue in various regions of the world. In 2017, in a study on the prevalence of SMA, the global average was about 8 children with this disease per 100,000 births, with a variation between 5 and 24 children ( Type 1 is the most common type of SMA in most countries, including Iran, where precise epidemiological information is not available because infants with this type of SMA usually do not survive the first 2 years of life. In addition, accurate disease diagnosis and recording of SMA cases and deaths are complex ( There are 2 screening methods for SMA—carrier and newborn. Carrier screening is one of the fastest ways to diagnose SMA before or during pregnancy ( Considering the high cost of SMA treatment drugs and the resulting physical and mental difficulties on the patient and their families, as well as the absence of universal screening for this disease in Iran due to its risks and aggravating factors such as the prevalence of family marriages in some regions of the country and the lack of simultaneous genetic tests and counseling in this case before marriage, it seems that it is necessary to conduct research in the field of valuing the willingness to pay for the screening of this disease. Therefore, this study is the first in Iran on the subjective evaluation of SMA screening by estimating willingness to pay (WTP—the maximum price the consumer is willing to pay for a particular product or service—and analyzing its influencing factors (  This study was conducted as a cross-sectional population-based survey from September 23, 2022, to January 20, 2023, in specialized clinics and obstetrics and gynecology hospitals in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The study population included women who were pregnant or trying to conceive (N = 578). The questionnaire was randomly delivered to anyone who could answer anonymously. The sample size was defined according to Pourhoseingholi et al and Mitchell and Carson (  This study used a convenient sampling method that helps establish a potential hypothesis or study objective. This strategy is common in demographic research. One advantage of this type of sampling is that it is simple, affordable, and time-efficient ( The monetary value of SMA screening was calculated by estimating WTP using the congenital valuation method (CVM). This method has been confirmed in various scientific sources (  After reviewing the questionnaires of different studies—Donaldson et al ( At the start of the questionnaire, an introduction was given about the purpose of the research, the necessity of its implementation, and the obligation to keep the data confidential. Then, 40 questions were asked about the factors as independent variables in different dimensions as follows:  This included age, ethnicity, kinship relationship with the spouse, university education status, university education related to health care, occupation status, occupation in the health care system, monthly family income, and the status of basic and supplementary insurance coverage. This included the health status of children and pregnancy experience, history of SMA, and other genetic and nongenetic disorders such as diabetes and blood pressure in the individual and the family, as well as the history of SMA screening and other diseases, which were carried out by the respondent. The questionnaire included a question about the respondent's familiarity with SMA.  All factors, except for age and monthly income, were inquired through closed-ended questions with 2 options of ""yes"" or ""no"" Respondents were given 5 options for the monthly income factor: ˂$90, $97 to $194, $194 to $258, $258 to $316, and ˃$316, and the respondents were required to select an option that best described their family's monthly income. Subjective valuation of the SMA screening test by WTP was determined using the CVM. Using a survey design, we presented a hypothetical scenario consisting of general and specific information about SMA, and the carrier screening test for this disease was given to the study population, and the participants assuming out-of-pocket payment were asked for their maximum WTP for the screening test. The designed SMA screening scenario focused on the following points:  • General and specialized information about SMA and its different types. • Guidance on implementing a carrier screening program to enable early diagnosis of SMA and an overview of its strengths and weaknesses. • Information about drug therapy options for the treatment of SMA, including their limited availability and high cost, as well as their potential to reduce the risk of death and improve the condition of patients.  After reading the scenario, female respondents were asked a closed-ended question regarding their WTP for the SMA carrier screening test. They had to choose one of the options: ""agree,"" ""disagree,"" or ""do not know."" If they selected ""agree,"" they had to select an exact price out of 14 suggested values, ranging from ˂$15.8 to ˃$4424 (  The study used the minimum wage law of Iran's Ministry of Cooperation, Labor, and Social Welfare as the income distribution index. If respondents were unwilling to pay, the reasons for their decision were presented as closed questions with 5 options to choose from: ""I do not believe in screening for diseases to detect them faster,"" ""I do not believe in SMA screening,"" ""Can diagnose the disease faster,"" ""I cannot afford it,"" and ""Other reasons."" They had to select 1 or more reasons for their unwillingness to pay.   In the first survey, 74 eligible women were asked an open-ended question about how much they would be willing to pay for an SMA carrier screening test ( An expert panel also validated the questionnaire. Finally, a questionnaire was prepared for the respondents in the second survey to collect the actual WTP prices.  In this study, we converted the monetary amounts of WTP according to the International Monetary Fund data for purchasing power parity values in USD in the study year. Accordingly, each US dollar is equivalent to 31,645 Iranian rials, the information of which is extracted from the ""CCEMG–EPPI Centre Cost Converter"" ( During the COVID-19 pandemic, the questionnaires in the first survey were designed as an internet panel. They were distributed to respondents through email and social networks like Telegram and WhatsApp. However, with the subsidence of the epidemic, in the second stage of the survey, questionnaires were distributed and gathered in person among the study population.  Descriptive analysis was performed on demographic, economic, health, and other variables to illustrate the characteristics of the study population. The median, mean, standard deviation, first and third quartiles, IQR, and 95% CIs were calculated. The logistic regression model evaluated the relationship between the WTP for the SMA carrier screening test and all independent variables. WTP was categorized as 1 and 0 for participants who agreed and disagreed with WTP. All variables were included in the principal logistic regression model, and variables with  If the equation consists of only 1 independent variable, the UOR considers the influence of that 1 independent variable on the dependent variable. However, when more variables are included in the analysis, the AOR takes into account the effect of a predictor variable on the dependent variable, taking into account all additional variables included in the analysis ( * Mentioning the exact amount The studied population consisted of 578 women. After the study population completed the questionnaires, some needed to complete information about their WTP for SMA screening, and in others, conflicting information was entered. Finally, 569 questionnaires were included in the study and analyzed. 
 Additionally, 34.97% of the working women were part of the health care system. More than 10.9% of women were familiar with SMA, and over 76% had experienced pregnancy. Only 2.07% of women had a history of SMA in their family or relatives, and ˂2% had undergone a personal SMA screening test.  Of the female respondents, 64.85% had chosen ""yes""; in other words, they expressed their WTP screening fees directly out of pocket.  In the 95% CI, the 2 variables of university education (AOR, 0.526;  
 In women's university education variable, AOR was higher than UOR, indicating that the chance of influencing these variables and other independent variables on WTP for screening for this disease was higher than its chance alone on the dependent variable. The variable of pregnancy experience is the same, and AOR was higher than UOR. 
The analysis showed that the WTP for noncollege-educated women is higher than that of college-educated women. Also, women with pregnancy experience had more WTP than women without this experience.  Reasons for unwillingness to pay for SMA screening and the fre-quency of respondents choosing each reason LR chi2(4): 30.24, Prob > chi2: 0.000, Pseudo R2: 0.043, Log likelihood: -339.21 This study is the first to examine the subjective valuation of WTP for the SMA screening test and its related factors in Iran. The study analyzed the WTP benefits of SMA carrier screening and found that about 35% of the women who participated were not willing to pay for the SMA screening test. Logistic regression results showed that university education and pregnancy experience were the main factors associated with WTP for screening tests, while women's age and occupation had a less significant effect. In a similar study conducted by Lin et al ( Considering that more than half of the studied population expressed satisfaction with paying for SMA screening tests, it can be concluded that Iranian women are generally willing to perform them. Their opinion is based on the accepted theory that prevention is preferable to treating any kind of disease and abnormality, including SMA as a congenital genetic abnormality. Of course, we should remember the influential role of the government, private, and nongovernmental organizations in financing and supporting patients with SMA and their families. According to our findings, there are very few studies on WTP for screening and the treatment of this disease. However, there are several studies on the WTP for various intervention screening and treatment in other congenital and rare genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and celiac disease. In the study by Lin et al ( The mean and median WTP of respondents for SMA screening test in this study were $65 and $526, respectively. In a study by Lin et al on parents' WTP for newborn screening tests for early detection of SMA, the mean and median WTP for SMA screening tests without available treatment were $142 and $253, respectively ( According to research by Donaldson et al, the main motivation behind the desire to pay people for cystic fibrosis carrier gene testing was the need for certainty about the test results and to avoid the risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis ( This study investigated and analyzed factors related to WTP for the SMA screening test. University education and pregnancy experience were significantly associated with WTP for the SMA screening test. In general, a college-educated person makes more rational decisions about various issues, including paying out-of-pocket for SMA screening tests, than a noncollege-educated person. Therefore, it can be concluded that those who have attended college spend less on SMA screening than those who have not because the former group does not hold government, private, or nongovernmental organizations and institutions accountable for this expense. Their ability to cover the expenses is well established. Like this study, Norström et al found that education played a significant role in WTP for the screening test for celiac disease in a study on the topic that was carried out in 5 regions of Sweden. The study also found that income was a significant factor in WTP for the screening test ( It was expected that some independent variables, such as income or insurance, would significantly affect the WPT. Still, the nonsignificance of such variables on the desire to pay for spinal muscular atrophy screening can be attributed to the influence of noneconomic factors, such as social and cultural factors attributed to the WTP. Also, this study concluded that women with a history of pregnancy are more willing to pay compared to women without a history of pregnancy. This issue can be justified by the fact that pregnant women suffer from physical, financial, and psychological problems during pregnancy. During this period, they understand the psychological pressure related to the health status of the fetus and the uncertainty of the birth of a healthy baby. Therefore, they are willing to reduce this psychological pressure by spending more money to receive preventive interventions and screening tests to ensure the increase of fetal health and the birth of a healthy baby. This study had some limitations. Since some participants refused to answer some of the questions in the questionnaire, the questionnaire was prepared considering possible bias. Another limitation of this study was the social conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to experts and the study population in the pretest phase, resolved by following health guidelines and developing electronic tools. Also, there is a risk of initial bias in different questionnaire designs using the CVM method, meaning that the base price offered affects consent to pay. Therefore, several prices were presented to the respondents. Considering the willingness of most people in this study to pay for SMA screening tests, it can be concluded that Iranian women are willing to perform SMA screening tests. On the other hand, these people stated that the most important reason for their unwillingness to pay is their lack of financial ability or their belief that they are not responsible for the screening cost for this abnormality. Thus, the community members expect the decision-makers, policymakers, and health system trustees, along with the financial and nonfinancial support of the patients and their families, to be aware of the preferences of the people and the monetary valuation of the benefits resulting from prevention interventions, and make decisions based on scientific evidence regarding its targeted performance at diverse levels of the health care system. The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

11469690,Risk Factors Associated with Neonatal Mortality and Their Status: A Matched Case-Control Study in Kurdistan,"Neonatal mortality is a significant public health issue that can often be prevented. The present study was designed and conducted to determine the causes of neonatal mortality and the status of their mothers in Kurdistan Province in 2019.  In this matched case-control study, the case group comprised 171 deceased neonates, while the control group consisted of 171 healthy neonates, along with their mothers' status in Kurdistan Province in 2019. for each case in each city, one control from the same city within the same week of the case's birth was randomly selected. Data were collected using a checklist containing information on the neonates and their mothers. The analysis was performed using STATA 17 software, which involved descriptive tests and analytical tests. These included frequency calculation, chi-square test, conditional logistic regression, and a stepwise backward elimination method for multivariate analysis with (  The results, after matching the odds ratio with a CI 95% using the backward method, showed a significant association between prematurity (OR:15.99, 95%CI:4.38-58.31), complications during pregnancy (OR:8.64, 95% CI:2.80-26.66), weight gain during pregnancy (OR:3.04, 95% CI:1.06-8.70).  The findings of our study suggest a positive association between neonatal mortality and specific maternal and neonatal factors, namely neonatal prematurity, complications during pregnancy, and inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy. Therefore, there is a compelling need to implement effective measures to control these identified risk factors, with the goal of reducing neonatal mortality.","Neonatal mortality refers to the death of a newborn within the first 28 days of life. Scientific evidence shows some risk factors related to neonatal mortality. this study was designed and conducted to determine the causes of neonatal mortality and the status of their mothers This study provided confirmation of the evidence and demonstrated that prematurity is a significant risk factor for neonates, while inappropriate weight gains and pregnancy complications are important maternal risk factors that contribute to increased neonatal mortality Neonatal mortality is a significant global public health issue, referring to the death of neonates in the first 28 days of life. In the first month of life, which is mostly preventable, neonatal mortality accounted for 47% of all deaths in children under five years of age in 2020. In 2020, approximately 2.4 million neonates lost their lives in the first month of life. Neonatal mortality rates have decreased worldwide, from 40 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 18 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020 ( Several factors have been identified as influential in neonatal mortality, including prematurity, low birth weight, asphyxia, infections, congenital abnormalities, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, social determinants of health, such as poverty, inadequate access to healthcare, and inadequate nutrition, are also associated with neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries ( A study showed that maternal diseases such as preeclampsia, hospitalization during pregnancy, and poor antenatal care can lead to neonatal mortality ( Recognizing the significance of identifying factors influencing neonatal mortality and the need to minimize intervention and prevention measures, this matched case-control study was conducted. The objective was to determine the risk factors associated with neonatal mortality and the status of mothers in Kurdistan Province in 2019.  the present study is a matched case-control study based on the variables of birthplace city and time of birth (within the same week of the case's birth) in Kurdistan Province, which aimed to investigate the risk factors for neonatal mortality in the year 2019. To select cases and controls, we initially obtained a comprehensive list of births and deliveries in the year 2019 from the registry system of the Health Deputy of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences. This registry includes a list of all pregnant women and their subsequent births and outcomes. A case was defined as a neonate who died within 28 days after birth. The total number of deceased neonatal cases in that year was 171, all of whom were selected as cases and included in the study. The controls were also selected from the same registry system and matched based on the variables of birthplace city and time of birth. For selecting controls, a list of all surviving neonates was first extracted, and then, for each case in each city, one control from the same city with the same birth week as the case was randomly chosen. Data for this study were collected using a checklist. This checklist was prepared by reviewing the literature to extract all risk factors for neonatal mortality. The checklist included demographic variables, neonatal risk factors, and maternal risk factors for neonatal death. Some of the information on mothers and neonates were obtained from registries and records of pregnancies and births in the healthcare system, including the integrated health record systems, locally known as the “SIB”, the Iranian Maternal and Neonatal Network (IMAN) system and medical records. If necessary, visits to households were made to gather information. Trained healthcare personnel in each city were utilized to record the information in the checklists. in this study, the outcome was neonatal mortality. Cases were selected among neonates who died within 28 days in the year 2019 in Kurdistan Province. The control group in this study consisted of healthy or surviving neonates under 28 days old in the year 2019 in Kurdistan Province. The risk factors under investigation were divided into two categories: neonatal risk factors and maternal risk factors.  
  Prematurity: Defined as being born before 37 weeks of gestation. Respiratory distress Syndrome: Diagnosed by a physician and characterized by respiratory symptoms such as a respiratory rate above 60, grunting, nasal flaring, and retractions, as recorded in the registry or neonatal medical file. Gross anomaly: Referring to structural, anatomical, or functional abnormalities present at birth or diagnosed by a physician before or at the time of birth or during the neonatal period and recorded in the registry or neonate’s medical file. Low birth weight: Defined as a birth weight less than 2500 grams. Neonatal gender: Categorized as girl or boy. 
  Place of residence: Referring to the mother's primary residence at the time of delivery and during pregnancy. Maternal age refers to the mother's age in years at the time of the child's birth. Maternal education refers to the highest educational attainment of the mother at the time of the child's birth. Maternal occupation: Referring to the mother's main occupation. Delivery method: Categorized as natural or cesarean section. History of infertility refers to a history of difficulty conceiving or maintaining a pregnancy for more than 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. Maternal weight gains during pregnancy: Categorized as desirable or undesirable based on the amount of weight gained by the mother during pregnancy. History of abortion: Referring to the termination of pregnancy before the 20th week of gestation. History of stillbirth: Referring to the birth of a nonviable fetus after the 20th week of gestation. Timely making of pregnancy file: Defined as receiving prenatal care either before or after the 12th week of pregnancy. Unwanted pregnancy: Referring to a pregnancy that was not intended or planned. Prenatal care refers to the care provided to pregnant women before and during childbirth. Underlying maternal diseases predispose pregnant women to various underlying diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, congenital heart diseases, and a history of heart attack. It also includes renal diseases such as dialysis and kidney failure, gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, respiratory diseases including asthma, infectious diseases leading to taking medication during pregnancy, diabetes, and other significant diseases that can impact the course of pregnancy and were recorded in the medical files. The mental health status was assessed through mental health screening during the pre-pregnancy period and throughout the pregnancy. For this purpose, a 6-item questionnaire was completed in the initial assessment, including questions about the individual's experience of anxiety, hopelessness, restlessness, depression, difficulty performing tasks, and feelings of worthlessness in the past 30 days. If the score was 10 or higher or if there were 3 ""I don't know"" responses, additional questions about suicidal ideation were asked, including two questions about feeling tired of life and thinking about death and suicide. The healthy or unhealthy mental health status was determined based on this method. The variable "" supplement receiving"" was assessed by measuring the consumption or non-consumption of supplements recommended during pregnancy, including folic acid/iodine, iron, multivitamin-mineral, and vitamin D. This variable was evaluated and measured as either complete receipt, non-receipt, or incomplete receipt, and recorded in the SIB system. The variable ""performance of laboratory tests during pregnancy"" in this study refers to routine tests that the mother undergoes during her pregnancy at two intervals, between weeks 6-10 and weeks 23-30. The tests include CBC (Complete Blood Count), BG (Blood Glucose),  RH (blood type), FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar), U/A (Urine Analysis), BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen), Crea (Creatinine), HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface Antigen), VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory), the first session indirect Coombs test (in Rh-negative mothers after determining the positive status of the partner), TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) if necessary, and HIV. The second round of tests includes CBC, U/A, the second session of indirect Coombs test (in Rh-negative mother with Rh-positive partner), FBS, and OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) for non-diabetic individuals between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy. If any of the mother's test results are not normal, the result is recorded as undesirable. Sonography during pregnancy was performed with the aim of evaluating the fetal status, placental location, and fetal anomalies between weeks 16-18 of pregnancy. Additionally, it is applied during weeks 31 to 34 of gestation. Another fetal screening variable during pregnancy included screening in the first trimester between weeks 11-13 and, if necessary, in the second trimester between weeks 15-17 to assess fetal health. The variable for screening oral and dental problems involved the mother's oral and dental examinations during the first, second, and third visits. The dentist examined and diagnosed the presence of plaque, cavities, gum inflammation, dental infections, and swelling. The variables for the cause of maternal delivery included term delivery, natural pain of delivery, bleeding, Prelabor rupture of membranes, and danger to the mother's health. In this study, two potential confounding variables, the birthplace and birth time of the neonatal, were considered and controlled for as potential confounders. The variable of low birth weight was not included in the model due to collinearity with the variable of prematurity. These variables were recorded in the registry system and other relevant systems. In cases where a variable was not available, it was completed by referring to the pregnancy and delivery records or through interviews with the mother. The collected data underwent analysis utilizing STATA 17 software. Descriptive tests, including frequency calculation and analytical tests, such as chi-square, conditional logistic regression, and a stepwise backward elimination method for multivariate analysis (with   In this case-control study, a total of 342 subjects were examined, consisting of 171 deceased neonates as the case group and 171 healthy neonates as the control group. The demographic variables of the neonatal (case and control), including the gender of the neonatal and prenatal events, are shown in   The chi-square test showed statistically significant differences between the case and control groups in gross anomaly ( Univariate conditional logistic regression results are shown in  Based on the findings of this study, neonatal mortality was found to be associated with various neonatal and maternal factors, such as prematurity, complications during pregnancy, inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy, and laboratory results during pregnancy. The study revealed that prematurity may significantly elevate the risk of neonatal mortality, which is consistent with previous research ( Our findings indicated that unfavorable weight gain during pregnancy may increase the risk of neonatal death. This finding is supported by previous research that has identified maternal weight gain during pregnancy as an important predictor of neonatal outcomes ( Our findings have shown that complications during pregnancy in pregnant mothers may increase the risk of neonatal mortality, which is supported by previous research ( Having a healthy lifestyle and receiving proper healthcare before and during pregnancy can help reduce the risk of complications ( One of the limitations of this study was the lack of access to some data required in the electronic registration system. Although we tried to complete the data by referring to the families of the study participants, in some cases, these data were not available. Also, as with any case-control study that is subject to confounding, we tried to eliminate this confounding in the design by matching and in the analysis by adjusting. However there may be other potential confounding variables that we have not identified. According to our findings, neonatal mortality may be associated with certain maternal and neonatal risk factors, including prematurity, inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy, complications during pregnancy, and abnormal laboratory results during pregnancy. Therefore, it is necessary to control these risk factors in order to reduce neonatal mortality.

Pulmonary, intestinal, bone marrow, and retinal involvement have also been described. Diagnosis of cryptococcal lymphadenitis remains a potential challenge as it can be subclinical with a lack of characteristic clinical and radiological features.  Although many cases of cryptococcal infection worldwide have been reported in other organs, it is sporadic to diagnose cryptococcal infection in lymph nodes by FNAC. The minimally invasive nature of FNAC, coupled with its ability to provide quick results and guide treatment decisions through smears and cultures, makes it a patient-friendly and efficient addition to routine diagnostic practices. Lymph-node FNAC represents a first-line diagnostic option for immunocompromised patients presenting with a wide range of potential diagnoses. This approach holds promise for definitive diagnoses and timely treatment initiation. The definitive diagnosis of this case of cryptococcosis was possible only because of the simple, cost-effective technique of FNAC, which prompted the early initiation of specific and life-saving treatment.","['cerebrospinal fluid (csf)', 'cryptococcus neoformans', 'fine needle aspiration cytology', 'lymphadenitis', 'lymph node']",,Cureus,AIDS

The control and prevention of coccidiosis has relied on anticoccidial drugs and coccidial vaccinations. With the growing consumer demand for poultry products raised without antibiotics (NAE or ABF), the industry has been forced to rely more heavily on coccidiosis vaccination programs ( In the current study, reducing Ca and avP in the diets did not show any significant differences in growth performance before  Reducing Ca and avP in the diet ( Regarding daily FI, an interaction effect between the coccidial vaccine and diets was observed on 7 DPI in the current study. In unvaccinated groups, the NC and NC+25OHD groups had higher FI than the PC group, while in vaccinated groups, the NC and NC+PHY+25OHD diets resulted in lower FI compared to the PC group. This suggests that the vaccine may have influenced the birds' feeding behavior in response to dietary Ca and avP levels. The coccidial vaccine increased FI on 6 DPI but decreased it on 10 DPI, indicating that the vaccine provided immunological protection by stimulating FI during the peak infection but later suppressed it during the recovery phase. Dietary treatments also significantly influenced daily FI. On 9 DPI, the NC diet decreased FI compared to the PC diet, but supplementing phytase or 25OHD, or both, improved FI to a similar level as the PC birds. This result highlights the importance of maintaining adequate dietary Ca and avP levels, or providing supplemental phytase or vitamin D Our current results showed that coccidial vaccine significantly decreased FITC-d levels, suggesting the coccidial vaccine effectively reduced  While we did not observe any difference in intestinal lesion scores between unvaccinated and vaccinated birds in this study, the relationship between lesion scores and the clinical impact of coccidiosis is nuanced ( The differential effect of the coccidial vaccine on oocyst shedding of different  The NC+PHY+25OHD group exhibited an increase in  In addition to improving BW and BWG in broilers post-infection, results from the current study showed that coccidial vaccination also supported the growth of the small intestine during this period. The notable increase in villus height in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, along with the increased VH:CD ratio in the duodenum of vaccinated birds at 6 DPI (d 20), suggests that the coccidial vaccine promotes intestinal health and nutrient absorption by maintaining or enhancing the structure of the intestinal mucosa ( Tight junction proteins play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity in chickens, particularly when birds are under disease conditions. These proteins form the paracellular barrier that regulates the selective permeability of the intestinal epithelium ( In summary, the current study investigated the effects of coccidial vaccination and dietary interventions on growth performance, intestinal health, and tight junction protein expression in broiler chickens challenged with  The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","['phytase', '25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'broiler', 'intestinal health']",2024-9-12,Poultry Science,AIDS
11470725,Application of the world guidelines for falls prevention and management’s risk stratification algorithm to patients on a frailty intervention pathway and the potential utility of sensory impairment information,"The 2022 world guidelines for falls prevention and management suggest measuring sensory function including dizziness, vision, and hearing. These variables are not included in the falls risk stratification algorithm. This study sought to investigate the utility of the guidelines and potential avenues for improvement. This study applied the falls risk stratification recommendations and reviewed the individual sensory impairment risk factor variables predictive of falls and falls risk grouping in those assessed by a frailty intervention team (FIT) based in an emergency department (ED). Patients over 65 years old who attended the ED and had a comprehensive geriatric assessment carried out by FIT over a period of four months were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Patient characteristics, medication, physical and sensory function status data was retrieved and analysed with respect to falls and falls risk grouping. Data was gathered retrospectively from 392 patients. Excluding those with missing data, almost all attendees were in the high-risk of falls category ( Most older adults included in the analysis fell into the low- or high-risk categories, with a minority in the intermediate-risk category. This suggests that the inclusion criteria for the intermediate category could be altered for greater sensitivity. While impaired balance and vision were the most common impairments, hearing status, balance and dizziness were associated with risk group. These results, through a practical application of the world guidelines for falls to an acute clinical sample, raise the possibility of refining the falls risk stratification criteria, and highlight the capacity for additional sensory intervention to mitigate falls risk. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12877-024-05405-3.","A fall is defined as ‘ In the United Kingdom it is estimated that 30% of people aged 65 years or older, will fall at least once a year; and this increases to 50% for those aged over 80 years [ The recently published world guidelines for falls prevention and management [ The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) have recently implemented the framework in an observational study aiming to successfully differentiate those at greater risk of falling [ A Frailty Intervention Team (FIT) was established in October 2020, in the emergency department, at a large level 4 teaching hospital in Dublin’s north inner city. The FIT is an interdisciplinary group consisting of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dietetics, medical social work, pharmacy, nursing, therapy assistants, and medical team members. They complete comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) for older adults, aged 65 years or older, that attend the emergency department. CGAs are completed by all members of the FIT at any stage and/or throughout their attendance at the emergency department. CGAs are utilised as a multidisciplinary diagnostic process to help the FIT identify the medical, psychosocial, and functional needs of older adults. There is strong evidence that in the medical setting, CGAs can guide the development of a coordinated plan to manage the health complexity, and to maximise overall health in older persons [ There is evidence highlighting that sensory issues are linked to an increased risk of falls. Particularly in older adults, hearing loss [ The primary aim of this study was to assess the utility of applying the world guidelines for falls prevention and management stratification algorithm [ The study was a retrospective cross-sectional assessment of patient data over a defined period of time. The primary research questions were: 
 Can the world guidelines for falls prevention and management stratification algorithm be successfully utilised in an emergency department setting? Are sensory variables related to falls and falls risk stratification? What other variables gathered by a CGA could inform the assessment of, and interventions for, falls risk? The authors used a form of convenience sampling. It was decided that a minimum of 200 patients would be needed to give a meaningful insight into the utility of falls guidelines stratification in this observational study. Following an assessment of a random two-week time window of the number of patients who had a CGA carried out, it was established that three months’ worth of data would be adequate accounting for patterns of missing data. Therefore, all patients aged 65 years or older, who attended the emergency department at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and who had a CGA carried out by the FIT between January 3rd and April 20th 2023 were included in the study. Patients younger than 65 years old, and those who attended the emergency department in the specified study period, but did not have a CGA completed by the FIT were excluded. Records were gathered by three of the authors (COC, SM, RK), who are clinicians authorised by the clinical audit and effectiveness committee to access and handle data. In cases where the patient was unable to provide information about their health (e.g., in cases of cognitive impairment), information was gathered from family members and/or carers, as appropriate, or from existing medical records (e.g., previous hearing test results saved on the patient management system). All participant records were pseudonymised before analysis. Sensory function status data was retrieved from a detailed CGA form completed for patients seen. Fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs), as defined by Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions in older adults with high fall risk (STOPPFall) [ The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the clinical audit and effectiveness committee, Quality and Patient Safety Directorate, at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin (Reference number: CA23-011, approved 22/02/2023). The world guidelines for falls prevention and management [ 
 World guideline for falls prevention and management algorithm for risk stratification, assessments and management / interventions for community-dwelling older adults [ The raw data was coded for analysis in the following way: Gender (female = 1, male = 2), History of falls in last 12 months (no = 0, yes = 1), Clinical frailty score [ In total, data was gathered retrospectively from 392 patients, 227 (57.8%) female, and 166 male. The mean age was 82 years old, with a range of 65 to 103 years. In total 134 (34.2%) patients presented at the emergency department with a fall, 255 (65.1%) presented for another reason and three records had missing data for presentation. Over half ( 
 Patient demographics Of those who presented, the majority ( 
 Waffle plot of risk stratification based on world guidelines for falls prevention and management. Low risk falls = less than one fall in past year; Low risk frailty = one fall in past year but no frailty or balance issues; High risk falls = greater than or equal to two falls in the past year; High risk frailty = one fall in the past year and frailty; Intermediate risk = one fall in the past year, balance issue and no frailty; N/A = not able to stratify patient because of missing data The relationships between the sensory variables vision loss, hearing loss, dizziness and balance issues and falls incidence in the past year were individually calculated, controlling for the influence of age, sex, and frailty. Hearing loss was a significant predictor of falls incidence, b = 0.68, z = 2.4,  In the low-risk group, the most common sensory issue was vision loss ( 
 Existence of sensory issues in each of the three risk groups following stratification. Odds ratios (OR) are the odds of being in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group based on having versus not having the sensory issue. The odds ratio for each sensory issue in turn accounts for the effect of age, sex and frailty but not the effect of other sensory issues The CGA gathered information on interventions for hearing loss (hearing aids), vision loss (glasses) and balance issues (mobility aids). The results show that a majority of patients in the high-risk falls group with these sensory issues have already been given interventions. Discounting those for whom there is missing intervention data, in the high-risk falls group 74% of those with hearing loss had a hearing aid, 48% of those with vision loss had glasses and 70% of those with balance issues had mobility aids. There was a large amount of missing data for vision loss in particular (69%). There was missing intervention data of 37% and 1% for hearing and balance respectively. The figures mean there is some limited scope for dealing with untreated sensory problems. (Fig.  
 Number of high-risk patients experiencing vision loss, hearing loss and balance issues who are aided and not aided for the condition Pre-admission medicines reconciliations data was available for 94 participtants in our cohort. In the low-risk group ( The study results showed that the world guidelines for falls prevention and management’s risk stratification algorithm can be successfully utilised in a clinical population, sensory variables hearing loss and dizziness were significantly associated with falls incidence and hearing loss, balance and dizziness were significantly associated with risk grouping. In keeping with the findings of Hartley et al. (2023), who applied the stratification to a non-clinical population [ The study population consisted of older adults who were taken through a frailty screening. Frailty has been connected to the sensory variables of hearing loss [ Sensory interventions, such as hearing aids, have been shown to be related to a reduction in falls amongst older adults [ This study analysed data from 392 patients, however many patients’ CGAs were missing data for one or more variables. This meant that analysis controlling for the effects of other target variables was not possible given the increasingly small numbers of patients with complete data. Future research should analyse larger numbers of patients to assess the comparative impact of the target sensory variable given the presence or non-presence of other sensory impairments. This is also the case for other influential variables such as falls risk inducing medication and polypharmacy. Polypharmacy in particular is linked to a 21% increase in the rate of falls over a two-year period [ The world guidelines for falls prevention and management’s risk stratification algorithm can be utilised clinically, even in a sample of patients on a frailty intervention pathway which was designed before publication of the guidelines. Using the risk stratification algorithm, most of the included patients fell into either the high- or low-risk groups as has been shown in non-clinical populations. Only 4.8% of those stratified were categorised as intermediate risk. This may be accounted for due to the relatively frail nature of the cohort included but is similar to results from a non-clinical sample. Those with hearing impairment, balance issues, and dizziness, independent of frailty, age, and gender, were more likely to be categorised as high risk. This demonstrates the influence of sensory loss in falls risk, highlighting the potential importance of sensory assessment as part of a multi-factorial fall prevention strategy in older adults. Such improvements which utilise sensory impairment information could lead to earlier intervention and better health outcomes. Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

11470719,"Prostate cancer microenvironment: multidimensional regulation of immune cells, vascular system, stromal cells, and microbiota","Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies in males worldwide. Increasing research attention has focused on the PCa microenvironment, which plays a crucial role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key components of the PCa microenvironment, including immune cells, vascular systems, stromal cells, and microbiota, and explore their implications for diagnosis and treatment. Keywords such as “prostate cancer”, “tumor microenvironment”, “immune cells”, “vascular system”, “stromal cells”, and “microbiota” were used for literature retrieval through online databases including PubMed and Web of Science. Studies related to the PCa microenvironment were selected, with a particular focus on those discussing the roles of immune cells, vascular systems, stromal cells, and microbiota in the development, progression, and treatment of PCa. The selection criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles published in the last five years, aiming to summarize and analyze the latest research advancements and clinical relevance regarding the PCa microenvironment. The PCa microenvironment is highly complex and dynamic, with immune cells contributing to immunosuppressive conditions, stromal cells promoting tumor growth, and microbiota potentially affecting androgen metabolism. Vascular systems support angiogenesis, which fosters tumor expansion. Understanding these components offers insight into the mechanisms driving PCa progression and opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment. A deeper understanding of the PCa microenvironment is crucial for advancing diagnostic techniques and developing precision therapies. This review highlights the potential of targeting the microenvironment to improve patient outcomes, emphasizing its significance in the broader context of PCa research and treatment innovation. 
","Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most common cancers in men globally. Global cancer statistics report approximately 1.4 million new cases and 375,000 deaths annually. The incidence of PCa rises significantly in men over 65, severely impacting their health and quality of life [ 
 TME interaction: an ecological perspective on PCa. Single-cell sequencing technology provides a thorough perspective of the PCa microenvironment. The stromal cells, comprising endothelial cells, epithelial cells, pericytes, and CAFs, undergo varying degrees of alterations within the microenvironment of PCa. The M2-macrophages (M2-MФ) subset of macrophages exhibits significant dynamic changes, underscoring the crucial role of immune regulation in this context. Tumor-inflammatory monocytes (TIMo), as one of the monocyte subpopulations, also demonstrates high levels of variation, further highlighting the immune system’s response to PCa. B cells are activated, potentially participating in immune response regulation. However, NK cells activity exhibits a decreasing trend, whereas CTL cells demonstrate significant activity changes, indicating potential distinct roles and regulation of immune cells in responding to PCa The clinical significance of the microenvironment in diagnosing, treating, and predicting the prognosis of PCa is becoming more prominent [ Immune cells in the PCa microenvironment, including T and B lymphocytes, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), play a critical role [ MDSCs are aberrantly activated, immature, and heterogeneous immunosuppressive cells significantly enriched in the PCa microenvironment, impacting PCa development and metastasis [ 
 Immune cells’ dynamic interplay in PCa microenvironment. DCs are the most powerful professional APCs with immunostimulatory properties. Despite impaired cellular phagocytic functions, tumor antigens can still be presented to T cells by DC cells. This process involves handling and presenting tumor antigens to T cells, facilitating T cells recognition. CD4 PCa tissues contain various T lymphocyte subgroups, each with distinct roles and functions in the PCa microenvironment. The study of helper CD4 APCs, including dendritic cells (DCs), TAMs, and B cells, are crucial in the immunoregulation of PCa [ Angiogenesis and PCa interaction are heavily researched topics. Recent studies show a strong link between angiogenesis and PCa [ 
 Vascular networks in PCa: exploring angiogenesis’s impact. The VEGF family comprises various subtypes, including VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and PLGF. VEGF-A binds to TYR kinase receptors, activating signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, thereby promoting angiogenesis. VEGF regulates the activity of TAMs and T lymphocytes, impacting the distribution and function of immune cells within the PCa microenvironment and influencing the immune escape mechanisms of PCa cells. VEGF supplies nutrients and oxygen essential for cancer cells invasion and metastasis, influencing critical processes such as cells adhesion and basement membrane degradation, thereby facilitating the migration and spread of PCa cells. The FGF family mediates cells communication through cells surface receptors, promoting cancer cells proliferation and survival, regulating the expression of cells cycle proteins, and influencing cells mitosis and growth. FGF also contributes to angiogenesis, supplying oxygen and nutrients to cancer cells, thus promoting cancer cells growth and spread. Members of the PDGF family drive the spread of PCa cells to surrounding tissues by regulating interactions between cells and degrading the ECM. PCa cells often enhance angiogenesis by producing PDGF, which increases VEGF expression and indirectly regulates vascular development In addition, the AR plays a crucial role in the progression of PCa by regulating angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a key process by which tumors acquire oxygen and nutrients to promote growth and metastasis, with VEGF serving as a central regulatory factor. Studies have shown that AR signaling can upregulate the expression of VEGF in the TME, thereby promoting the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and enhancing the formation of new blood vessels [ The VEGF family is identified as the most potent and crucial among the numerous factors involved in angiogenesis. Multiple factors in the PCa microenvironment can trigger VEGF production and subsequent angiogenesis. The VEGF family includes subtypes like vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGF-B), vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D), and placental growth factor (PLGF), with varying expression and functions in PCa. This diversity offers extensive evidence for investigating their mechanisms of action [ FGF, unlike VEGF, acts on various cell types, directly or indirectly stimulating angiogenesis as a mitogen specific to endothelial cells. The FGF family comprises proteins involved in embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression, exhibiting paracrine, autocrine, or endocrine functions [ PDGF, a peptide regulatory factor primarily secreted by macrophages, stimulates tissue cell growth. Its role in angiogenesis is weaker than that of FGF and VEGF, suggesting it may not be essential for the initial formation of blood vessels. Under physiological conditions, PDGF resides in platelets and is released upon platelet activation during blood coagulation, stimulating specific cell chemotaxis and growth. The PDGF family regulates tumor growth and metastasis through interactions with PCa cells. Specifically, PDGF family members activate multiple signaling pathways by binding to receptors on cancer cells surfaces, leading to cancer cells proliferation [ Endothelial cells directly influence PCa cells proliferation and invasion by secreting growth factors like VEGF and MMPs [ Stromal cells are essential for maintaining the structure and function of prostate tissue [ In this context, CAFs, as one of the most important stromal cells in the TME, play a particularly prominent role in PCa. CAFs promote PCa cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and matrix remodeling proteins. AR plays a key role in regulating the function of CAFs. AR signaling directly or indirectly modulates the gene expression of CAFs, altering the secretion of bioactive substances, and thereby promoting tumor progression [ The presence of stromal cells also significantly impacts the therapeutic response in PCa. Due to their involvement in forming and maintaining the PCa microenvironment, stromal cells may affect the delivery and efficacy of anticancer drugs [ 
 Decoding stromal cells: key players in PCa evolution. CAFs and adipocytes produce various ECM components and proteases such as MMPs. Some ECM components degrade, while others harden over time through continuous remodeling. PCa cells can activate CAFs by secreting IL-6, thereby promoting EMT and angiogenesis of PCa cells; Adipocytes can transform into malignant adipocytes, providing enhanced support and supply to PCa cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor stimulates endothelial cells to secrete pro-angiogenic factors like PDGF and VEGF, initiating the process of angiogenesis Stromal cells, such as CAFs and adipocytes, are crucial in the PCa microenvironment [ The ECM’s role in the PCa microenvironment has attracted significant attention and is a recent focus of research [ In previous research, microbiologists and cancer researchers have increasingly turned their attention to the biomedical aspects of the relationship between bacteria, viruses, and PCa [ 
 Exploring the intricate connection between microorganisms and PCa. Upon viral infection, normal cells may undergo integration of the virus into their DNA, resulting in apoptosis or transformation into pre-cancerous cells. Bacterial stimulation elicits inflammatory responses that can activate IL-15, influencing neutrophil activity and impacting PCa progression Despite the increasing focus on the relationship between microorganisms and PCa, the connection between AR and gut microbiota has not been extensively studied. However, recent evidence suggests that AR may indirectly regulate the composition of gut microbiota by influencing the host’s immune and metabolic states, thus impacting the development of PCa. Studies indicate that androgen signaling could alter the body’s metabolic activities and oxidative defense systems, thereby affecting the diversity and stability of the gut microbiota. For example, AR may influence the immune-metabolic state of PCa patients, which in turn affects the composition of the microbiota and indirectly impacts the tumor’s immune microenvironment. Additionally, certain gut microbiota are closely related to the host’s hormone levels and can metabolize androgens, further regulating the metabolic environment of both the gut and the tumor [ Various bacteria, such as those from the gut microbiota, inhabit prostate tissue, leading scientists to investigate their role in PCa development [ Viruses in the PCa microenvironment have generated significant interest in the academic community [ The intricate network of signaling pathways between PCa cells and their microenvironment profoundly influences the tumor’s behavior. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is closely linked to PCa cells proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [ The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has multiple effects on the TME. Firstly, it significantly influences the number and function of cancer stem cells (CSCs) by regulating their self-renewal and differentiation processes [ The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a critical cellular signaling cascade that activates Akt protein phosphorylation via PI3K kinase activation, ultimately resulting in mTOR activation [ The TNF family members play diverse roles in immune response regulation and cells survival [ The TNF family’s extensive involvement in the PCa microenvironment has significant implications for tumor development and treatment response [ Transcription factors in the PCa microenvironment profoundly regulate PCa development through multiple mechanisms [ Recent research indicates that the composition of gut bacteria can impact the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy [ Recent studies have indicated that gut commensal bacteria may play a significant role in the production and metabolism of androgens within the body, even in patients undergoing ADT. For example, some research has found that certain gut microbiota can produce androgens by metabolizing precursor substances, thereby affecting the host’s hormone levels and the immune microenvironment of tumors [ The  The role of bacteria and viruses in the PCa microenvironment entails intricate molecular mechanisms significantly influencing tumor progression and treatment response. Uncovering these mechanisms mediated by bacteria and viruses aids in enhancing the comprehension of PCa pathophysiological processes, offering fresh perspectives for designing future targeted therapy and immunotherapies (Table  
 Extrinsic factors in TME cells and internal factors in tumor cells and their effects Extrinsic factors (found in TME cells) In the field of PCa diagnosis, research on microenvironmental markers primarily involves multiple aspects, including genetic variations, ECM, extracellular vesicles, and metabolites [ 
 Exploring the PCa microenvironment: new advances in diagnosis. The diagnosis of the PCa microenvironment involves various biomarkers, including growth factors, pro-angiogenic factors, immune mediators, IL, chemokines, ECM components, CSCs, glycoproteins, and transcription factors In the section on therapeutic strategies for PCa, we highlight the importance of immunotherapy and stress the necessity of developing comprehensive treatment plans that consider the characteristics of the TME. However, the limited or absent responses seen in current PCa treatment strategies are mainly due to several factors. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of the TME have a significant impact on treatment outcomes. Particularly, diverse populations of immunosuppressive cells like Treg cells and MDSCs in the PCa microenvironment hinder effective anti-tumor immune responses through the secretion of suppressive cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10 [ 
 Exploring the PCa microenvironment: new advances in treatment.  Immunotherapy has become widely recognized in recent years for its distinct mechanisms of action. However, its applicability and efficacy within the TME remain a complex and worthy topic for in-depth research [ This review summarizes various components of the PCa microenvironment, such as immune cells, the vascular system, stromal cells, and microbiota. However, translating these findings into clinical practice requires further attention and in-depth research. Current studies mainly focus on the basic biological properties and functions of the components within the PCa microenvironment. Nonetheless, many challenges remain in effectively regulating these microenvironments in clinical settings to improve therapeutic outcomes. Tumor cells often recruit immune cells to the tumor site to combat foreign pathogens and infections [ The vascular system is crucial in the PCa microenvironment. VEGF promotes tumor growth and nourishment. Anti-VEGF drugs, including bevacizumab, apatinib, pazopanib, AZD2171, and sunitinib, have demonstrated efficacy in treating PCa. Ongoing phase II clinical trials are evaluating bevacizumab for CRPC, with preliminary results showing significant potential in delaying disease progression [ Stromal cells provide critical support within the PCa microenvironment by secreting various cytokines and growth factors, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. New therapeutic strategies targeting stromal cells are being developed [ The role of the microbiome in PCa progression is gaining attention. Research suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may influence PCa occurrence and development through immunomodulatory mechanisms. New microbiome modulation approaches to intervene in PCa are being explored. Preliminary data indicate that regulating the gut microbiota can enhance the immune response and improve treatment outcomes [ 
 PCa clinical implications and translational potential Moreover, identifying predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy response is critical for improving the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Current biomarkers that may influence the efficacy of immunotherapy in PCa include genetic-based markers such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability/mismatch repair (MSI/MMR), and cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) mutations, along with cell type proportion markers like the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) [ In recent years, TMB has gained significant attention as a biomarker in ICI research. Research indicates that PCa patients with high TMB are more likely to benefit from ICI therapy. Tumors with high TMB typically express numerous abnormal proteins, which are displayed on the surface of tumor cells and recognized by immune cells, thereby triggering an immune response [ Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) results from the loss of any mismatch repair protein, leading to the accumulation of errors during DNA replication and ultimately causing MSI. Tumors with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H)/dMMR often show increased T-cell infiltration, making them more responsive to ICIs [ Loss of CDK12 disrupts DNA damage repair, leading to increased gene fusions, a higher neoantigen load, and enhanced T-cell infiltration. Several studies have reported that PCa patients with CDK12 mutations are more likely to respond to ICIs. Wu et al. observed that 2 out of 4 mCRPC patients with biallelic CDK12 inactivation responded positively to PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy [ A meta-analysis of 7,228 PCa patients found that elevated NLR and PLR were associated with poor prognosis, suggesting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between elevated NLR/PLR and adverse outcomes in PCa remain unclear and require further investigation [ PCa stands out as one of the prevailing male malignancies, commanding widespread attention due to its profound impact on public health. As medical technology advances at a rapid pace, the intricate landscape of the PCa microenvironment has emerged as a focal point for comprehensive investigation. Delving into the microenvironment of PCa unveils a labyrinthine network system characterized by its complexity and multi-level interactions. Comprising immune cells, angiogenic factors, stromal cells, and an array of molecular signaling pathways, among other constituents, this milieu offers a rich tapestry of avenues for unraveling the mechanisms underlying PCa pathogenesis and progression. The microenvironment of PCa serves as a dynamic arena wherein myriad cellular and molecular players orchestrate a delicate balance between tumor suppression and promotion. Understanding the interplay between these elements holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic modalities and preventive strategies aimed at mitigating the burden of PCa. Notably, insights gleaned from dissecting the PCa microenvironment have the potential to revolutionize existing paradigms in cancer treatment, fostering tailored approaches that capitalize on the unique vulnerabilities of the tumor milieu. While the precise determinants driving the high incidence of PCa remain incompletely elucidated, a constellation of factors, including environmental exposures, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle variables, have been implicated in shaping the risk landscape of this disease. Unraveling the intricate interplay between these factors and their influence on the PCa microenvironment represents a critical frontier in the quest to curtail the burgeoning burden of this disease. In essence, the exploration of the PCa microenvironment transcends the confines of traditional oncological research paradigms, heralding a new era characterized by precision medicine and personalized interventions tailored to the unique molecular landscape of individual tumors. By deciphering the intricacies of the PCa microenvironment, researchers stand poised to forge innovative therapeutic strategies that hold the promise of transforming the management of this formidable disease entity. This review comprehensively summarized the role of the microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the specific background of PCa, and providing in-depth analysis of immune cells, angiogenesis, and molecular mechanisms. This not only helps to comprehensively understand the pathogenesis of PCa but also provides rich ideas for future treatments. Based on this, further exploration of the unique characteristics of the PCa microenvironment is warranted. The role of immune cells in the PCa microenvironment, including different subsets of T lymphocytes and their functions, as well as the crucial role of APCs, is carefully analyzed. The relationship between angiogenesis and PCa, including the regulation of the VEGF family and the complex interaction between endothelial cells and cancer cells, reveals the delicate balance between PCa growth and blood supply. The functions of stromal cells, especially the synergistic effects of CAFs and stromal cells, and the impact of ECM changes on PCa development, are elaborated in this review, focusing on molecular mechanisms research. The role of signaling pathways in the PCa microenvironment, with particular emphasis on the regulatory mechanisms of the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, is explored. The importance of cytokines and regulatory factors, especially the role of the TNF family and transcription factors in the regulation of the PCa microenvironment, uncovers mysteries at the molecular level. An in-depth exploration of the potential clinical applications of the PCa microenvironment reveals the impact of the microenvironment on PCa diagnosis, including the potential application of microenvironmental biomarkers, providing clinicians with more precise diagnostic tools. Insights into treatment strategies from the microenvironment, including the potential application of immunotherapy and targeted drug research on the PCa microenvironment, provide new directions for future treatments. Reviewing the challenges in the current research field of PCa microenvironment and the development of new technological methods, it becomes evident that addressing technical limitations and theoretical challenges necessitates collaborative efforts to achieve breakthroughs. We have noticed that there are still some challenges in the clinical translation and application of PCa microenvironment research. Although we have mentioned several microenvironment biomarkers, their accuracy, specificity, and clinical predictive value still need further validation in clinical practice. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the interactions among various biomarkers in the microenvironment needs to be strengthened, which will help reveal more details about the complexity of the TME. Firstly, in current PCa microenvironment research, we must recognize that there are some challenges. For example, in terms of clinical translation, although we have identified multiple microenvironment biomarkers, their accuracy and specificity have not been fully validated in clinical practice. Furthermore, the existing research lacks a thorough understanding of the interactions among various biomarkers in the microenvironment, leading to a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the complexity of the TME. In response to these challenges, we propose several future research directions: ①Establishment of biomarker combination models: develop combination models for different PCa subtypes and clinical stages, combining multiple microenvironment biomarkers to improve diagnostic and predictive accuracy. ②Application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence in microenvironment analysis: utilize bioinformatics and artificial intelligence technologies to delve into microenvironment data, discover new biomarkers, signaling pathways, and their clinical significance. ③Research on microenvironment-regulated treatment strategies: explore treatment strategies targeting the microenvironment, such as targeted therapy for specific biomarkers, immunomodulatory therapy, etc., to achieve more precise personalized treatment. ④Exploration of precise treatment strategies for microenvironment regulation: explore precise treatment strategies targeting the microenvironment, such as targeted therapy for specific biomarkers, immunomodulatory therapy, etc., to achieve personalized treatment and improve treatment effectiveness. ⑤Multi-center large-sample clinical validation studies: conduct multi-center, large-sample clinical validation studies to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of new biomarkers or models in clinical practice, thereby accelerating their clinical application. ⑥Precision medicine perspective: advocate starting from the perspective of precision medicine, combining personalized treatment strategies and microenvironment characteristics, develop biomarker combination models suitable for different patients, and apply them in clinical practice. ⑦Prospective clinical research: we advocate for prospective, multi-center clinical research to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of new biomarker combination models in different clinical scenarios, providing more reliable evidence for personalized treatment. Exploring these future research directions will provide a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of PCa microenvironment research, promote the clinical application of microenvironment biomarkers, and lay a more solid scientific foundation for personalized treatment and precision medicine in PCa.","['Prostate cancer', 'Tumor microenvironment', 'Immune cells', 'Vascular system', 'Stromal cells', 'Microbiota']",2024-10-12,Molecular Cancer,AIDS
11470680,Perioperative outcomes of thoracoscopic versus non-thoracoscopic minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Pectus excavatum is the most common chest wall deformity, with the Nuss procedure being the preferred surgical approach for correction. However, the decision to use thoracoscopic assistance remains challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of thoracoscopic-assisted versus non-thoracoscopic-assisted minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (TA-MIRPE vs. NTA-MIRPE). A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Embase, WOS, and CBM databases for studies published from 2010 to the present related to this topic. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 and STATA 15.0, with primary comparisons focusing on postoperative complications and the incidence of poor incision healing. Eighteen studies involving a total of 5933 patients were included in the analysis, with 1670 undergoing non-thoracoscopic surgery and 4263 receiving thoracoscopic surgery. The meta-analysis revealed that, compared to the NTA-MIRPE group, the TA-MIRPE group had longer operation times [SMD = 1.71, 95% CI (1.14, 2.28),  While TA-MIRPE is associated with longer operation times and hospital stays, it offers greater patient satisfaction, reduces postoperative complications, and enhances surgical safety.","Pectus excavatum (PE) has the highest incidence among congenital chest wall morphological disorders, and its incidence rate is approximately 1‰-3‰ [ Before Dr. Nuss pioneered the MIRPE (also known as NUSS) procedure in 1997, most clinicians used Ravitch or other osteotomies to treat pectus excavatum. These surgical methods need to correct posterior concave deformities by cutting off the costal cartilage, which can cause trauma to the patient, and the incidence of correction failure due to postoperative incision infection is high [ 
 
 Since 2010, all studies comparing TA-MIRPE surgery with NTA-MIRPE surgery were eligible for inclusion. Research indicators: (1) the report contains statistical data on the short-term effect of surgery (1) the time of surgery; (2) intraoperative blood loss(IBL); (3) length of postoperative hospital stay(LPHS); 4),Postoperative complications: <1 > infection of the surgical site; <2 > Postoperative lung infection; <3 > Postoperative pneumothorax; <4 > Pleural effusion or empyema; <5 > Bloody pleural effusion; 5)length of hospital stay(LHS); groups incidence one of the postoperative complications is included in the total complication statistics. (2) Long-term effect indicators of surgery: (1) Postoperative patient satisfaction evaluation indicators: <1 > Postoperative chest X-ray showed no depression in the sternum; <2 > flatness and symmetry of the appearance of the thoracic cage; <3 > Satisfaction of postoperative orthopedics for children and families; <4 > Thoracic fullness, stretchability, and elasticity. Compliance with clause 3 or more is excellent, and compliance with clause 3 or less is nonexcellent. (2) Surgery-related unplanned readmission rate and reoperation rate. 
 
 Patients were not divided into experimental and control groups. The baseline status of the participant was unclear or was not compared. The “(Thoracoscopy OR Nonthoracoscopic) AND pectus excavatum OR funnel chest” were identified in the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Science of the Web, nad CBM databases to search for all studies of controlled clinical trials published from 2010 to present without language restrictions. After removing duplicate studies, two authors independently judged eligibility for inclusion. Controversial literature was judged by an independent third party to decide whether to include it in the analysis. The following data were extracted: (1) basic information about the research, such as the name of the first author of the document, the journal and the date of publication; (2) key information on the type of study and quality evaluation; (3) characteristics of the preoperative group of patients, such as age, sex, and the Haller index between different groups; and (4) outcome indicators, such as surgery-related data, including OT, IBS, the PC rate and LPHS, the unplanned readmission rate and the unplanned surgical rate. The quality of the eligible papers was assessed using ROBINS-I tools and methods [ The statistical indicators, such as the mean (M) and standard deviation (σ), were included for all measurement and counting data in all eligible studies and for the number of people. In addition, if the research report used medians and interquartile intervals (IQRs) to report the concentration and dispersion trends of the samples, the BC method was used (Box Cox Method) was used [ A total of 2045 articles were identified—2042 from the initial search and an additional 3 from the literature review. After 35 duplicates were removed, 2010 remained. A total of 1962 publications that did not satisfy the objectives and inclusion criteria of this study were eliminated by reviewing the titles and abstracts, and the remaining 48 were excluded. After further reading the full texts, 13 articles lacked specific data, 5 articles with inconsistent statistical results and 2 crossover studies were eliminated; ultimately, 18 articles were included, including 3 RCTs, 15 RCTs on the NRCT, 13 on the TP and 5 on the NTP.

 Major complications Seven studies [ Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated that TA-MIRPE surgery prolonged the duration of surgery (SMD = 0.77,  RCT versus NRCT subgroup analysis (NRCT group OR = 1.764,  The overall complication and incision complication rates in the TA-MIRPE surgery group were greater than those in the NTA-MIRPE surgery group (overall complication rate: OR = 0.54,  Subgroup analysis of teaching hospitals showed that the performance of teaching hospitals was more satisfactory than that of nonteaching hospitals [OR = 0.54,  Sensitivity analyses were performed using a single-exclusion approach, in which outcome measures were meta-analyzed and each study was removed sequentially. With respect to the time to surgery, reoperation rate, LPHS, and TLHS, the conclusions of the present study did not significantly change after the loss of included studies one by one; thus, the conclusions we summarize are trustworthy.

 Complication funnel plots MIRPE surgery is the main means of clinicallyecting the pectus funnel and has the advantages of reliability, low trauma and strong patient acceptability. When MIRPE surgery was initially performed, thoracoscopy was not used. Thoracoscopic assisted surgery was originally used to meet the needs of serious infundibular thoracic surgery. With continuous practice, progress and improvement in surgical details, to increase the safety of surgery, many branches were born, such as routine use of thoracoscopy or subxiphoid small-incision assisted surgery. The application of these surgical methods is related to the experience and level of the surgeons and lack unified norms and tests. Routine use of thoracoscopy is the most common of these surgical modalities. In this paper, by searching the clinical research literature published since January 2010 and comparing the perioperative outcomes of two groups of patients who underwent MIRPE surgery with and without thoracoscopy, it was found that although TA-MIRPE surgery prolonged the operation time, it was associated with shorter hospital stays, greater patient satisfaction, and lower surgery-related complications. The remaining results showed no significant difference. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of thoracoscopy in MIRPE surgery. First, in general, the introduction of TA-MIRPE surgery has obvious benefits for patients in terms of short-term evaluation indicators. For complications such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion and incision infection, thoracoscopic surgery is highly advantageous. These benefits may be related to the fact that most thoracoscopic surgery operations are completed in a visual environment, which reduces tissue damage during the operation [ Although thoracoscopic surgery has a good reputation for safety, nonthoracic surgery also offers remarkable benefits in several areas, including less time spent recovering from surgery, less equipment needed for the procedure, and less expensive therapy. Moreover, favorable surgical outcomes and low rates of complications can be observed during nonthoracic surgery performed by a significant number of highly qualified and experienced medical professionals [ This paper has certain limitations. First, due to the low acceptance rate of randomly selected surgical methods, there were only three RCT trials in the subgroup analysis, Kang Chao 2019 [ The results of our meta-analysis revealed that, compared with NTA-MIRPE surgery, TA-MIRPE surgery had a longer operation time, but the incidence of PC, especially when the incision healed poorly, was significantly lower. Postoperative patient satisfaction was higher, and 30-day unplanned readmission rates were lower. These results indicate that thoracoscopic assistance plays a positive role in improving the safety of surgery in MIRPE patients. Future research needs to evaluate the improvement in cardiopulmonary function and psychological status of patients who underwent thoracoscopic or nonthoracoscopic surgery. The influence of differences in the education levels of surgeons and hospitals was excluded.","['Pectus exavatum (PE)', 'Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE)', 'Nuss procedure', 'Thoracoscopy', 'Meta-analysis', 'Systematic review']",2024-10-12,Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery,AIDS
11470662,"Examining concordance of sexual-related factors and PrEP eligibility with HIV risk perception among adolescent girls and young women: cross-sectional insights from DREAMS sites in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia","HIV risk perception is an important cognition for prevention, theoretically engendering service-seeking and risk-reduction behaviors, but its composition remains poorly understood. We examined country-specific correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk among sexually active adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, aged 15–24 years) without HIV in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia. We also explored overlaps between self-appraised HIV exposure risk and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility to identify engagement opportunities. We analyzed cross-sectional data (2016/2017) to estimate sexual-related correlates of self-appraised HIV exposure risk (likely vs. not, temporally framed as “ever”) using log-Poisson models with robust standard errors. For sexual-related factors with an unadjusted  Few AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya [ AGYW's HIV risk perceptions were mostly influenced by factors beyond their locus of control. Conditional PrEP eligibility criteria may inhibit AGYW’s access and uptake in some settings: countries should consider decoupling these factors to minimize barriers. Intersections between autonomy, behaviors, and perceptions among AGYW in gender-inequitable settings warrants further investigation. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-024-20276-4.","The United Nations has committed to ending HIV/AIDS by 2030; to increase the likelihood of achieving this goal, interim 2025 targets were set at ≤ 370,000 annual global seroconversions [ The expanding HIV prevention toolkit provides AGYW with new options to reduce their HIV risk. In 2015, once-daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) became the first prevention method AGYW could use without partner cooperation, but initiation, adherence, and continuation remains low due to pill burden, side effect concerns, and stigma [ Despite their heightened risk for HIV acquisition, AGYW do not reliably use HIV prevention services and methods [ Improving AGYW’s HIV prevention outcomes necessitates understanding of the behaviors, circumstances, and experiences that influence how they perceive their risk of HIV acquisition. However, the underpinnings of AGYW’s HIV risk perception are rarely examined, highlighting its formulation is poorly understood. Illuminating these factors could inform activities and interventions to improve AGYW’s access, initiation, and effective use of HIV prevention services and methods, including PrEP [ This secondary analysis used cross-sectional data collected from AGYW residing in DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe) study sites in urban/peri-urban Kenya (2016–2017), rural Malawi (2017), and urban Zambia (2016–2017) during DREAMS’ pre-intervention phase. Briefly, DREAMS was a multi-component and -sectoral partnership to reduce AGYW’s HIV risk by implementing a suite of interventions targeting AGYW, families, partners, and communities [ To focus on HIV prevention, the samples included AGYW who self-reported being HIV negative and having sex in the last 12 months (sexually active). In Zambia, the sample comprised those currently having sex at the time of the interview due to questionnaire skip logic. Supplemental Material 1 presents the definitions for all study measures. We measured HIV risk perception using self-appraised likelihood of HIV exposure, ""how likely it is that you have been exposed to HIV?"", a question asked after all HIV-related risk modules, facilitating a retrospective assessment. We operationalized response categories as Likely (very likely, somewhat likely) vs. Unlikely (unlikely, not at all), excluding participants with missing or “don’t know” responses [ To identify variables for multivariable control, we explored sociodemographic factors, encompassing age group (adolescent girls, aged 15–19 years [AG] vs. young women, aged 20–24 years [YW]); ever-pregnant, orphanhood, out-of-school, employment, marital, and socio-economic status (SES); hunger; location; and DREAMS enrollee status. We assessed anxiety/depression symptoms and comprehensive HIV knowledge because they can vary risk perception [ First, we examined HIV-associated behaviors, including inconsistent condom use, STI symptoms, age-disparate and inter-generational sex, transactional sex, multiple sexual partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use. Next, we assessed relationship characteristics: partner(s)’ 1) community residence, 2) other partners, 3) HIV status, and 4) likely HIV exposure. Finally, we investigated respondents' survivorship of physical and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) and non-partner sexual violence. PrEP eligibility was measured using criteria in each country’s national guidelines. Below, we outline the criteria for each country, followed by analytic definitions in parentheses. Kenya’s criteria included multiple partners (multiple partners), condomless sex (inconsistent condom use), partners’ unknown HIV status (does not know partner[s] HIV status), any partners at risk of HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), STI diagnosis (STI symptoms in last 6 months), received money/material support for sex (transactional sex), survived forced sex or physical assault (survived non-partner sexual violence or physical or sexual IPV), and history of sex while under the influence of drugs/alcohol (alcohol use) [ For Malawi, eligibility criteria comprised having an STI in the last 6 months (STI symptoms in last 6 months), giving/receiving monetary incentives for sex (transactional sex), and having an age-disparate partner and ever being pregnant (positive indications for both ever-pregnant and age-disparate sex, as defined by national guidelines) [ In Zambia, criteria encompassed sex with multiple partners without condoms (positive indications for both multiple partners and inconsistent condom use, as defined by national guidelines), partner has HIV/at substantial risk of acquiring HIV (partner[s] likely exposed to HIV), history of STIs (STI symptoms in last 6 months), and prior post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) use (ever used PEP) [ We could not include sero-different partnership dynamics (Kenya, Malawi, Zambia), sharing injection materials (Kenya, Zambia), or PEP use (Kenya) due to questionnaire limitations. We operationalized PrEP eligibility as a binary measure (≥ 1 criteria versus None). For Malawi and Zambia, we also explored eligibility by decoupling their conditional criteria (e.g., Malawi: age-disparate sex and ever-pregnant, Zambia: multiple partners and inconsistent condom use). We examined country-specific correlates of likely HIV exposure, the dependent variable, using prevalence ratios (log-Poisson models, robust standard errors) generated with R (v.4.4.0) [ We descriptively explored intersections between HIV risk, PrEP eligibility, and risk perception by assessing PrEP eligibility among AGYW with ≥ 1 sexual-related risk factor and describing the proportion of AGYW reporting likely HIV exposures by PrEP eligibility status. Overall, 5364 eligible AGYW in Kenya ( Across countries, most respondents were YW (Kenya: 72.7%, Malawi: 72.3%, Zambia: 79.4%) who had ever been pregnant (Kenya: 74.7%, Malawi: 94.8%, Zambia: 67.3%; Tables  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Kenya Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  Nearly all respondents (Kenya: 98.7%, Malawi: 99.8%, Zambia: 98.9%) reported at least one sexual-related HIV-associated factor. Inconsistent condom use was the most prevalent HIV-associated behavior in all countries (Kenya: 75.3%, Malawi: 93.9%, Zambia: 74.8%). Violence survivorship (Kenya: 48.4%, Malawi: 37.5%, Zambia: 45.3%) and age-disparate sex (Kenya: 43.8%, Malawi: 33.4%, Zambia: 57.8%) were also prevalent. Believing partner(s) were likely exposed to HIV was particularly common in Malawi (Kenya: 16.0%, Malawi: 58.1%, Zambia: 8.3%). Table  After controlling for these sociodemographic and cognitive factors, correlates of likely HIV exposures included STI symptoms (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR] = 1.44 [1.03–2.01]) and partner(s)’ non-community residence (APR = 1.40 [1.00–1.95]), other partners (APR = 2.23 [1.51–3.28]), unknown status (APR = 1.81 [1.24–2.63]), and likely HIV exposure (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.82 [1.06–3.14], Yes: APR = 5.77 [3.95–8.43], ref: No). Table  Correlates of risk perception among sexually active AGYW in Malawi Bolded aPR [95% CI] indicates  After adjustment, transactional sex (APR = 1.37 [1.13–1.66]); multiple sex partners (APR = 1.21 [1.02–1.44]); alcohol use (APR = 1.22 [1.03–1.45]); partner(s)’ other partners (Don’t’ know: APR = 1.29 [1.13–1.47], Yes: APR = 1.43 [1.24–1.65], ref: No), unknown status (APR = 1.16 [1.02–1.33]), and likely HIV exposure (Yes: APR = 2.86 [2.40–3.41], ref: No); and physical (APR = 1.16 [1.01–1.33]) and sexual (APR = 1.56 [1.39–1.75]) IPV emerged as correlates.

This PrEP eligibility examination decouples these conditional criteria and treats each factor as their own criterion N/A = Not applicable because Kenya had no conditional PrEP criteria in their national guidelines In the PrEP eligibility column, Dark Blue indicates PrEP-eligible, and Dark Orange represents PrEP-ineligible. In the self-appraised HIV exposure column, Blue highlights self-reported likely HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW, whereas Light Blue represents unlikely exposures in this same group; Orange indicates likely HIV exposures among PrEP-ineligible AGYW, while Light Orange reflects unlikely exposures in the same classification Self-appraised likely HIV exposures were relatively low among PrEP-eligible AGYW (Kenya: 16.5%, Malawi: 48.5%, Zambia: 18.8%). Also, few PrEP-ineligible AGYW reported likely HIV exposures (Kenya: 6.4%, Malawi: 43.7%, Zambia: 4.8%). While Malawi’s and Zambia’s decoupled PrEP criteria did not proportionally increase self-appraised HIV exposures among PrEP-eligible AGYW (46.5% and 9.6%, respectively), the number of AGYW falling within these categories respectively increased by 74.4% and 31.8%. In this study with sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, self-reported likely HIV exposures were uncommon amid ubiquitous HIV risk (i.e., reporting ≥ 1 HIV risk factor). Correlates of likely HIV exposure primarily related to factors beyond respondents’ locus of control, spanning partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure (all countries), other partners (Kenya, Malawi), unknown status (Kenya, Malawi), non-community residence (Kenya); physical and sexual IPV (Malawi); and non-partner sexual violence (Zambia). Other correlates included STI symptoms in Kenya and transactional sex, multiple partners, and pre-coital alcohol use in Malawi. Exploring overlaps between HIV risk perception and PrEP eligibility highlighted that Kenya’s criteria captured most at-risk AGYW. Decoupling conditional criteria in Malawi’s (age-disparate sex + ever-pregnant) and Zambia’s (multiple partners + condomless sex) guidelines could improve risk identification. Self-reported likely HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligibility groupings, but decoupling Malawi’s criteria could increase PrEP engagement opportunities. Without improving AGYW’s actual-perceived risk disconnect, HIV prevention services and interventions will remain underutilized. Partnership-related factors, primarily in Kenya and Malawi, influenced AGYW’s HIV risk perception most, specifically partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, having other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence. Other studies also found partners’ behaviors and characteristics influence AGYW’s HIV risk perception [ Concordant with HIV risk research, AGYW’s survivorship of IPV and non-partner violence also affected HIV risk perceptions [ The remaining associative factors in Malawi—transactional sex, multiple partnerships, pre-coital alcohol use—and Kenya, STI symptoms, also aligned with epidemiologic data [ We found self-appraised HIV exposures were low in PrEP-eligible and -ineligible AGYW, suggesting most PrEP-eligible respondents are unlikely to seek out PrEP [ Our analysis supports that criteria-based eligibility might prevent sexually active AGYW from receiving the care and/or interventions necessary to reduce their HIV risk. By decoupling their conditional PrEP criteria, Malawi and Zambia could correctly identify > 85% of at-risk AGYW and potentially increase PrEP interactions by ~ 70% and ~ 30%, respectively [ In ESA, PrEP availability and accessibility has increased significantly over the past decade due to national governments partnering with bi- and multilateral partners, like the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) [ Our study has some limitations. We could not fully measure physical and sexual IPV in Kenya and Zambia due to questionnaire limitations: our null findings might misrepresent actual associations. Zambia’s models are possibly overfitted given the small number of events. Surveys did not measure or fully capture serodifferent relationships, injection drug use, PEP use (Kenya), and violence (Kenya, Zambia); thus, the number of PrEP-eligible AGYW might be underrepresented. Also, surveys used a 12-month recall period for most measures, while guidelines use a 6-month period, potentially inflating estimates of PrEP-eligible AGYW. Since all the data were self-reported, including HIV status, our data were potentially affected by social desirability, which could have attenuated effects and associations. Sexually active AGYW in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia are at increased risk for HIV. HIV risk perception could motivate AGYW to seek out, access, and use HIV prevention services and interventions, but AGYW’s low HIV risk perception often contradicts their actual HIV risk. In examining correlates of AGYW’s HIV risk perception, we discovered extrinsic factors—partner(s)’ likely HIV exposure, other partners, unknown HIV status, and non-community residence; and physical and sexual violence from partners and non-partners—primarily increased AGYW’s HIV risk perception. Transactional sex, multiple partnerships, and pre-coital alcohol use also increased Malawian AGYW’s risk perception, as did STI symptoms in Kenyan AGYW. Complementary analyses of overlaps between PrEP eligibility and risk perception highlighted self-appraised HIV exposures were low across PrEP-eligible and -ineligible categorizations. To meaningfully increase access and use of HIV prevention services and interventions, improvements in AGYW’s HIV risk appraisal, identification, and perception are needed; deeper examination of the interplay between agency, behaviors, and perceptions would advance this goal. Otherwise, their current suboptimal utilization of HIV prevention services and methods will persist.

11470628,Effectiveness of the active communication education program in improving the general quality of life of older adults who use hearing aids: a randomized clinical trial,"Hearing loss in older adults affects general, generic health-related and disease-specific quality of life (QoL). The conventional strategy to address it is through hearing aids, which have been shown to improve disease-specific QoL. However, the long-term results regarding general quality of life are unknown, and communication problems and stigma associated with hearing loss may persist. An effective intervention strategy to address these problems is group communication programs, most notably Active Communication Education (ACE). This program has been shown to increase communication strategies and reduce communication activity limitations and participation restrictions. These precedents allow us to hypothesize that this program could improve general QoL. A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 114 older adult hearing aid users. Fifty-four subjects composed the intervention group that received the ACE program, while 60 subjects composed the control group that received an informational-lectures type intervention. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used to measure general QoL. Measurements were taken before and right after the intervention, with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Multilevel linear mixed models were estimated, considering the WHOQOL-BREF dimension scores and total score as the outcomes, and an interaction term between time since intervention and group as the predictor. Within- and between-group comparisons were made. Compared to the baseline time-point, the ACE group showed significant improvements right after the intervention, and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups for the dimensions of psychological health, social relationships, environment, and total score. Compared to the control group, the ACE group exhibited significantly greater improvements in the social dimension at all postintervention assessments, as well as in the environment dimension and total score at the 12-month follow-up. The ACE program improved general QoL in terms of social relationships and environment dimensions, which lasted up to 12 months after the intervention. Therefore, ACE is positioned as an effective complement for HA users, enhancing and delivering new benefits related to broader aspects of QoL not necessarily tied to health. ISRCTN54021189 (retrospectively registered on 18/07/2023). The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12877-024-05424-0.","Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common sensory deficits in the older population [ Moreover, HL in older adults also affects quality of life (QoL) [ The impact of HL on the quality of life (QoL) of older adults has been evidenced by instruments measuring general QoL [ The conventional strategy to address HL in older people is to use hearing aids (HAs). HAs have been associated with a lower risk of falls [ Regarding generic health-related QoL, the results of HAs use are conflicting [ The absence of long-term benefits of HAs on generic health-related QoL, can be attributed to the fact that HAs do not provide benefits in the broader aspects of QoL that these instruments assess. Additionally, HAs use do not constitute a rehabilitation process itself, which is why some users continue to experience communication problems [ While HAs provide audibility benefits in some everyday situations, including certain social contexts, they do not guarantee the strengthening of weakened social networks or the resumption of social activities restricted by self-stigmatization [ Group communication programs are effective rehabilitation strategies for addressing both communication problems and the self-stigmatization of HL, and thus, they are positioned as a potential strategy to improve the general QoL of older adults using HAs. These interventions teach communication strategies and provide psychosocial benefits [ One such program is Active Communication Education (ACE), which uses an interactive problem-solving approach [ To date, the effects of the ACE program on general QoL have not been studied. However, its previously reported benefits in increasing the use of communication strategies, reducing communicative activity limitations and participation restrictions, as well as potential improvements in social identity inherent in group interventions, allow us to hypothesize that the ACE program is an effective strategy for enhancing general QoL. With this in consideration, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the ACE program on the general QoL of older adult HAs users. The present study analyzed the secondary outcome of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel design clinical trial (ISRCTN54021189; retrospectively registered available on  The participants were older adults (≥ 65 years) who had been fitted with HAs in at least one ear at any time in the last five years through Chile’s public health system (within this system, HAs are provided at no cost or with a nominal co-payment not exceeding 20% of their price) [ 
 CONSORT study flowchart by treatment strategy. ACE: Active Communication Education Participants were randomized utilizing computer-generated stratified blocks by region, with blocks of six participants used to create four possible assignment combinations. The allocation of patients to control or treatment groups within blocks is done in a way that ensures randomization while maintaining the desired allocation ratios within each block [ It is recommended that, whenever possible, blinding should be used in randomized clinical trials. Blinding of at least the trial participants and treatment providers helps to reduce information bias [ The interventions started two months after recruitment, with 6- and 12-months follow-ups after the intervention. The programs were carried out by four trained speech and language therapists: two in the ACE program and two in an informational lecture-type program. In Chile, speech and language therapists have specialized training in audiology, so they are the professionals in charge of providing assessment and rehabilitation services in the field of hearing. Before starting the interventions, the professionals received a briefing on the respective programs to be used in the study. In this briefing, they were informed about their roles in each program, the duration and frequency of the sessions, the topics to be covered each week, and the expected group dynamics. The ACE group, composed of 9 subgroups of between 5 and 6 people, received the Chilean adaptation of the ACE program [ In the first session, the rules and structure of the program were presented, experiences with HL were shared, and introductory topics such as hearing in old age and the Chilean national public policy on HAs were addressed. In the second session, communication needs, problems, and strategies to solve them were identified and discussed. The third session discussed different types of communication strategies and their application in everyday situations. The fourth session focused on understanding speech in noisy environments and how to overcome these challenges. In the fifth session, communication with difficult speakers was addressed. The sixth session focused on difficulties in hearing other sounds, such as telephones and doorbells, the usefulness of lip reading and strategies for recognizing visemes and other facial movements associated with certain sounds. The control group, composed of 10 subgroups of 5 to 6 people, participated in an informational lecture-type intervention, which was designed especially for this study. The professionals in charge delivered information related to aging and hearing loss through an expository format. The topics covered in each session were selected to interest the group members and maintain their attendance. This intervention had the same frequency and duration as the ACE and did not include social interaction activities among participants. In the first session, the functioning of HAs and national public policies targeting individuals with HL were explained. The second session focused on age-related HL and rehabilitation options. The third session presented the biological changes associated with aging and which specialist to consult in case of difficulties. The fourth session addressed the cognitive changes and difficulties of aging and their impact on communication. In the fifth session, participants received guidance on hearing self-care related to noise exposure and other habits. Finally, the sixth session summarized the topics of previous sessions and provided guidance on when to consult a hearing care professional. The data were collected before the intervention, right after the intervention, and at the 6- and 12-months follow-ups after the intervention. The outcome of this study was the general QoL measured with the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire [ Multilevel linear mixed models were estimated, considering the WHOQOL-BREF dimension score and total score as the outcomes. The predictor was an interaction term between time since intervention and group. The models were adjusted for the respective estimates of baseline scores to correct for significant baseline differences observed in an unadjusted model (Table  Contact information was obtained for 515 hearing aid users seen at the participating primary health care centers. Of these, 261 were screened for eligibility. Finally, 114 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The ACE group comprised 54 subjects, and the control group comprised 60 (details in Fig.  
 Characteristics of the sample of patients involved in the control group and ACE group ( MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination The effect of the intervention over time was modeled for each of the dimensions and the total score (Table S4). Compared to the baseline timepoint, in the ACE group, significant increases in psychological health (Δβ = 1.45;  
 Baseline adjusted differences in total score and each of the dimensions in relation to the baseline time-point for the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire for the ACE group In the control group, significant increases in physical health (Δβ = 0.45;  
 Baseline adjusted differences in total score and each of the dimensions in relation to the baseline time-point for the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire for the control group No significant differences were observed between groups at any of the time points, except for social relationships in favor of the ACE group right after intervention ( 
 Between groups differences (ACE group - control group) on linear estimates for the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire and its dimensions Statistically significant values are highlighted in black The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the ACE program on general QoL in older adult users of HAs. To date, this is the first study to do so. This program showed significant improvements right after, 6 months after, and 12 months after the intervention in relation to the baseline, in the dimensions of psychological health, social relationships, and environment, in addition to the total score. These improvements can be attributed to the communicative strategies addressed by ACE and to the psychosocial benefits of interacting with peers. On the one hand, using communicative strategies is part of engaging coping behaviors, one of the main facilitators of social participation in older adults with HL [ Although the ACE program and a general QoL instrument were not used, the clinical trial by Preminger & Yoo [ However, other studies have not obtained the same results using generic health-related QoL instruments. Hickson et al. [ In a prospective study, Öberg et al. [ The differences between our study and those of Hickson et al. [ Individual differences among study participants also could explain these contrasting results. Hickson et al. [ Furthermore, Hickson et al. [ A finding not hypothesized in the present study was improvements in the control group. Although most of these improvements tended to diminish at 6 months, they were maintained at 12 months. Similarly, the control group of Hickson et al. study [ Rivera et al. [ In the present study, the control group may have experienced some unplanned psychosocial benefits from peer interaction. Although the control group intervention involved informational lectures and did not include social interaction activities, it is to be expected that participants would interact while waiting for the activity to begin or at the end of each session. They may have shared experiences or opinions during the development of the sessions. It has been described that unstructured psychosocial exercises also provide benefits [ Compared to the control group, improvements in the social dimension in the ACE group were significantly greater at all postintervention measurements. In addition, the improvements obtained in the environmental dimension were significantly greater at the 12-month measurement. These differences had a moderate effect size. These results can be attributed to the specific characteristics of ACE. Through communicative strategies, this program seeks to reduce communicative activity limitations and participation restrictions [ On the other hand, the communicative strategies of the ACE program also improve functional aspects of hearing in everyday situations [ Both the intervention of the control group and the ACE group had the same frequency and duration. For this reason, the significantly greater benefits obtained by the ACE group can be attributed to both the content and the interactive problem-solving approach inherent to the ACE program [ Finally, it is important to mention that the ACE program is a cost-effective, easy-to-implement rehabilitation strategy capable of reaching multiple users simultaneously. Detailed manuals are available in English, Spanish, and German on the official ACE website ( One of the main limitations of this study was the absence of measurements of communicative activity limitations, participation restrictions, use of communicative strategies, and engaged coping behaviors due to the absence of instruments in Spanish. As mentioned, the ACE program has been shown to improve some of these aspects [ A second limitation is that we did not quantify the degree of social interaction experienced by the participants in their respective interventions. The observed improvements in the control group can be attributed to psychosocial benefits from interaction with peers with HL [ The ACE program proved to be an effective intervention for improving general QoL in older adults with HL who are users of HAs. Specifically, improvements occurred in the dimensions of social relationships and perception of the environment and immediate surroundings, which persisted up to 12 months after the intervention. These benefits can be attributed to the communicative strategies addressed by the program and the interaction with peers under the same condition. For these reasons, ACE is positioned as an effective complement for HAs users, enhancing and delivering new benefits related to broader aspects of QoL not necessarily tied to health.

11470618,"Overall performance assessment of selected small-scale irrigation schemes using internal and external performance indicators in West Hararghe Zone, Eastern Ethiopia","This study was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of selected small-scale irrigation schemes using internal and external performance indicators. The performance of the irrigation schemes in relation to water balance was evaluated using three indicators. The results indicated that the relative water supply (RWS), relative irrigation supply (RIS), and field application ratio (FAR) of Midagdu irrigation scheme were 0.9, 1.3, and 0.75 respectively. This indicates that the water supply is not closely related to the water demand. However, for the Wadeti Irrigation scheme, the RWS, RIS, and FAR are 0.48, 0.35, and 2.83, respectively, indicating water stress. The Midagdu irrigation scheme shows 7496.75 birr/ha for both output per unit command area and output per unit cropped area. Output per unit irrigation water supply was 12.5 birr/m3, while output per unit water consumed was 4.4 birr/m3. For the Wadeti irrigation scheme, the values were 11,276.12 birr/ha, 11,276.12 birr/ha, 8.7 birr/m3, and 1.6 birr/m3, respectively. This study results showed that the Wadeti irrigation scheme is more land-efficient, while the Midagdu scheme is more water-efficient. The values of the hydraulic performance indicators Conveyance Efficiency (Ec), Water delivery capacity (WDC), and Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR), for the Midagdu irrigation scheme were 75 %, 0.45, and 0.8, respectively, while for the Wadeti irrigation scheme, the values were 42 %, 0.11, and 0.4, respectively. These results indicate that the water delivery performance of the two schemes was poor. Therefore, improving the hydraulic performance of the scheme requires minimizing water conveyance losses.","Water scarcity could be an obstacle to producing more food to meet the demands of an increasing world population. Improving the effectiveness existing irrigation schemes could be one strategy for conserving this valuable resource [ Increasing irrigation could serve as a viable solution to address the problem of food insecurity by increasing agricultural production [ Although the renewable surface area and groundwater of Ethiopia amount to 123 and 2.6 billion cubic meters per annum, respectively. And its distribution in terms of area and season does not provide adequate opportunities for sustainable economic growth. The severity of repeated droughts impacts the well-being of farming communities and the overall country's economy. Even in years with ample rainfall, floods can detrimentally affect the livelihoods of residents living near rivers and lakes due to the challenges they face in preventing or mitigating such events. As a result, irrigation projects are extensively examined, devised, and executed across the country from this significant perspective [ In addition, due to the poor performance of irrigation schemes in Ethiopia, the performance assessment of small-scale irrigation systems is not common in the Oromia region, especially in the West Haraghe zone. Hence, this study attempts to introduce the concept of internal and external performance indicators to assess the performance of small-scale irrigation schemes in West Hararghe. Water is a valuable resource for agricultural production. Life and sustainable development are seriously and increasingly threatened by water scarcity and misutilization. As water is the limiting factor in most of the world, increasing yields and sustaining food production depend mainly on irrigation. Therefore, the protection and development of water resources are crucial for irrigation facilities. The efficiency of numerous irrigation systems falls considerably short of their capacity as a result of various deficiencies, including inadequate design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The head regulator and the sluice gate built on the weir do not provide proper functions. During the irrigation period, farmers use local materials to prevent water leakage through the sluice gate. Most canals found in the scheme are unlined and cause water losses during the irrigation period. This gave rise to problems of a shortage of water in the scheme. Farmers use traditional irrigation water delivery systems and irrigation frequently, which results in poor water management. More often, farmers spend their time in cleaning canals, which they have to do every season before irrigation starts. Most of the water control structures constructed in the scheme are not operational. With a growing population and increasing demand for food, sustainable production increases from irrigated agriculture must be achieved. Barriers to the advancement and effectiveness of irrigation include inadequate availability of dependable hydrological and soil information, elevated expenses for investments and operations, water scarcity resulting from reduced water reservoir discharge, deficiencies in both design and execution, inadequate upkeep of infrastructure, and insufficient or substandard research on irrigated agriculture. In Ethiopia, irrigation projects are extensively researched, planned, and carried out. However, no attention has been given to monitoring and evaluating the performance of established irrigation schemes. An irrigation system of approximately 0.7 Mha is currently being developed for Ethiopia, and the effectiveness of the current plans is not well known [ Since, the main objectives of any irrigation system is crop production, land productivity, and water productivity, these factors must be regularly measured and monitored [ In addition, farmers' interest in irrigation has grown recently, raising the need for water and, consequently, the pressure to enhance the efficiency of two irrigation schemes in order to guarantee the productivity of the land and water. Furthermore, it has been crucial to collect accurate information regarding the relative performance of different structures, the system that adapts better to the output of irrigated agriculture, and the extent to which irrigation schemes realize the predetermined and identified objectives. The Midagdu Irrigation Scheme is geographically located in the West Hararghe Zone Oda Bultum woreda. The beneficiaries are found in PA  Location of the Midagdu irrigation scheme. This irrigation scheme is geographically located in the West Hararghe zone Chiro woreda. The site is geographically located between 9° 6′ 38.463″ W 121° 8′ 24.715‴ East and has an altitude of 1643 m above sea level ( Location of the Wadeti irrigation scheme. This study was carried out during the dry season ( Both formal and informal survey methods have been employed for primary data collection. Canal water flow measurements to obtain discharge, the current price of irrigated crop production (sorghum, maize, Banana, papaya and khat) in kg or in quintal. Individual interviews from the market and frequent field observations to obtain overall information on the schemes and to cross-check the secondary data collected from the West Hararghe Agricultural and Natural Resource Office. For the purpose of flow measurement, the floating method was adopted. Canal flow measurements were taken upstream, middle stream and downstream for each months of the irrigation season (October–January). Climatic data such as rainfall (mm), temperature ( Agronomic data such as crop type, planting date, harvesting date, productivity per hectare and production were collected from the West Hararghe Agricultural and Natural Resource Office. The soil types of the study area were collected from the design document of the schemes. Soil information such as infiltration rate, field capacity, and permanent wilting point, which is required for the CROPWAT 8 Model, was collected from Ref. [ Non-probability sampling (purposive sampling) techniques were used to determine Midagdu and wadeti irrigation schemes. Out of the total irrigation schemes found in seventeen districts in the West Hararghe Zone, Midagdu irrigation schemes were selected from Oda Bultum Woreda and Wadeti from Chiro Woreda irrigation schemes were purposively selected based on the availability of data and accessibility for transportation. The scarcity of water resources brought on by climate change has made flow measurements more significant in recent decades [ According to Ref. [ The part of the canal that is relatively straight and has a uniform cross section was selected. To determine the distance from the release point to the trajectory's end for the floating object, it is essential to ensure that the measuring location is consistently positioned downstream to avoid disrupting the water surface. The distance should be in meters. The cross-sectional area of the canal was measured by splitting it into several segments with at least 4 segments, as shown in  Divided canal segments [ L is the length of segment n, is the segment number, and d is the depth of the point. The measurement position should always be downstream to avoid disturbing the water surface. When gauging the stream's depth, the measurement process should commence from the stream bed upwards to the water's surface. Following the completion of all necessary measurements, the subsequent step involves computing the area for each segment. Finally, to determine a water flow by using V Q = discharge. A = Area. Reliable Water delivery performance could be assessed using Field application ratio (FAR), relative water supply (RWS), and relative irrigation supply (RIS) for effective irrigation management [ For the assessment of the selected irrigation schemes, four external indicators developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) were used for the comparative performance analysis of the selected small-scale irrigation schemes (see Equations  Using the CROPWAT 8 model, the crop and irrigation water demand of the major crops grown in the small-scale irrigation schemes of Midhagdu and Wadeti were determined. And by using Equation--- was used to determine the net crop and irrigation water requirements for the two seasons of the research year. NCWR = Net crop water requirement. CWR = Crop water requirement. IWR = Irrigation Water Requirement. Crop-1 up to n = represents the types of crop grown in respective irrigation schemes of the study area. Of the total hydraulic performance indicators, the three most common hydraulic performance indicators Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR), Conveyance Efficiency (Ec) and Water Delivery Capacity (WDC) were used due to limited data available to assess the hydraulic performance of irrigation canals. The delivery performance ratio is the simplest, yet probably the most important hydraulic performance indicator [ The water delivery capacity of the scheme indicates whether the peak crop water demand is fulfilled by the irrigation canal. In Hararghe and other areas, irrigation water distribution is managed by the beneficiaries themselves. They appoint a local leader, known as Abba melka, to ensure fair and equitable water allocation to each user [ The canal flow measurements for this study were taken once per month during the irrigation season by using the floating method for the year of study. The canal flow was measured upstream or at the diversion outlet, midstream and downstream of the canal, and finally, the average was taken as the actual amount of water delivered to the whole cropped area of the scheme. To compute the comparative and internal indicators for the analysis of the data to determine the performance assessment of the scheme, the annual crop water demand and annual irrigation water demand of the major crops grown in the schemes during the irrigation season are the main parameters needed. To determine the crop water Demand and irrigation water Demand of the irrigation scheme, the area coverage of the crop, planting and harvesting dates, and total growing days of each crop were collected. There are different major crop types cultivated under the Midagdu irrigation scheme. These crops have different crop water demands. The crop water demand of each crop was calculated by using the CROPWAT 8 model for the irrigation season (October–January) of the study period (2019).  Average monthly effective rainfall and ETO of the Midagdu irrigation scheme. The seasonal CWD and IWD of the Midagdu irrigation scheme. Average effective rainfall and ETO of the Midagdu scheme. The seasonal crop water demand and irrigation water demand of the Midagdu irrigation schemes was summarized in  Irrigation water and crop water demand of the Midagdu irrigation scheme. Average monthly effective rainfall and ETO of the Wadeti irrigation scheme. Average monthly effective rainfall and ETO of the Wadeti irrigation scheme. The annual crop water demand and irrigation water demand of the major crops grown in the scheme during the irrigation season are the main parameters needed. The same procedure as that used for Midagdu was used for this study to determine the crop water and irrigation water demand. The total CWR and IWR for major cultivated crops in Wadeti irrigation scheme, were analyzed using the CROPWAT 8 model. As observed from  Average monthly CWD and IWD of the Wadeti irrigation scheme. Average CWD and IWD of major cultivated crops in the Wadeti irrigation scheme in the study period of 2019. The relative water supply is one of the main indicator used to assess whether the water supply is suitable for agricultural production [ The calculated relative water supply (RWS) of the Midagdu and Wadeti schemes. Midagdu and Wadeti relative water supply values. The finding of this study reveals that, the relative water supply of Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes were 0.90 and 0.48, respectively. According to Ref. [ The relative irrigation supply, or the ratio of water delivered to crop net irrigation demand, is one of the main performance indicator [ The estimated values of the RIS of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. The field application ratios of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. The Midagdu and Wadeti relative irrigation supply values. The result shows that, the Midagdu irrigation scheme had a relative water supply of 1.3, indicating an excess of irrigation water, while the Wadeti scheme had a lower supply of 0.35. This excess water in Midagdu has likely led to waterlogging and increased salinity, negatively impacting agricultural productivity. The high relative irrigation supply (RIS) value observed in the Midagdu scheme (1.3) aligns with studies conducted in other parts of Ethiopia [ This indicator reflects the water balance, and its value fluctuates based on the actual volume of water delivered to the irrigated field. It is calculated as the ratio between the difference in potential evapotranspiration and effective rainfall or irrigation water demand (measured in depth) and the volume of water delivered to the field. The target value for the field application ratio varies depending on the irrigation technology employed, the prevailing climate, and the type of crop being cultivated – whether dry-foot crops or ponded rice, as cited in Ref. [ Irrigated crop production of Wadeti in 2018 and 2019 of study period. The Midagdu irrigation scheme had a field application ratio (FAR) of 0.75, indicating excess water was delivered to the irrigated field. However, the Wadeti field application ratio (FAR) of 2.83 suggests significant water stress, shows more water needs to be supplied from the canal to meet crop needs. As cited in Ref. [ The comparative performance of the schemes was evaluated using selected comparative indicators, namely, agricultural and water use performance, as indicated by international water management institutes [ To compare the two irrigation schemes in terms of their output per area and water supply, four comparative indicators were used for this study. Those indicators are output per cropped area, output per unit command area, output per unit irrigation supply and output per unit water consumed. To determine the comparative performance indicators, crop water and irrigation water requirements per season were calculated by using the CROPWAT 8 model. By using equations  The calculated values of the comparative performance indicators of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. The comparative performance indicator values in the 2018. Irrigated crops production of the Midagdu irrigation scheme in 2018 and 2019. The net CWD and IWD of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. Following equations  The values of the comparative performance indicators of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. As shown in  The values of the delivered and required discharge of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. Comparative performance indicators of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. There are different irrigation water delivery performance indicators [ The values of the delivered and required discharge of the Wadeti and Midagdu irrigation schemes. Peak irrigation water requirement values of the Wadeti irrigation scheme 2019. According to Ref. [ The peak irrigation requirements of the Wadeti and Midagdu irrigation schemes are calculated from the cropping pattern, planting date of each crop and cropping intensity of each crop in the scheme by using the FAO CROPWAT 8 model, and the results are presented in  The peak irrigation water requirements of the Midagdu irrigation scheme in the 2019. The values of the water delivery capacity of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. By using equation  The values of the hydraulic performance indicators of the two irrigation schemes. According to Ref. [ The water delivery capacity of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. The values of the hydraulic performance indicators under the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes. By using equation  Moreover, this study suggested that, the Wadeti irrigation scheme's conveyance efficiency is only 42 %, indicating uneven water distribution. This is primarily caused by water leakage and sedimentation in the canals, particularly in the longer, unlined sections. The irrigation scheme's low efficiency is due to silting by weeds and soil, narrow canals, and canal breaks, contributing to a large amount of water loss. As a result, it could influence local agricultural farms situated distant from water sources, where the main canals are lengthy and unlined, irrigation water losses in the conveyance system can account for a large portion of total water losses. The Bilate and Furfuro irrigation schemes in the Silti Zone, southern Ethiopia, were the subject of a similar study by Ref. [ The evaluations of the two irrigation schemes were carried-out by using internal (hydraulic and water balance) indicators and external (agricultural) indicators for the overall performance assessment of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes in west hararghe zone. The study revealed that, the overall relative water supplies of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes were 0.90 and 0.48, respectively. Accordingly, the amount of water applied in the Midagdu irrigation scheme was adequate to meet the crop water demand, whereas the amount of water applied in the Wadeti irrigation scheme was inadequate to meet the crop water requirement. When the crop water requirement is not fulfilled by the irrigation water supply, a condition of underirrigation occurs with the irrigation scheme. An RIS greater than one in the Midagdu irrigation scheme indicates that overirrigation occurred in the Midagdu irrigation scheme, which indicates that excess irrigation water was supplied. The relative irrigation supply is less than that in the Wadeti irrigation scheme, which shows that a condition of underirrigation occurs. This also indicates that less or less irrigation water was supplied to the irrigated field. The output per cropped area and the output per command area of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigations are the same since the irrigated area and command area are equal. However, as observed from the above figure, the Wadeti irrigation scheme had better land productivity in the 2018. Wadeti has a greater output per cropped area and output per command area. The main reasons might be due to the high perennial cropping intensity and type of crop grown in scheme. A higher output per irrigation supply and output per water consumed by the Midagdu irrigation scheme indicate that the Midagdu scheme is better at effectively utilizing water. Accordingly, the Wadeti irrigation scheme is better for land productivity, and the Midagdu scheme is better for water productivity. The delivery performance ratios of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes were 0.8 and 0.4 respectively. This indicates that there was water stress in both irrigation schemes and that the irrigation canal did not deliver the required discharge. This indicates that there is no equitable distribution of water among the water users at the head and tail reaches for both the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes during the irrigation season and indicates that there is a problem of water leakage and sedimentation of soil in the irrigation canal. Comparatively, the conveyance efficiency of the Wadeti irrigation scheme was very small, at less than 50 %, which shows that there is high canal leakage due to canal breakage in the middle reach of the scheme. The water delivery capacities of the Midagdu and Wadeti irrigation schemes were 0.45 and 0.11, respectively. A lower value of this indicator in both schemes indicates that canal capacity was more constrained to meet the maximum crop water demands. 
 Maintaining the existing irrigation canal is very important for reducing the conveyance loss rather than developing only a new irrigation scheme. Training farmers on irrigation schedules based on crop water demand is very important for reducing unequal water distributions and conflicts among water users at the head, middle and tail reaches for better water application efficiency. The water user association should be strengthened to improve irrigation water management. There is no funding available for this research.

11470597,Infectious disease events in people with HIV receiving kidney transplantation: Analysis of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study,"Since the implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy, kidney transplantation (K-Tx) has become a valuable option for treatment of end-stage kidney disease for people with HIV (PWH) with similar patient and graft survival as compared to HIV-uninfected patients. Little is known about the hazards and manifestations of infectious disease (ID) events occurring in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. Using linked information collected in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), we described in-depth demographical and clinical characteristics of PWH who received a K-Tx since 2008. Further, we performed recurrent time to event analyses to understand whether HIV was an independent risk factor for ID events. Overall, 24 PWH with 57 ID events were included in this study (100% match of SHCS to STCS). Of these, 17 (70.8%) patients had at least one ID event: 22 (38.6%) viral (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, one (1.8%) fungal and 16 (28.1%) probable infections. Most ID events affected the respiratory tract (25, 37.3%) or the urinary tract (13, 19.4%). Pathogen types and infection sites were similar in PWH and a matched control group of HIV-uninfected patients. HIV was not an independent risk factor for ID events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94,  By linking data from two large national Swiss cohorts, we provided in-depth information on ID events in PWH receiving a K-Tx in Switzerland. HIV infection was not associated with an increased hazard for ID events after K-Tx. In a matched analysis based on longitudinal data from the Swiss HIV and Transplant Cohort Studies including all people with HIV who received a kidney transplantation, HIV was not an independent risk factor for infectious disease events post-transplant.","Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk to experience life-threatening infectious disease (ID) events post-transplant [ For a long time, an HIV infection was considered a contraindication for receiving a SOT. However, since implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) and continuous improvement of care for people with HIV (PWH) leading to a recovery of the immune system, transplantation in PWH became a valuable option for treatment of end-stage organ disease. The patient and graft survival was shown to be comparable to people without HIV [ In this study, we linked data collected in two representative nation-wide cohort studies in Switzerland, the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). Our main study hypothesis was that kidney transplant recipients with HIV are more prone to ID events after transplantation as compared to kidney transplant recipients without HIV. Hence, our main aim was to compare the occurrence of ID events with a matched control group of HIV-uninfected kidney transplant recipients. Further, we aimed to provide a comprehensive characterisation of ID events in kidney transplant recipients with HIV including detailed information on HIV-specific parameters, such as ART regimen and viral loads. The Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), a multicentric cohort study established in 2008, covers information on more than 93% of all solid organ transplant recipients in Switzerland [ The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) is a nationwide longitudinal cohort study enrolling adult people with HIV (PWH) living in Switzerland. The cohort study was established in 1988 and covers approximately 70% of all people ever diagnosed with HIV in Switzerland, with cumulatively more than 21’000 participants [ All PWH with a K-Tx between 2008 and 2022 registered in the SHCS were identified and linked with the respective study identifier in the STCS, in order to obtain detailed information on both, HIV-related parameters and transplant-related parameters. Linkage was performed using the birthdate, transplantation date and further demographic and clinical variables available in both cohort studies. For unclear cases, the treating physician was consulted, and the original medical chart was revised, leading to an unambiguous link for all cases. All cases with a minimal follow-up of at least 30 days after transplantation were included in the analysis. To understand the impact of an HIV infection on the occurrence of ID events, we matched a comparison group of people without HIV: we first identified all STCS participants who underwent a kidney transplantation at the age of 18 or older, with a follow-up of at least 30 days after transplantation. Further, we removed all PWH from this population (the participants already matched with the SHCS, as well as 4 individuals with HIV but not registered in the SHCS). We then matched a control group with a 1:3 ratio based on age at transplantation, sex, and calendar year of transplantation. Sex was defined as biological sex assigned at birth and categorised as male or female. Ethnicity was grouped into Caucasian, African, or Asian. Age was reported as a continuous variable in Table  
 Demographic and clinical information about the study population STCS: Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, IQR: interquartile range, DBD: donation after brain death, DCD: donation after cardiocirculatory death, ATG: Anti-thymocyte globulin, MMF: Mycophenolate mofetil, EC-MPS: Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium, ART antiretroviral therapy We used R Studio (version 4.3.1) for all analyses and visualisation of the timeline for ID events. The observation time starts at the day of transplantation until the last follow-up information. The matched control group was generated by randomly choosing three patients from the potential control group (i.e., HIV-uninfected, same sex, same transplantation year, difference in age at transplantation being less than 3 years) using the R function  We identified 24 PWH who received a K-Tx in Switzerland since 2008 (Table  Overall, 57 ID events were reported for 17 (70.8%) patients: 22 (38.6%) viral infections (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, 16 (28.1%) probable infections and one probable fungal infection (see Fig.

 Pathogen types and infections site of all infectious disease events reported for people with HIV receiving a kidney transplantation. Potentially opportunistic infections are indicated with * The matched control group ( In this study, we provide a comprehensive description of a representative sample of PWH receiving K-Tx in Switzerland in the years 2008 until 2022. Using the strength of two nation-wide longitudinal prospective cohort studies, one enrolling people receiving solid organ transplantations and one enrolling PWH, we were able to provide a detailed description of infectious complications post-transplant (recorded in the STCS) as well as HIV-specific clinical information (recorded in the SHCS). The main finding is that despite the potential detrimental effect of the chronic HIV infection on the immune system at the time of transplantation, PWH did not experience higher rates of infectious complications. The pathogen types and infection sites were mostly comparable, even when restricting to infections requiring hospitalisation or potentially opportunistic infections, respectively. At the time of transplantation, the median CD4 cell count was 385 cells/mm In the present study, viral infections were the most common ID events in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. In the subset of ID events requiring hospitalisation, bacterial infections predominated. This finding is in line with prior studies reporting a large proportion of bacterial infections among ID events requiring hospitalisation or even intensive care support of kidney transplant recipients with HIV [ In the comparison of causative pathogens, BKPyV infections were more frequent in the HIV-negative control group, the reasons for this difference being unclear. Among polyomaviruses, JC virus (JCPyV) infections with the clinical presentation of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is most often seen in PWH [ A survival benefit for PWH with end-stage renal disease who received a K-Tx has been previously reported [ Strengths of the present study are the multi-centric design and the use of prospective, comprehensive data collection of two cohort studies. Both cohort studies share a large degree of representability for Switzerland. In particular, the STCS includes basic information on all solid organ transplantations in Switzerland since 2008, with a consent rate of 93% for reusing the information for research purposes [ Our findings strengthen the current guidelines of HIV not being a contraindication for transplantation. Evaluation of PWH for K-Tx seemed to differ from HIV-uninfected patients with end stage kidney disease, e.g. all PWH received renal replacement prior to K-Tx, whereas in the control group several pre-emptive K-Tx were performed. A harmonisation in evaluation strategies between PWH and HIV-uninfected patients should be considered. Further research and a higher sample size is needed to understand potentially yet unrevealed differences in ID events after transplantation in PWH compared to HIV-uninfected patients. Linkage of national transplantation registries and HIV cohorts are crucial to obtain these insights.","['Kidney transplantation', 'HIV', 'Infectious disease events']",2024-10-11,BMC Infectious Diseases,AIDS
11470572,How to improve drought resilience to guarantee regional sustainable development,"Drought is a pressing environmental issue with profound socio-economic impacts. Frequent drought disasters around the world have brought huge impacts and challenges, severely constraining the sustainable development of cities. How to improve drought resilience to guarantee regional sustainable development has become a hot research topic. In this study, we developed a comprehensive framework to assess drought resilience in China, analyzing its spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, uncovering the underlying impact mechanisms, and projecting future resilience trends across different regions of the country. Over the past 12 years, the average drought resilience level in China has risen by 14.4 %. Central and eastern coastal provinces demonstrated higher resilience levels, contrasting with the western inland regions' lower resilience. A significant positive spatial correlation was observed in China's drought resilience, with high-value clusters emerging in the southeastern and northeastern regions. Among the sub-resilience dimensions, social resilience had the most substantial impact. The prediction model suggests that the drought resilience level will increase modestly by 6.2 % across provinces, maintaining the spatial pattern of higher resilience in the eastern coastal areas and the southern and northern extremities, with lower resilience in the central region. Our findings underscore the significance of understanding regional variations in drought resilience to inform targeted and efficient policy interventions. We developed a “social-economic-environmental-institutional” drought resilience assessment framework. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity characteristics of drought resilience in China are analyzed. The sub-resiliences that affect China's drought resistance and their action paths are discussed. We discussed how to improve drought resilience to guarantee regional sustainable development strategies.","The authors declare no competing financial interest. Drought is an intricate natural disaster that has profound impacts on agriculture [ Owing to the intricacy and multifaceted nature of drought risk, it cannot be characterized solely by singular indicators like insufficient rainfall [ Research into urban resilience is instrumental in addressing drought challenges. Urban resilience is defined as the capacity of a city to resist and/or adapt to specific disturbances, reinstating its typical functions or equilibrium state [ In this study, we established a drought resilience assessment framework based on ""Social-Economic-Environmental-Institutional"" dimensions. Grounded in this framework, the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method was employed to measure China's drought resilience, with the Theil index being used to analyze its spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Subsequently, the Global Moran's index and Getis-Ord Gi∗ Index were employed to elucidate the dependency and hotspot regions of China's drought resilience. Further, the influence of sub-resilience on drought resilience was explored utilizing a structural equation model. For the upcoming 14 years, the BP neural network was meticulously employed to project the intricate trends and potential shifts in drought resilience. Through this research, we addressed the following questions: (1) What is the degree of drought resilience in China? (2) What is the nature of the spatial-temporal heterogeneity and dependency of drought resilience? (3) How does sub-resilience influence China's drought resilience? (4) What are the potential alterations in China's drought resilience over the next 14 years? We aspire that these profound studies and discoveries will foster the refinement and updating of strategies, concentrating on holistically enhancing drought resilience and diminishing provincial disparities, thereby offering a replicable blueprint for the global arena. China, situated in East Asia and spanning approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, is a nation characterized by its intricate and diverse geographical landscapes. Notably, regions in the northwest, such as Xinjiang and Qinghai, despite their vast expanses, have a relatively sparse population due to their arid climatic conditions. In contrast, the eastern coastal regions, blessed with a humid climate, are not only densely populated but also economically prosperous ( The study area of China. Drought disasters have imparted significant adverse impacts on societies, severely impeding urban sustainable development. Enhancing urban resilience against drought to foster sustainable growth has emerged as a focal point of research. China frequently grapples with severe droughts, leading to substantial economic losses. Evaluating the drought resistance capabilities of various Chinese provinces and discerning the influencing factors aids the government in the judicious allocation of disaster relief funds, bolstering regional disaster resilience to promote regional sustainable development. To investigate how to improve drought resilience to guarantee regional sustainable development, this study introduces an assessment framework for drought resistance capabilities based on ""Social-Economic-Environmental-Institutional"" ( The method framework for this study. In this study, indicators were preliminarily selected from various aspects, including economic level, environment, institution, and social factors. During the initial development of the comprehensive evaluation index system for drought resilience, a large number of indicators were pre-selected, and basic data spanning 12 years were collected. Correlation analysis was then conducted on these pre-selected indicators. Relevant tests were performed using SPSS 20.0 software to examine the constructed assessment index system, aiming to eliminate redundant evaluation indicators that reflect similar information. Consequently, under the premise of aligning with urban resilience and disaster resilience theories, the most feasible indicators were screened to establish a drought resilience system evaluation framework. A total of 23 evaluation indicators were selected for the drought resilience assessment system ( Evaluation index system of drought resilience. This section employs the entropy weighted-TOPSIS approach for a comprehensive evaluation of drought resilience and sub-resilience in China. Developed by Hwang and Masud [ Establish the matrix X, which is an n∗m matrix representing n provinces and m indicators. To eliminate the influence of different variable magnitudes and units, all indicator variables were subjected to a process of standardization. Due to the varying impacts of different indicators on the outcome, two different methods of standardization were employed. Transform matrix X into a trend-consistent matrix  Use the entropy weight method to determine the weights  Determine the positive and negative ideal solutions based on the matrix. Calculate the Euclidean distance between each indicator value and the ideal solution. Calculate the closeness degree between each evaluation object and the ideal solution. We examine the spatial autocorrelation of drought resilience in China using the global Moran index. Spatial autocorrelation is an essential method for studying spatial distribution. Spatial autocorrelation statistics reflect the potential level of dependence among elements with different geographical locations [ The formula for calculating Moran's I is as follows: When the absolute value of the  The Getis-Ord Gi∗ index is called “hot and cold analysis” and used to identify high- and low-value clusters of spatial unit elements [ The formula for calculation is as follows: If the  Theil index is initially proposed based on information theory and generated from generalized entropy measure [ In this study, an exploratory structural equation model (ESEM) was employed to analyze the interaction between drought resilience in China and subdomain resilience. It is also known as Covariance Structure Modeling. Structural equation model (SEM) can examine the relationships between latent variables and observed variables, as well as the causal relationships within latent variable paths, measuring the degree of influence between variables or the effects of variables [ The AMOS 24 software is utilized in this study to construct the model and conduct measurement analysis [ The backpropagation neural network is the most successful and extensively used artificial neural network [ We take a three-layer (including one hidden layer) backpropagation (BP) network as an example to introduce ( Input layer to hidden layer: Hidden layer to output layer: model: However, given the limited sample size in predicting drought resilience levels, the resulting predictions may not be highly convincing. To improve the reliability of these predictions, it's crucial to assess the model's performance. Cross-validation is particularly useful in such cases, especially when the dataset is small. The 5-fold Cross-Validation method is commonly used in machine learning and data mining to evaluate model accuracy [ The specified geographical scope for data collection in this study is the 30 provincial-level administrative regions of China, excluding Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. The research time frame selected for analysis spans from 2010 to 2021. The specific indicators are derived from China City Statistical Yearbook ( The average drought resilience score for the 30 provinces in China is 0.00278, indicating a moderate level of resilience ( Spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of drought resilience: (a) spatial distribution characteristics; (b) trend chart of drought resilience index; (c) distribution map of drought resilience density. This paper analyzed the spatial distribution of drought resilience and used the average of drought resilience natural breakpoints in 2010, 2015 and 2021 as our classification criteria ( Spatial distribution characteristics of drought resilience in China over time. Provinces in the eastern region of China manifest remarkable resilience ( By further utilizing the weights of various drought resilience indicators, we can obtain scores for SR, EcoR, IR and EnvR in different regions of China ( Sub-resilience levels of China's four major regions. The overall difference in drought resilience among provinces in China has widened over the years ( Regional differences of drought resilience: (a) change trend of Theil index; (b) change trend of contribution rate. As shown in  Global Moran index of drought resilience. The Moran's I serves as a crucial indicator to assess the spatial dependency of China's Drought Resilience Index. From 2010 to 2021, all Chinese provinces exhibited a global spatial autocorrelation in their drought resilience. To identify hotspots and coldspots of drought resilience, the Getis-Ord Gi∗ method was employed, illustrating the clustering pattern across provinces during this period ( Cold and hot spots pattern of drought resilience. The analysis detected low-value clusters in the northwest and southwest regions, while high-value clusters were identified in the southeast and northeast regions. The number of provinces with high-value clusters has changed from year to year, increasing from three in 2010 to five in 2014 and decreasing to three in 2021. Conversely, the number of low-value clusters remained constant throughout the study. Spatial correlation revealed that the northeast region initially lacked high-value clusters, but by 2014, Heilongjiang and Jilin became hotspot areas, with Heilongjiang as the primary hotspot. In the southeast region, the hotspot range fluctuated, with only Jiangxi consistently identified as a high-value cluster, though its correlation with neighboring provinces decreased. The low-value correlation in the western region experienced an initial increase followed by a decrease. Qinghai and Sichuan remained primary coldspot areas throughout the study period, while the low-value correlation in other provinces fluctuated. Considering the changing characteristics of coldspot and hotspot distribution locations and ranges, the focus of drought resilience research during the study period should be on the western region. Additionally, attention should be paid to the rapid decline in high-value correlation in the southeast region in recent years. In this study, we employed SEM to analyze the impact of various sub-resilience factors on overall drought resilience in China. Specifically, the model included some manifest variables representing the latent constructs of economic, social, environmental, and institutional resilience. The manifest variables for economic resilience (EcoR) included the proportion of agriculture in GDP (X1) and GDP per capita (X2), reflecting the region's economic capacity to withstand and recover from drought. For social resilience ( The results of SEM model: (a) Interaction between drought resilience and sub-domain resilience; (b) Interaction within sub-domain resilience (∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001). The measurement results indicate that all sub-resilience factors have a positive influence on drought resilience. The path coefficients for EcoR, EnvR, IR, and SR on drought resilience are 0.641, 0.312, 0.496, and 0.487, respectively. Based on the analysis, all four paths between Chinese drought resilience and sub-resilience are significant at the level of p < 0.001, reflecting the positive and significant impacts of the sub-resilience factors on drought resilience. The structural equation model depicting the interactions among the sub-resilience factors is presented in  There are a total of six paths in the model, with four of them reaching a significance level of 0.05. Specifically, EnvR has a direct influence on IR and SR, with standardized path coefficients of 0.632 and −0.192. SR and IR have a direct influence on EcoR, with standardized path coefficients of 0.308 and −0.233. Based on the interactions within the sub-resilience factors, IR and SR mediate the effects of economic and EnvR. The total effects of each sub-resilience factor on drought resilience are illustrated in  The total effect of sub-resilience on drought resilience. As shown in  Dynamic simulation results of drought resilience level from 2022 to 2035. Throughout the forecast period, a majority of Chinese provinces are categorized under Level I and Level II resilience tiers. Notably, western regions grapple with lower resilience, particularly in the initial stages. Yet, provinces such as Yunnan, Gansu, and Sichuan in the western sector exhibit remarkable progress, possibly influenced by higher inherent resilience in central areas and reduced pandemic impact. In contrast, drought resilience in the eastern regions remains relatively steady, marked by minor fluctuations. In essence, China's overall drought resilience continues to be influenced by the lingering effects of the pandemic, resulting in a relatively modest level of resilience. Amongst the geographical divisions, the western region stands out with the lowest resilience, while the northeastern region boasts consistently high average resilience. Heilongjiang in the northeast maintains a remarkable Level V resilience. The central and eastern regions remain basically unchanged, with select provinces noting slight enhancements and others witnessing marginal declines. In this study, regarding drought resilience levels prediction, the BP neural network model demonstrated exceptional performance ( Further, a 3D map of the predicted drought resilience levels from 2022 to 2035 was generated in this study using the trend analysis tool in ArcGIS 10.5. Visualized as scatter plots projected onto the X-Y plane (longitude and latitude) with varying heights (Z-axis),  Trend lines of China's drought resilience levels. Amid the escalating dynamics of global climate change, the future water cycle and hydrological processes are undergoing transformation [ Enhancing drought resilience becomes paramount in the context of climate change. For China's regional sustainable development, amplifying drought resilience signifies an augmented capacity to confront climatic challenges, ensuring stable resource provisions and fostering favorable conditions for future advancement [ Firstly, strengthen economic and technological support from eastern affluent regions to western provinces. Given the challenges in rapidly improving economic infrastructure in Western provinces, it is crucial for the more developed Eastern regions to increase their economic and technological investments in these areas. This includes funding infrastructure projects that can enhance the resilience of  Secondly, establish disaster monitoring platforms and increase public awareness. The establishment of disaster-monitoring platforms that aggregate crowd-sourced data is essential. These platforms can enable governmental agencies to accurately pinpoint affected areas during disasters and assess the severity of the impact, thereby improving response efforts. Public awareness campaigns on emergency management should be intensified to educate the populace about disaster preparedness. Encouraging proactive disaster monitoring and information-sharing among citizens can significantly enhance the overall resilience and recovery capabilities of communities [ Furthermore, accelerate the optimization of resource allocation to boost drought resilience. Targeted investments in infrastructure and ecological protection are necessary to enhance the drought resilience of Western provinces. These investments should prioritize projects that improve water management, soil conservation, and ecological restoration, thereby reducing the regions' vulnerability to drought [ Establish drought resilience research and technology centers in high-resilience provinces. High-resilience provinces, particularly in the central region, should establish drought resilience research and technology centers. These centers can provide technical expertise, develop innovative solutions, and offer policy recommendations to help other provinces enhance their drought resilience. Long-term planning is essential to address the complex interplay between pandemic impacts and drought resilience. These plans should include provisions for increased support to affected regions, ensuring that they have the capacity to withstand and recover from both droughts and pandemic-related disruptions [ Foster inter-provincial collaboration to enhance overall drought resilience. Collaboration among provinces, particularly between the Northeast, Central, and Eastern regions, should be strengthened. This can involve creating formal mechanisms for resource sharing, joint disaster response initiatives, and collaborative research efforts aimed at improving drought resilience across regions [ In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework to assess drought resilience based on ""Social-Economic-Environmental-Institutional"" dimensions in China, analyzing its spatiotemporal evolution characteristics, uncovering the underlying impact mechanisms, and projecting future resilience trends across different regions of the country. 30 provinces in China are used as the study area for research discussions and results analysis. The main conclusions are as follows. The overall level of drought resilience in China exhibited an upward trend from 2010 to 2021. The rate of improvement in drought resilience was relatively rapid during the first decade, but it slowed down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, resulting in no change in resilience that year. In 2021, there was a slight increase in drought resilience. From a spatial perspective, there is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in drought resilience across China, with high-value clusters emerging in the southeastern and northeastern regions. The central and eastern coastal provinces exhibit relatively high levels of drought resilience, while the western inland regions show lower resilience, indicating distinct regional disparities. All sub-resilience factors positively influence drought resilience. The path coefficients for EcoR, EnvR, IR, and SR on drought resilience are 0.641, 0.312, 0.496, and 0.487, respectively. Based on the interactions among sub-resilience factors, IR and SR mediate the impact of EcoR and EnvR. Drought resilience is primarily influenced by SR and EcoR, followed by IR, with EnvR showing the least impact. The level of drought resilience in China is projected to continue its upward trend from 2022 to 2035. However, in the early years, the improvement in drought resilience across provinces is expected to be slow due to the lingering effects of the pandemic. The western region will continue to have the lowest drought resilience, although provinces like Yunnan, Gansu, and Sichuan in the west are expected to show significant improvement. The eastern region is expected to maintain relatively stable levels of drought resilience. In terms of spatial development trends, significant differences in drought resilience are evident in both the east-west and north-south directions, with a general pattern of ""higher in the east and lower in the west."" In the later years, the north-south differences are expected to remain stable, with minimal changes. This research aims to identify the resilience and spatial variations of Chinese provincial-level administrative regions concerning drought. The findings shed light on regions in China that currently and in the future require attention regarding drought resilience, emphasizing the significance of social and institutional systems in enhancing drought resilience. These issues not only concern China but also affect the sustainable development of all countries worldwide. A deeper understanding of regional drought resilience is crucial for safeguarding precious water resources, optimizing ecosystems, and providing scientific guidance for sustainable agricultural and socio-economic development. Only through in-depth research into drought resilience can we better confront the threat of drought posed by climate change, thus ensuring societal safety and economic sustainability.

This integration will result in an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable energy system known as a smart grid. The  Smart grid (traditional electric power grid from an electro-mechanically controlled system to an electronically controlled network). SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) functions as a controlling system and a network for communications within a smart electricity system [ Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems can utilize either point-to-point or mesh communication architectures, allowing for local communication in close proximity or across longer distances [ Smart meters are modern energy measurement devices utilized in households or businesses to gather data on electricity consumption from various devices. They analyze consumer energy usage, provide valuable information to utility companies or system operators, and enhance monitoring capabilities while streamlining billing processes. Smart meters monitor electrical parameters such as voltage and frequency, capturing real-time energy consumption data. They establish a connection between the residence or business and the smart grid, enabling bidirectional information and energy transfer. By facilitating two-way communication, smart meters establish a link between the meter and the central system, typically managed by the utility company or system operator [ Undoubtedly, smart metering has received significant attention recently. Numerous countries, both inside and outside the EU, are already working on smart metering programs at the demonstration or larger scale. Smart meters are widely said to have several advantages, which are covered in depth in Ref. [ Global smart meter investments increased to 13 billion in 2018, with 800 million smart-meters installed worldwide before the year is through, as illustrated in  Global annual smart meter investment. A modern electrical distribution system, referred to as a “smart grid,” incorporates advanced technologies such as sensors, communication networks, and analytics to enhance the efficiency, flexibility, and reliability of the grid. The smart grid comprises seven key components: Market Support, Demand Response (DR), Distribution Automation (DA), Communications, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Electric Vehicles (EVs), Renewable Energy Integration (REI), Energy Storage, and cybersecurity. The implementation of smart meters, renewable energy sources, automation, electric vehicles, demand response, energy storage, and strong cybersecurity features are necessary for the development and success of a smart grid [ Seven domain in smart grid. Designing custom control systems that are significantly smaller, more dependable, and have better long-term support is now achievable for managing the traditional electric grid. This advancement is made possible by leveraging open-source initiatives and technologies like System-in-Package (SiP), which enables these systems to be as affordable and timely to deploy as conventional rack and stack solutions. Silicon Power Corporation's InnovaTM SCM21001 system-on-module (SoM) was developed as an embedded computing platform primarily for electric grid automation applications. The SCM21001 SoM integrates a real-time DSP subsystem with Octavo Systems' OSD3358 SiP, a Texas Instruments dual-core DSP, and an Intel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). It also includes a Linux-based management controller. This single SoM optimizes DSP systems using conventional DSP and FPGA techniques, alongside management and monitoring software offering contemporary communication protocols and user interfaces.

Therefore, ensuring the security and reliable performance of the grid requires a tiered strategy for smart grid cyber-physical security. In the study by Ref. [ Cyber attack classification of smart grid. Cyberattacks targeting smart grids pose a significant threat to the stability, reliability, privacy, and security of electrical grids and consumers. Understanding the various types of cyberattacks is crucial for developing robust cybersecurity strategies. The  Cyber-attacks in smart grids. Real-time grid status monitoring is made possible by the control center's advanced monitoring and control technologies. These technologies can promptly identify system flaws or disturbances and take corrective action. Additionally, they can assess grid utilization levels and adjust power levels as necessary to maintain stability and effectiveness. The smart grid (SG) consists of three primary components: Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT), and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) [ OT describes the physical components and operational activities of industrial infrastructure controlled and monitored by hardware and software [ The AMI framework facilitates communication among the SG control server, aggregators, and power consumers. AMI devices include smart meters, V2G devices, PMUs, MDMSs, DCs, and SDCs [ Smart grid devices. A deliberate introduction, modification, or removal of data or control commands within network traffic constitutes a “data attack,” aimed at causing the smart grid to make erroneous decisions or behave inappropriately. Manipulating a smart meter to reduce power costs often leads to a data breach. Similarly, a compromised Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) may detect an issue through a faulty circuit indicator (FCI) device but deliberately refrain from notifying the control center, prolonging the outage. Protecting data integrity and authenticity, along with developing effective intrusion detection techniques, are crucial defenses against such attacks [ Network availability attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), aim to exhaust or overload the smart grid's com-munication and computing capabilities, causing delays or failures in data communications. For instance, adversaries may flood a control center with repetitive requests, inundating it with inaccurate information and preventing it from promptly responding to legitimate network traffic. In the context of the smart grid, where timely and accurate data are crucial for effective operation, even a brief delay can have severe consequences for homeland security and the national economy. Addressing network availability attacks requires effective and strategic mitigation measures [ A privacy attack aims to obtain or infer private information about individuals by analyzing energy usage data. Smart meters in smart grids collect power usage data multiple times per hour to monitor grid status and improve operational efficiency. This detailed information can inadvertently reveal customers’ physical activities. For example, prolonged periods without power consumption from appliances like stoves and microwaves may indicate that a household is unoccupied, potentially facilitating targeted criminal activities such as burglaries. Safeguarding such sensitive data from unauthorized access is paramount [ Customizing a machine learning technique like Support Vector Machines (SVM) enables the identification of potential attacks within devices before they occur. Additionally, TFPG, a mechanism for analyzing attack paths, is employed to discover these paths. During experiments, it was found that the SVM classifier requires shorter training times compared to a Neural Network (NN) classifier, while effectively and accurately detecting attacks on smart meters. A real-time Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) model is provided by a maximum likelihood estimator based on observations of parameters such as power flow, voltage magnitudes, or phase angles. Through extensive training using a diverse set of both normal and abnormal IDS events, the SVM learning model can effectively distinguish between abnormal and normal occurrences in FDI assaults [ Denial of service (DoS) is an attack type where attackers try to unavailable data and information for the desired users by attacking the server of the smart grid.  This type of attack can be in the layer of the smart grid. DoS mainly try to collapse all of the communication layer first and then it tries to make physical, data link layer, transportation layer etc in their control. DoS attacks all of the segment of the SG [ [ DoS attack in SG in terms of (a) communication protocol, (b) Networking layer, (C) power grid application [ A data attack aims to maliciously introduce, delete, or modify data or control commands within network traffic to induce incorrect judgments or actions in the smart grid (SG). For instance, attackers may manipulate smart meters to reduce electricity bills [ Machine learning-based techniques for detecting data anomalies have become widely adopted in cyber-attack detection. According to Cui et al. [ Conventional residual-based techniques for detecting bad data are limited in their ability to identify risks arising from the injection of fake data (FDI). The method proposed in Ref. [ Architectural overview and signal flow graph proposed in Ref. [ According to Ref. [ In a related approach to uncovering anomalies in power usage [ Another approach to identify FDIA is presented in Ref. [ The concept of graph signal processing models smart grids as graphs, where nodes represent different grid components and edges represent interconnections. Each component is associated with a signal such as voltage or current readings, enabling comprehensive analysis of the grid's behavior. Hackers with malicious intent can manipulate SCADA readings by injecting biased values into sensor-collected measurements, aiming to deceive bad-data detectors during state estimation. This manipulation could lead to incorrect control decisions that compromise the smart grid's security, causing financial losses, network disruptions, or both. In older systems, a bad data detector (BDD) evaluates the accuracy of sensor-acquired measurement data. Recent findings highlight the stealthy cyber-attack (SCA) described in Ref. [ The algorithm described operates on a data-driven approach, eliminating the need for specific model or system parameters. This contrasts with model-based detection algorithms, which rely heavily on precise system characteristics that, if unclear or inaccurate, can significantly impact their performance [ In the context of privacy attacks targeting electricity usage data, smart meters deployed in smart grids collect detailed information about power consumption multiple times per hour, potentially revealing sensitive information such as occupants’ daily routines. Detecting data leakage from usage patterns is crucial in this scenario. Traditional occupancy detection systems typically rely on specialized sensors like cameras, magnetic reed switches, or passive infrared (PIR) sensors. Recent research, however, explores the use of digital power meters, widely installed in millions of homes worldwide, as effective occupancy sensors [ An adversary can be misled by a honeypot deployed on a network, tricking them into believing a simulated system is an actual power grid infrastructure. Within a virtualized environment, this honeypot gathers intelligence on the attacker's behavior, functioning as a countermeasure that forces the attacker to expend resources attempting to breach the honeypot ecosystem. However, most honeypot systems traditionally employ static defense tactics, which pose challenges in dealing with dynamic threats. Moreover, attackers can easily circumvent a honeypot by detecting the artificial environment, such as through anti-honeypot techniques like those observed in Singapore. Alternatively, a dynamic Bayesian honeypot game model serves as a deterrent against attackers aiming to execute dynamic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) [ The application of a game theory framework, utilizing tree-structured analysis, provides significant advantages in efficiently allocating resources within the smart grid (SG) and formulating appropriate defense scenarios. This framework focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of specific attack strategies. It utilizes the tree-structured model to illustrate various attack paths, demonstrating multiple attack methods [ SG is susceptible to cyberattacks targeting Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations since the infrastructure for charging electric vehicles (EVs) is built on the SG [ Smart meter transmissions can be secured through encryption methods, where the encryption key plays a crucial role. Proper management of encryption keys within the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) network is essential, particularly when dealing with numerous meters between nodes. In their article, the authors propose a practical paradigm for key management to ensure secure smart meter communication. They also introduce an effective technique for generating new keys and modifying existing ones, addressing both time and space complexities. Data integrity attacks, particularly false data injection (FDI) and bad data injection (BDD) attacks, are among the most worrisome types of data assaults. We talked about detecting methods in the previous part, and now we're going to suggest some defense methods that can lessen data attacks. In the realm of machine learning, ‘concept drift’ refers to sudden changes in the underlying distribution of past data over time, indicating abrupt shifts in the data characteristics [ In [ The Multi-Agent System (MAS)-based rule-based intrusion detection approach proposed in Ref. [ Overall, the integration of multi-agent systems and advanced classification algorithms represents a significant advancement in enhancing the security and resilience of cyber-physical energy systems, offering robust protection against evolving cyber threats. In addressing the challenge of defending against fake data injection attacks in smart grid networks, a non-Bayesian framework known as the CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) test has emerged as a promising solution. Unlike Bayesian methods, the CUSUM test detects changes in distributions from known to unknown at random intervals, making it adaptable to varying temporal distributions and unknown patterns. An adaptive CUSUM algorithm has been proposed specifically to mitigate fake data injection assaults within smart grid networks. This approach involves two phases integrated into the smart grid state estimation system, as illustrated in the diagram referenced in Ref. [ In [ To address the challenge of mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in smart grids, a multifaceted approach integrating various techniques is essential, as highlighted in Ref. [ Integrating these techniques forms a robust defense mechanism against DoS attacks in smart grids, combining technical and non-technical approaches to bolster cybersecurity defenses comprehensively. Addressing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in smart grids requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates various techniques to bolster cybersecurity defenses. Rate limiting is one such technique aimed at reducing network traffic, which can aid in detecting and mitigating DoS attacks. This can be implemented at perimeter devices like reverse firewalls and logically on server machines [ Solution techniques for DoS attacks in smart grid. Smart meters are increasingly replacing traditional electromechanical ones because of their numerous advantages. They can adjust load for demand response, develop relationships between utility services and end users, and save energy. However, while smart meters offer fine-grained usage data, this also creates new vulnerabilities for both customers and companies. One such instance of privacy violation is occupancy detection. Given the close relationship between occupancy and power use, detecting a home's occupancy is straightforward using time-of-use data. An effective countermeasure, the AMLODA model, is presented in Ref. [ Smart meters unintentionally reveal private data about a home's occupancy, which may be easily found because it strongly corresponds with fundamental statistical measures like the mean, variance, and range of power. Recent research [ In the examination of cybersecurity measures within smart grid infrastructures, a comprehensive understanding of detection and defense methods against cyber attacks is crucial.  Detection and defense methods of cyber attacks in smart grid. In the next section, we present  Cyber attacks in smart grids: Author, dataset, detection method, Defence method, main contribution, result. Electricity users can actively participate thanks to the self-healing capabilities of smart grids. Smart grid technologies are self-healing systems that reduce the burden and strive to provide all users with sustainable, dependable, and high-quality power and can quickly identify solutions to problems in an existing system [ Excluding production-related grids such as Transmission, Distribution, and Micro, the smart grid's power system comprises three basic grids. A shorter self-healing time in the network leads to reduced energy reserves and a limited timeframe for system regeneration. Wide area monitoring, protection, and control (WAMPAC) utilize the intuitive algorithm-based design of the integer linear programming (ILP) model to safeguard against cyberattacks, incorporating cryptography, access control, and firewalls. This approach is crucial in protecting the smart grid from cyberattacks by facilitating self-healing mechanisms, such as the reconnection of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and the restoration of system observability [ Self-Healing of smart grid. A smart grid represents a modernized electrical system that integrates advanced information and communication technologies to enhance the efficiency and reliability of power distribution. The extent of connectivity and reliance of the smart grid on the internet and other communication networks directly correlates with its vulnerability to potential attacks.  Future direction. Blockchain, a distributed and immutable ledger, offers a transparent and secure way to store information about transactions. In the context of smart grids, it can be applied to ensure safe data flow across different nodes and reduce the possibility of cyberattacks. Additionally, AI algorithms can be used to identify irregularities in the system and alert operators to any security breaches. IoT devices can monitor for cyberattacks and collect data from the grid. IoT sensors have the capacity to recognize changes in the system and notify operators of any hazards. Predictive analytics may be used to identify trends and patterns in a system and foresee possible online dangers. This technology enables operators to prevent intrusions before they begin. Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide various forms of identity as a security measure before they can access a system. With this technology, the smart grid can be secured so that only authorized individuals can access it. Securing the future smart grid requires a comprehensive approach, integrating various advanced technologies to address the dynamic landscape of cyber threats. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, stands as a foundational element, ensuring the integrity of data and transactions within the smart grid. This not only provides a secure means of storing information but also establishes transparency in data transfer, reducing the susceptibility to cyberattacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the smart grid's cybersecurity posture. AI algorithms are adept at swiftly identifying anomalies and potential security breaches within the system. By continuously analyzing data, AI systems can detect unusual patterns or behaviors, enabling quick responses to mitigate emerging threats. This dynamic threat detection capability significantly enhances the resilience of the smart grid against a wide array of cyber risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) is another crucial component in fortifying the smart grid's defenses. IoT devices, strategically deployed throughout the grid infrastructure, act as vigilant sensors, collecting real-time data on grid performance. These devices can identify system changes and promptly alert operators to potential cyber threats. The seamless integration of IoT technology thus provides enhanced situational awareness, enabling proactive measures to safeguard against unforeseen risks. Predictive analytics is a proactive method for foreseeing and averting possible cyber risks. Predictive analytics forecasts future cyber risks before they occur by studying past data and finding trends. By enabling operators to take preemptive action, this proactive strategy improves the overall security posture of the smart grid. In addition to these technologies, multi-factor authentication serves as a robust access control mechanism. This ensures that only authorized users with verified identities can access the smart grid, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches. By embracing a multifaceted approach that incorporates blockchain, AI, IoT, predictive analytics, and robust access control measures, the future smart grid can establish a resilient cybersecurity framework. This amalgamation of technologies not only addresses current vulnerabilities but also prepares the smart grid for emerging threats, ensuring the reliable and secure operation of critical infrastructure. In conclusion, modern technology will be required for the smart grid of the future to ensure cybersecurity. Several technologies, including blockchain, AI, IoT, predictive analytics, and multi-factor authentication, will be utilized to safeguard the smart grid from online dangers. Ensuring the security of smart grid networks is crucial and plays an essential role in facilitating the widespread adoption of smart grid technologies. Previous studies have highlighted a limited focus on assessing cybersecurity options for smart grid networks. This article aims to address the gaps in prior research by providing a comprehensive analysis of potential attacks on smart grids and a comparative evaluation of security approaches. In this work, we propose a comparison of the integrity, availability, confidentiality, and impact of cyberattacks. Additionally, we introduce a new classification of cyber attacks and broadly describe their detection and defense techniques. However, a key limitation of this paper lies in its broad characterization of cybersecurity options and the comparative evaluation of security approaches for smart grid networks. While advocating for innovative approaches, the paper lacks specificity in addressing the nuanced strengths and weaknesses of existing strategies. This limits the depth of proposed solutions, suggesting the need for future research to delve into the practical implementation and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures. This study underscores the necessity for innovative approaches that comprehensively address security concerns in smart grid infrastructures while maintaining operational efficiency and reliability.

11470501,Heat stress tolerance in wheat seedling: Clustering genotypes and identifying key traits using multivariate analysis,"Elevated atmospheric heat is considered as one of the bottlenecks for global wheat production. Screening potential wheat genotypes against heat stress and selecting some suitable indicators to assist in understanding thermotolerance could be crucial for sustaining wheat cultivation. Accordingly, 80 diverse bread wheat genotypes were evaluated in controlled lab condition by imposing a week-long heat stress (35/25 ","The world's food production is under constant risk due to the introduction of climate change associated with rising in atmospheric temperature. In a high-emission scenario, the mean global temperature is expected to increase by 3.3–5.7 °C by the end of the 21st century [ Among the cereals, the production of bread wheat ( Heat stress during early growth can hinder seedling development by disrupting enzymatic activity involved in seed metabolism. Additionally, the elevated abscisic acid level and reduced gibberellin activity due to heat stress inhibit seed germination and delays the germination process, respectively [ High temperature alters the expression and activity of transporter proteins involved in nutrient absorption and transport, and damage the vascular tissue system, resulting in nutrient deficiencies and stunted growth [ Heat stress also brings about reduction in chlorophyll content and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [ For exploring relationships, grouping, and selecting traits from a complex data set, multivariate analysis techniques are essential. These approaches are more representative, meaningful, and precise inferences compared to simpler methods [ Therefore, the general purpose of this investigative study is to assess heat tolerance in a wide number of wheat genotypes based on seedling performance. Precise objectives are outlined to- (i) evaluate the variations in morpho-physiological features of the wheat genotypes subjected to high temperature stress; (ii) categorize wheat genotypes into distinct clusters differing in heat tolerance using hierarchical clustering algorithm; and (iii) identify potential heat-tolerant genotypes and seedling traits associated with heat stress tolerance using diverse multivariate approaches. In this exploratory investigation, eighty wheat genotypes of diverse nature were collected from various sources. Among them, 9 mutant lines (mutagen: 1 % EMS) were collected from ACI Seed; 14 varieties and 2 advanced lines from Bangladesh Wheat and Maize Research Institute; 1 variety from Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture; and rest of the 54 wheat accessions collected from Plant Genetic Resource Center of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute.  Seeds of uniform sized of each wheat genotypes were selected prior to sowing. The selected seeds were first disinfected with 80% ethanol for 5 min, rinsed thoroughly with sterile distilled water, and then soaked in distilled water for another 10 min. Before that, the germination trays (21cm × 15cm × 4.5 cm) were filled up with 1.5 kg of sterile sand moistened with distilled water. Later on, for the specified control and heat stress conditions, 90 seeds from each genotype were placed in two germination trays. The trays were kept under normal room temperature condition (28–33 °C) for five days. Five days after seed sowing, the percent germination in each germination tray was determined as n/N × 100 (where n represents the total number of germinated seed; N represents the total number of seeds sown) ( Each germination tray was provided with 50 mL of half-concentrated Hoagland's solution on every alternated day as a source of nutrients. The control temperature was continued up to 17 days of sowing. On 18th day after seed sowing, one set of germination tray was transferred to another growth facility of same nature and heat stress (35/25  The seedling traits like lengths and dry and fresh weights of shoots and roots were recorded from 10 seedlings in each replicate. The length of shoots and roots was determined by measuring from the root-shoot junction to the respective leaf and root apices. Dry weights of shoots and roots were measured after oven drying (DSO-300D, Digisystem Laboratory Instruments Inc., Taiwan) at 80 °C for 24 h. The root dry weight over the shoot dry weight was used to determine the root-shoot ratio. Tissue water content (TWC), an expression of the amount of water present per unit of shoot and root fresh weight, was determined following the formula proposed by Mickky et al. [ The formula of Hellal et al. [ The relative water content of leaf (LRWC) was determined in accordance of Meher et al. [ Cell membrane stability (CMS) was assessed using the slightly modified protocol described by Rasool et al. [ The germination trays with wheat seedlings were allowed to dark-adapt for 30 min before the measurement of chlorophyll  Heat stress induced thylakoid membrane damage (TMD) was measured by comparing the F The same leaves used for recording chlorophyll  The ratios of chlorophyll  For the measurement of seedling traits, the fully developed leaves from ten seedlings were pooled to create a single biological replicate. This process was repeated twice more using separate sets of seedlings for a total of three replicates. For the recording of fluorescence attributes and pigment contents, six fully expanded lowermost leaves were collected. Two leaves were pooled to create one biological replicate. This pooling was repeated three times to obtain a total of three replicates. For all the measurements and assays, samples were collected separately from control and heat-treated seedlings. The collected data on seedling traits were expressed as relative values (RV). The RV was calculated based to the formula prescribed in Wahab et al. [ Every form of statistical analysis was performed using R-4.0.3 for win ( The graphical representation via boxplots and radar plot were adopted to illustrate the impact of heat stress on wheat seedling and relative magnitude of change in the seedling traits due to a-week long heat stress treatment, respectively. Boxplots visually summarize multiple variable distributions, aiding in detecting relationships, comparing central tendency and variability, and aiding in exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing [ Correlation analysis not only helps identify patterns and dependencies in datasets by quantifying linear relationships between variables but also provides a holistic view of interdependencies and aids in variable selection [ LDA is a powerful multivariate analysis method used to improve classification accuracy by finding linear combinations of features in complex datasets, reducing dimensionality, and discriminating between groups [ While tested in two growing conditions (control and heat stress), 80 wheat genotypes showed highly significant ( The descriptive statistics of the seedling attributes of wheat genotypes under distinct temperature conditions are displayed in the box plots.

In our study, the PCA was computed to enhance the discriminatory power for categorizing the measured traits based on their relationships under heat stress conditions. In the present study, a total of 20 principal components (PCs) were acquired, but only first six PCs with eigenvalues >1 were considered as significant (data not shown). These six PCs explained about 84% of the genotypic variability, as influenced by observed traits. Among the significant PCs, the first two components explained about 49% of the total variability ( PCA-variable plot showing the position of seedling traits. A vector's length and color intensity in the plot specify the representation quality and traits contribution to the principal components, respectively. Positive or negative interactions of the seedling attributes are displayed by the angles between the vectors produced from the plot's central point. Details of seedling traits are presented in  The correlation coefficients were employed to measure the degree of association among the seedling traits. The greater amount of stronger significant correlations among the studied traits were observed under control compared to the heat stress conditions ( The Pearson correlation coefficient values are displayed in the correlation heatmap for the selected seedling traits under control (A) and heat stress (B) conditions. The blue values are positive and the red ones are negative. It has a range of −1 to 1, whereby −1 denotes an absolute negative linear relationship, 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 specifies no relationship at all between studied variables. Details of seedling traits are presented in  The majority of the seedling traits selected by PCA exhibited significant correlations among themselves across growing conditions ( The cluster heatmap consisted of three clusters for the genotypes and three groups based on the variability available in the studied seedling traits ( Heatmap and cluster analysis (method = wardD2 and distance = Euclidean) based on PCA-selected traits influencing genotypic variability in heat tolerance revealed association between genotypes and seedling traits. The relative values (RV) attained from the PCA-selected traits of the wheat genotypes were subjected to cluster analysis. Three clusters were acquired at the genotype level (cluster-1, 2 and 3) and three groups (group-1, 2 and 3) were obtained at the trait level. The intensity of the relative values for the studied attributes is expressed by various color tones. Results indicated that Cluster 1 exhibited the highest potential for heat stress tolerance due to superior performance across most seedling traits, followed by Clusters 2 and 3.  The average RV of all seedling trait was highest in Cluster 1 ( Comparative profiles of the three hierarchically clustered groups of 80 genotypes of wheat (the means of the relative values [RV] for genotypes of individual cluster are represented by the cluster figures). The results obtained from cluster analysis revealed that the genotypes in Cluster 1 performed substantially better under heat stress condition followed by Cluster 2, while the genotypes of Cluster 3 performed poorly under the same temperature regime ( Spider plot demonstrating the changes in studied attributes of the genotypes of various clusters as affected by high temperature stress. The values are given as a percentage of the control. Details of seedling traits are presented in  Mean values of assessed seedling characteristics under both growing conditions and their variation (%) due to heat stress from control of three clusters. According to Tukey's HSD, mean % change values in a column with different superscript letter(s) are statistically different at p ≤ 0.05. The (+) and (−) signs indicate the percent increase and decrease, respectively regarding the effect of heat stress treatment over control. Details of seedling traits are presented in  The genotypes of Cluster 1 were least affected in terms of SDW with a reduction of 17% while greater reduction was noticed in Clusters 2 and 3 with an average decline of 28% ( The degree of variation and heat stress sensitivity was very little in case of F Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a technique used to reclassify genotypes based on previous classification criteria and to minimize the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving maximum information.  On the other hand, 42% of total variation is explained by LD2, and was markedly contributed by F After performing cluster analysis, the wheat genotypes placed in individual clusters were confirmed with the aid of the prognostic capability of LDA. On the basis of LDA, wheat genotypes present in the preceding clusters were examined, matched, and re-allocated misclassified genotypes into the true groups ( Matrix of classification based on LDA for three groups of 80 wheat genotypes (columns representing the anticipated category and rows showing the observed category). The LDA was also adopted to determine the Mahalanobis squared distance ( Pairwise Mahalanobis squared distances (D Distances that are significantly different from zero at a 95 % confidence level. The multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) was calculated using the selected traits from PCA to identify the heat-tolerant genotypes.

The SDW was significantly impacted by other seedling traits under heat stress conditions compared to the control group ( Multiple linear regression to evaluate the effect on seedling traits on shoot dry weight (SDW) under both growing conditions (n = 80). A week-long heat stress significantly affected the morpho-physiological attributes of wheat genotypes, with almost all seedling traits exhibiting decreases compared to the control ( Principal component analysis (PCA) is a valuable statistical technique to lessen the dimensionality and gathering expressive information from a vastly connected complex dataset [ Correlation studies reveal the type and strength of relationships between traits, aiding plant breeders in selecting desirable varieties with preferred characteristics [ In the present study, enhanced accumulation of biomass (dry weights of shoot and root) and tissue water content appear to be crucial factors for genotypes grouped in the superior-performing Cluster 1. This aligns with the established principle that tolerance to stressful environments is often linked to dry matter accumulation in seedlings [ The water-splitting efficiency on the donor side of PSII (F Plant pigment systems, including chlorophyll  Hierarchical cluster analysis is an efficient method used by researchers to categorize genotypes based on their similarity across various stress tolerance indices [ Cluster analysis has several limitations that can hinder the selection of tolerant genotypes. These include subjectivity interpretation, inadequate dimensionality reduction, challenges in handling missing data, lack of statistical rigor, and the inability to account for interaction effects [ A crucial prerequisite for assessing plant's overall performance is increased biomass output, measured by dry matter accumulation, especially under stressful conditions [ In conclusion, our study demonstrated that heat stress significantly impacted seedling performance. Multivariate analysis approaches proved to be powerful tools for this exploratory investigation. PCA effectively unmasked the seedling traits that exerted the greatest influence to the genotypic variability. Most of the PCA-selected traits were significantly correlated with each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis enabled us to categorize the genotypes according to their tolerance to heat stress. The genotypes in Cluster 1 exhibited the highest level of heat stress tolerance relative to clusters 2 and 3. LDA confirmed a high classification accuracy, with 93% of genotypes correctly assigned to their respective hierarchical clusters. MGIDI analysis successfully identifying twelve highly heat-tolerant and stable genotypes: BG-30, BD-468, BG-24, BD-9908, BG-32, BD-476, BD-594, BD-553, BD-488, BG-33, BD-495, and AS-10627, all of them originated from the tolerant Cluster 1. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that root and shoot fresh and dry weights, tissue water content, root-shoot weight ratio, and pigment contents had significant association with seedling biomass.

11470463,Management and prognosis of acute Emamectin Benzoate poisoning in a human,"Emamectin Benzoate (EB) is a semi-synthetic insecticide which was primarily created to combat lepidopteron insects. EB disrupts the neurotransmitters Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) through enhancing permeability of membrane chloride ion, resulting in the loss of cell function progressing to irreversible paralysis in invertebrates. Poisoning with EB in humans is rare; till date with just about five reported cases, two of which resulted in fatalities. Scarcity of treatment management information may cause a delay in the initiation of treatment, which is often general therapy rather than specific. By reporting this rare case of poisoning in human, the researchers wish to add value to the existing information and aid in forming a standard management of EB poisoning in humans. Here within, we report an acute case of EB poisoning in an adult male with no history of co-morbidities, had allegedly consumed approximately 125 mL of EB 1.9 % and, presented with complaints of vomiting, profuse sweating and drowsiness. The patient was treated with gastric lavage, fluid replenishment, and other supportive as well as symptomatic measures. The prognosis of the patient was guarded and care has been taken not to administer any Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants. Fortunately, the patient was discharged from the hospital by day 4 without any sequelae. Till date only six cases (5 cases, 1 case series) have been reported among which two cases reported fatalities. Emamectin Benzoate poisoning is rare, and the prognosis is usually guarded. However, presence of any CNS depressants i.e., alcohol, diazepams etc. could worsen the prognosis. Emamectin Benzoate is poorly absorbed when consumed orally and rapidly eliminated with half-lives of roughly 1.5 days. Toxicokinetics in humans has not yet been established.","Emamectin Benzoate (EB) is a semi-synthetic insecticide that belongs to a class of avermectin family and was primarily created to combat lepidopteron insects  EB seems to be a cost-effective pesticide with only 6 g/acre requirement leading to its soaring popularity  GABA receptors with high affinity are thought to be stimulated by EB, which results in increased influx of membrane chloride ions into the neuronal cells, causing damage to cell and nerve impulse. This process causes minimal damage to the crops as the insects cease feeding  Furthermore, till date there were only five peer reviewed case reports on EB poisoning in humans. Unfortunately, due to lack of standard treatment protocol for EB poisoning, all these reports solely relied on symptomatic management. In this report, the authors described the management of EB poisoning in a male adult presented with complaints of vomiting and profuse sweating and drowsiness. The patient showed no signs of altered sensorium during the course of treatment, which in certain poisoning cases indicates poor prognosis. A male patient in his early 20 s, with complaints of three episodes of vomiting, profuse sweating and drowsiness was presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care teaching hospital with alleged consumption of 125 mL of EB 1.9 % mixed with food. The patient was primarily treated with gastric lavage at a rural primary health care center. On examination the patient, was afebrile, drowsy, with tenderness in the epigastric region, oriented to time and place, and without any co-morbidities. The patient weighed around 58 kgs and ingested about 125 mL of the compound EB which is approximately 47.5 mg/kg. Pulse rate was 107 beats per minute (BPM), Blood Pressure (BP) showed 130/96 mmHg, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of Eye response-4 Verbal response-5 Motor response-6 (E Laboratory reports highlight the elevation of Total Bilirubin and Direct Bilirubin, and Complete Blood count showed the impression of neutrophilia; values are depicted below in  Elevated lab parameters with their normal range. Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) had tested positive for mild acidosis; values are depicted in  ABG chart on Day 1–3. On day 1, the patient complained of left-sided throbbing headache and a cardiovascular system (CVS) examination confirmed mild tachycardia (heart rate 107 bpm). Patient was treated symptomatically, was kept nil by mouth (NBM) and later started on plain liquids orally by day 2. Psychiatry opinion was taken and patient had counseling and psycho education in view of depression symptoms. On day 2, the patient was shifted from intensive care unit as his prognosis has improved to fair. Repeated ABG reports suggested no further acidosis. On day 4, patient was symptomatically and hemodynamically stable, and was discharged from hospital. In this patient who ingested approximately 125 mL of a formulated product 1.9 % EB, about 47.5 mg/kg of the active compound EB has been consumed along with solvents. Clinical manifestations were mainly limited to gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and sweating as well as drowsiness. With the exception of slightly elevated direct and total bilirubin, all laboratory tests were within the normal range. Psychiatric education was initiated by a psychiatrist as the patient showed signs of depression and was discharged by the fourth day without any complications. While comparing for safety, the quantity of poison that a patient consumed along with their medication and social history must be taken into consideration in cases of EB poisoning. Most fatal cases were noted in patients with chronic alcohol history. Early treatment with gastric lavage may enhance the efficacy of treatment and improve the prognosis of patients. Throughout the literatures, there have only been six incidents of EB poisoning among which two humans had fatal sequelae  First EB poisoning in human was reported by Yen and Lin, in which a 67 years old male patient consumed approximately 500 mL of diluted insecticide prepared from 100 mL of 2.15 % w/w EB concentrate and 400 mL of tap water. An hour after ingesting the insecticide, he reports experiencing nausea, vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, and mild confusion. Fortunately, the patient’s general condition improved the next day and was discharged a week later without any complications  In the literature by Yadav GK et al., a 6 years old female patient weighing 20 kgs consumed 5 g of 5 % w/w EB which is approximately 250 mg/kg. The patient had mild symptoms of disturbance of consciousness and gastrointestinal distress, was discharged on the third day and a review after a week showed no complications  The Godhiwala P et al., had published a case report of 40 years old male who was chronic alcoholic with no known co-morbidities, allegedly consumed 500 g of EB 5 % Soluble Granules (SG). Inj. Levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily was administered to address myoclonic jerks with generalized seizure along with Inj. Flumazenil 0.25 mg, a benzodiazepine antagonist was also given intravenously over 15–30 seconds. However, on third day, the patient succumbed to death despite aggressive resuscitative efforts with severe metabolic acidosis, shock and ventricular tachycardia  Park JM also had reported an unfortunate case of EB poisoning of a 75 years old male who consumed 100 mL of undiluted 2.5 % EB, having a history of major depressive disorder and was on alprazolam, donepezil, paroxetine, and quetiapine. He presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, hypotension and hypoxemia but no CNS depression. Intensive treatment was provided as patient developed quick onset of metabolic acidosis but following a cardiac arrest, the patient had fatal outcome  A case series published by Khatri A reported a case of multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in a patient. A 52 years old male patient who consumed 50 g of 5 % EB under the influence of alcohol developed severe symptoms from acute respiratory failure to MODS within two days of consumption. He was on mechanical ventilator for eight days, underwent nine hemodialysis treatments and got discharged after one month without any sequelae. Whereas a 22 years old female patient who consumed 200 g of 5 % EB did not have any complications and got discharged after four days in the hospital without any complications  As EB is a relatively large molecule, it is not completely absorbed when taken orally, and poorly absorbed when applied topically, and rapidly eliminated in the feces, with whole-body half-lives of roughly 1.5 days. While EB is not significantly metabolized in mammals, the minimal knowledge on its metabolites suggests that EB is not detoxified by metabolism. In animals LD Research suggests that EB was rapidly removed from the plasma of rats, with half-lives ranging from roughly 15–28 hours following oral or intravenous administration. Residues were broadly distributed throughout the body, with the largest amounts in the lungs. Furthermore, following high dose oral exposures, relatively significant amounts of EB residues were found in the gastrointestinal system, indicating that oral absorption was limited. Based on the time course of residues following intravenous and oral administration, approximately 40–60 % of the orally administered EB was absorbed. Despite the fact that the nervous system is clearly the target of EB toxicity, residues in the brain and spinal cord were extremely low in comparison to most other tissues. EB and one N-demethylated metabolite were nearly entirely eliminated in the feces, with very little parent or metabolite identified in the urine. In a study done on goats, tissue assay showed highest EB concentrations in the liver and kidney and majority was excreted through feces with only few concentrations found in the urine  The tissue distribution of EB after a single oral dose in Atlantic salmon was also investigated by means of whole-body autoradiography and scintillation counting (distribution study). EB concentration gradually dropped from the completion of treatment (day 7) to day 70, with half-lives in muscle, plasma, and mucus of 9.2, 10.0, and 11.3 days, respectively  The literature states EB is a macro cyclic lactone and a broad-spectrum insecticide used in vegetables with rapid paralytic action in insects leading to their death. However, wide safety margin has been established in mammals which may be attributed to the presence of GABA mediated nerves only in the CNS whereas in invertebrates, such nerves are present along the peripheral muscles  GABA neurotransmitters i.e., by stimulating the release of γ-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter causes irreversible paralysis, which leads to cessation of feeding and killing of the organism in 2–4 days  The mechanism of action of EB involves disruption of the neurotransmitter GABA causing irreversible paralysis in invertebrates. Furthermore, GABA receptors with high affinity are thought to be stimulated by EB, which also enhances membrane chloride ion permeability to the opening of the ion channel into the neuronal cells resulting in the disruption of nerve impulses and loss of cell function. EB additionally enhances activity of GABA in the CNS, which may result in CNS depression  In cases of EB poisoning, first resuscitation was initiated, coupled with supportive and symptomatic therapy. Uses of any CNS depressants were avoided as EB is believed to enhance GABA receptors. Levetiracetam was given as a treatment in case a patient develops seizures. Due to scarcity of management of EB poisoning, in all reported cases, only supportive and symptomatic managements were given. In a situation of EB poisoning, early initiation of gastric lavage may improve patients' overall prognosis as it aids in removing the toxins from the body. In general, lack of specific antidote is usually a predictor for untoward prognosis. However, concurrent use or presence of CNS depressants in the patients i.e., benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol could prove otherwise. In case a patient develops seizures, levetiracetam may be utilized for treatment. Side-effects of EB poisoning can range from simple gastrointestinal distress to severe CNS manifestations, and cardiac distress which might result in death. Fatal cases and unfortunate prognosis were reported more with EB poisoning when consumed along with alcohol. Emergency physicians should be made aware of the likelihood of rapid worsening in patients due to an underlying ailment or related substance abuse that might further oppress CNS. Through this paper, the researchers aim to contribute to the existing knowledge on EB poisoning, highlighting the necessity for further in-depth studies. More research is needed to determine the exact pathophysiology and effects of EB on humans, which would aid in the development of a standard treatment strategy to reduce mortality.

11470425,Genetic and in-silico approaches for investigating the mechanisms of ciprofloxacin resistance in ,,"Typhoid fever affects approximately 21 million individuals each year, leading to 128,000 to 161,000 deaths around the world. It is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 10 %–30 % if not treated [ AMR has become a significant global health concern, particularly with the growing resistance in  The present study aims to elucidate the molecular complexity of fluoroquinolone resistance, which is a first-line treatment for typhoid infection. Fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin, are widely used antibiotics for treating typhoid. However, frequent use of fluoroquinolones leads to resistance, triggered by various genetic factors. These factors include mutations in the target genes responsible for DNA replication and repair, namely gyrase ( This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Biosciences, Mohammad Ali Jinnah University.

These alterations may reduce the ability of ciprofloxacin to effectively interact with its target enzymes, leading to diminished drug efficacy. However, to conclusively demonstrate this mechanism, further studies involving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or experimental structural biology approaches, such as X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy, are necessary. These methods could provide a more detailed understanding of the conformational changes induced by the mutations and their impact on drug binding.

11470401,A comprehensive dental dataset of six classes for deep learning based object detection study,"This article presents a dental dataset for the improvement of research on deep learning-based detection and classification of dental diseases. The dataset is consisted of 232 panoramic dental radiographs, categorized into six major classes: healthy teeth, caries, impacted teeth, infections, fractured teeth, and broken-down crowns/roots (BDC/BDR). The images were collected from three renowned private clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the help of an experienced dental practitioner who ensured the confidentiality of patients and high-quality data acquisition using a 64-megapixel Android phone camera. To enhance the value of the dataset for machine and deep learning applications, we applied Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image enhancement and augmented the data. The images were annotated using the CVAT tool and reviewed by dental experts. This benchmark dataset is publicly available and provides a valuable resource for researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, and dental informatics to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of advanced algorithms for dental disease detection.","Specifications Table 
 The Dental OPG X-RAY [ This dataset included a diverse collection of 232 dental radiographs labelled with six different classes. This variety allows researchers to explore the application of machine learning and deep learning models for multi-class classification in dental health. The diversity of the dataset in patient age and dental conditions enhances its generalizability across different demographic groups, making it a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven dental diagnostics. This dataset provides both original and augmented data and offers a robust foundation for training, testing, and improving machine-learning algorithms. This enables researchers to experiment with different models and techniques, contributing to the advancement of AI in dental healthcare and potential automation of dental diagnostic processes. The dataset excluded individuals under 10 years of age to focus on adult dental structures, which vary significantly from those of children. This targeted selection enhances the utility of the dataset in studying age-related variations in dental diseases and the effectiveness of AI models across different age groups. This dataset fosters collaboration between computer science and dental health experts, promoting interdisciplinary research that bridges the gap between technology and health care. This dataset serves as a valuable resource not only for AI and computer science researchers but also for dental professionals, educators, and students. It can be used in educational settings to train dental practitioners in the identification of various dental diseases. We developed a benchmark dental disease dataset aimed at advancing research and innovation in dental health, particularly focusing on the detection and classification of multi-class dental diseases [ The dataset included six dental conditions. Each condition presents unique symptoms. If it left untreated, can lead to further complications. Accurate diagnosis and early treatment are crucial for the effective management of these dental issues. Healthy teeth are the ideal state of dental health, in which the teeth and surrounding structures are free from damage or disease. Healthy teeth have intact enamel, no signs of decay or infection, and proper alignment and spacing [ Tooth decay or cavities are known as caries and are one of the most common dental problems. Caries occur when acids produced by bacteria in the mouth erode the tooth enamel, leading to the formation of cavities [ Impacted teeth are those that are blocked from erupting properly into the mouth. This problem frequently occurs in wisdom teeth, which frequently lack sufficient space to grow or are displaced. Impacted teeth can result in discomfort, pain, and swelling and have the potential to create additional dental complications, such as infection or damage to nearby teeth. Radiographs of impacted teeth typically reveal the tooth being entrapped under the gum or being situated in an abnormal position within the jawbone. Early detection is important to avoid complications and determine the necessity of surgical treatment. Dental infections, such as abscesses, are dangerous conditions in which bacteria infiltrate the inner layers of the tooth or the surrounding tissues, resulting in inflammation and pus accumulation. These infections can lead to intense pain, swelling, and fever and may spread to other parts of the body if not treated early. Dental infections often appear as dark spots surrounding tooth roots on radiographs, indicating either bone deterioration or infection [ Fractured teeth refer to any break or crack in a tooth that can occur due to trauma, biting on hard objects, or weakened tooth structure. Fractures can vary in severity from minor cracks in the enamel to deep cracks that extend into the tooth pulp or root. These fractures can cause pain, sensitivity, and increase the risk of infection. Radiographs of fractured teeth help identify the extent of the damage and guide the choice of treatment, which may include bonding, crowns, or extraction. Broken-down crowns or roots refer to teeth that have undergone significant structural damage, often to the point where they cannot be restored using simple dental procedures. This syndrome can arise from significant dental deterioration, numerous dental procedures, or serious physical injuries. Teeth that have broken down crowns or roots may be in a severely damaged state, with significant portions missing or decayed. Radiographs of these teeth commonly show significant dental caries, fractures, or other indications of structural deterioration [ Example of a) Caries, b) Impacted Teeth, c) Healthy Teeth, d) BDC/BDR, e) Infection, f) Fractured Teeth. Folder structure of the dataset. Workflow of this study. Attributes of the dataset. Dental health is a significant global concern, with various issues affecting populations in different regions. First, we tried to learn about various dental diseases, symptoms, the depth of damage to patients, and the widespread use of these dental issues. We found that dental diseases and treatments can be automated and AI can be detected. Therefore, we conducted an experiment with an experienced dental practitioner and collected X-rays from three different clinics under his supervision. We then photographed the X-rays using an Android mobile camera and created a collection. Finally, we decided that these X-rays could be used to classify and identify dental disorders by applying computer vision and deep learning algorithms [ We obtained 232 panoramic dental radiographs from dental clinics for this study. The dataset did not include teeth from individuals aged less than 10 years. The tooth structures in adults and children differ. Therefore, this specific group of teeth has not been considered to maintain consistency across different age ranges. The dataset included six different dental diagnoses: caries, impacted teeth, infections, fractured teeth, broken-down crown/broken-down root (BDC/BDR), and healthy teeth. We stored the images in the JPG format and the labels in the JSON format. The dataset had two folders: object detection data and classification data. The object detection folder contains 232 raw images and labels and 604 augmented images, which are split into three files: train, test, and valid. The training folder has 558 images and labels; the test and valid folders both have 23 images and labels. On the other hand, classification folder contains six distinct classes as folders. The aspect ratio of these images was 16:9, and the median image ratio was 1176 × 603 pixels. The image resolution is 64 megapixels. The total number of instances across all classes was 1204. Each radiograph underwent an annotation process where regions corresponding to the identified diagnoses were labeled following a standard data annotation protocol. Thus, a fully anonymized dental panoramic image dataset was obtained, and no personal information could be used to identify patients. A batch of collected radiographs is shown in  Sample of collected radiographs. The dataset was created using a Samsung A52 phone camera, specifically, the SM-A525F model. This camera captures images with a resolution of 64 megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, allowing for clear and detailed photos. The camera has several helpful features, including an automatic exposure time ranging from 1/6000 s to 10 s. The ISO speed, which controls the camera's sensitivity to light, can be set automatically or manually with options ranging from 50 to 3200. The focal length of the camera was 26 mm, providing a balanced field-of-view for capturing the images. The photos were taken without using a flash, and a center-weighted average metering mode was used to ensure that the exposure was just right, meaning that the camera focused on the central part of the image for light measurement. There was no exposure bias, which ensured that the images were consistent in quality. The pictures were taken under good lighting conditions, and the camera was handheld by a person, ensuring that the images were clear and of high quality. A detailed description of the camera device is provided in  Brief description of the camera device. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is a technique used to enhance image contrast by targeting significant intensities within localized areas around each pixel. In our study, we applied CLAHE to improve the clarity and visibility of our images. In  Result of CLAHE implementation: a) Enhanced image, b) Raw image. The CVAT annotation tool was used to annotate the panoramic photos. According to the bounding box, a line is stored in the text file. Consequently, there is one line for each annotation or bounding box. As this is a multiclass object detection study, we have six classes, ranging from 0 to 5. A label map file was used to convert this numeric value to an appropriate class level. To annotate images in the CVAT, we first created a new task and uploaded our images. Then, the annotation type (e.g., bounding box, square) was selected, and annotations were drawn on the images by clicking, dragging, or adding vertices. Subsequently, labels were assigned to the annotated objects, adjusted as needed, and navigated through the images to complete the annotations. CVAT automatically saves work and can be manually saved. Once done, we exported the annotations in desired format (e.g., YOLO) via the “Actions” dropdown, and downloaded the labels for use in the project. The annotation process was initially completed by a dentist with 16 years of experience using the annotation program CVAT, and it was later examined (addition, deletion, and confirmation) by a dentist with 32 years of experience. An example of placing a bounding box around problematic teeth is shown in  Annotating using CVAT annotation tool. The dataset was processed using Roboflow and augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the training set. The preprocessing steps included auto orientation and resizing to fit within 640 × 640 pixels. The augmentation process generated three outputs per training example by applying horizontal flips, rotations between −15° and +15°, shear transformations of ±10° both horizontally and vertically, and exposure adjustments within a range of −10 % to +10 %. In addition, mosaic augmentation [ Summary of works related to dental diseases detection using deep learning. To introduce our new “Dental OPG X-ray dataset,” [ Dataset evaluation on Object detection algorithm. Training graph of mAP50. First of all the dataset size was relatively small. Only 232 original images, which might limit the generalization of deep learning models to larger for more diverse populations. Second, the images were collected from only three clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh; therefore, the dataset may not fully represent dental conditions from different regions or demographics. Additionally, the dataset excluded individuals under 10 years of age, which means that it cannot be used to study dental diseases in children. Finally, the images were captured using a single type of camera, which may introduce bias in the image quality and consistency. All data collection procedures for this study were conducted in accordance with international ethical guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans (CIOMS-WHO). Informed consent was obtained from the participating clinics and no personally identifiable information was included in the dataset. The study protocol, along with the informed consent forms, received approval from the Bangladesh Dental College & Hospital's local Ethics Committee (Protocol No: MK-198109).","['Dental disease', 'Dental informatics', 'Radiograph', 'Detection']",2024-9-21,Data in Brief,AIDS

Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring phytochemicals in  A total of 27 phytochemicals were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against AChE, BACE1, and TACE with YASARA Structure. ADMET profiles and toxicity were assessed. The top candidate compounds underwent 100 ns MD simulations. All ligands met Lipinski's rule and showed low toxicity. Catechins, compared with the known drug galantamine, showed higher inhibitory activity and interacted with additional active sites on AChE, thus suggesting potentially higher efficacy. Moreover, chlorogenic acid showed stronger inhibitory activity against TACE than the control drug (aryl-sulfonamide), thereby suggesting a different mechanism of action. MD simulation revealed that the formed complexes had good stability. However, further exploration is necessary.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease posing substantial global health challenges involving cognitive decline and memory impairment.

This method indicated that all ligands from  Molecular docking analyses were conducted in YASARA Structure (Bioinformatics 30, 2981-2982 version 19.9.17). The YASARA Structure docking procedure was initiated through the script “dock_runscreening.mcr,” by using the VINA docking engine. Each docking simulation was repeated 100 times with the AMBER 14 forcefield, and the simulation cell was filled with water set to a density of 0.997 g/L. Subsequently, Gasteiger charges were assigned to model the electrostatic interactions of the molecules. AChE (PDB ID:  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to investigate the protein–ligand complexes' dynamic behavior and stability for the top-scoring ligands identified for each of the three target enzymes (AChE, BACE1, and TACE). This powerful drug discovery method considers the inherent flexibility of proteins, thus providing a more realistic representation of binding than static docking methods. YASARA Structure (Bioinformatics 30, 2981-2982 version 19.9.17) was used for simulation with the AMBER14 force field. The simulation was conducted under physiological conditions with a constant temperature of 310 K, pH 7.4, and 0.9% NaCl solution. Gasteiger charges were then assigned to model the electrostatic interactions of the molecules. In addition, the simulation cell was solvated with water set to a 0.997 g/L density and extended by 20 Å in each direction to account for solvation effects ( Visualization of the state of the molecular dynamics simulation of A) Catechin-AChE.

MD simulation was performed to compute the stability of ligand–enzyme complexes. Several parameters were used, including RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and binding free energy calculation with MM-PBSA. The dynamic behavior and stability of six complexes were determined according to RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and MM-PBSA. In addition, MD simulation was performed in YASARA Structure software with a 100 ns trajectory, and the all-atom force fields AMBER14 and SASA for the complexes. SASA analysis indicated the stability of the control drugs and the chlorogenic acid-BACE1 complex in 100 ns MD simulations. The complexes showed minimal fluctuations in SASA values, thus suggesting minimal changes in the solvent exposure of the protein surface after ligand binding ( SASA as a function of simulation time, depicted for the ligand–enzyme complexes after 100 ns MD simulations. The plot includes complexes of catechin-AChE (black), galantamine-AChE (red), chlorogenic acid-TACE (purple), aryl-sulfonamide-TACE (green), chlorogenic acid-BACE1 (yellow), and 2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one-BACE1 (blue).

The complexes include galantamine-AChE (red), chlorogenic acid-TACE (purple), aryl-sulfonamide-TACE (green), chlorogenic acid-BACE1 (yellow), and 2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one-BACE1 (blue). RMSF profiles showed similar stability in the 100 ns MD simulations for all complexes, in line with the results from RMSF analysis ( RMSF plot of catechin-AChE (black), galantamine-AChE (red), chlorogenic acid-TACE (purple), aryl-sulfonamide-TACE (green), chlorogenic acid-BACE1 (yellow), and 2-imino-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidin-4-one-BACE1 (blue). AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregation of amyloid plaques and protein tangles in the brain. In this context, BACE1 inhibition may provide a strategy to decrease the production of amyloid-β peptides, a major component of the amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brains of affected individuals. Docking simulation revealed that chlorogenic acid formed favorable interactions in the BACE1 binding pocket. Therefore, by inhibiting BACE1 activity, these compounds might potentially slow the formation and progression of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. The identified phytochemicals were evaluated according to Lipinski's rule of five to assess drug-likeness properties. This widely used rule predicts compounds' absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles according to their physicochemical properties. Specifically, Lipinski's rule suggests that compounds with a molecular weight less than 500 Da, a logP value below 5, no more than ten hydrogen bond acceptors, no more than five hydrogen bond donors, and fewer than ten rotatable bonds show favorable drug-like characteristics. These parameters influence compounds' ability to be absorbed, to be distributed in the body, to be metabolized and excreted, and to potentially cause toxicity (collectively known as the ADMET profile). According to Lipinski's rule, favorable properties suggest a high likelihood of a compound's successful navigation of these processes in the body. The phytochemicals inconsistent with the rule violated only logP >3, thus potentially indicating poor solubility and bioavailability, and negatively affecting their efficacy and safety as drugs. After  The docking results for AChE and BACE1 showed favorable binding affinities for catechin and chlorogenic acid. However, the binding affinity values were not significantly lower than those of the established drugs galantamine-AChE and aryl-sulfonamide-BACE1 ( Our results indicated the potential of  The number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions significantly affects the strength and stability of ligand-receptor binding. Non-covalent and hydrophobic interactions significantly influence the strength and stability of ligand-receptor binding. In addition, 2D visualization identifies two types of hydrogen bonds, conventional and carbon-hydrogen bonds, whereas hydrophobic interactions include pi and alkyl. MD simulation of the binding pockets of AChE, BACE1, and TACE was conducted to provide insights for drug discovery. In addition, AMBER14 was used as the computational tool for simulation. The force field included a comprehensive set of parameters delineating atom interactions in a molecule, comprising bond stretching, angle bending, and non-bonded interactions. AMBER14 offers a suite of functionalities, such as input file preparation, simulation execution, analysis of results, and visualization of molecular structures and interactions. This software facilitates the exploration of biomolecule dynamics and properties under diverse conditions and environments in biochemistry and drug discovery. The SASA graph indicated the compactness of the target protein after interaction with an inhibitor, primarily through hydrophobic interactions. During the 100 ns and 5 ns simulations, all complexes showed stable RMSD movement ( Rg is a fundamental metric for characterizing the sizes of chain molecules and a key indicator of protein compactness and flexibility in biological contexts. In this study, this variable enabled the comparison of the protein structures relative to the hydrodynamic radius, an experimentally observable parameter. According to Ghahremanian et al., insights derived from measurements can substantially contribute to understanding of the dynamic interplay between proteins and their surrounding environment. YASARA's built-in macros were used to conduct calculations, where positive energy indicated stronger binding. In addition, stronger binding and compact interactions were indicated by higher binding energy values in MM-PBSA calculations. MD simulation provides insights into the stability of ligand–protein complexes and consequently the pharmacodynamics of the compounds. A highly stable complex, indicated by low RMSD fluctuations and minimal structural changes (Rg), suggests tight binding to the enzyme's active site. Although potent enzyme inhibition might result, other effects might include prolonged drug action or difficulty in drug clearance by the body, thus potentially causing adverse effects. In contrast, high RMSD fluctuations or Rg values in the simulation might signify readily dissociated ligands, thus potentially translating to a short duration of action for the drug and a need for frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects. Chlorogenic acid is a widespread phenolic compound in plants including coffee, fruits, vegetables, and traditional Chinese herbal medicines. This study explored the potential of chlorogenic acid to serve as an anti-AD agent, according to its ability to interact with three key enzymes associated with AD: AChE, BACE1, and TACE. Beyond its potential role in AD treatment, chlorogenic acid exhibits a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antioxidant, hepatoprotective (liver protection), nephroprotective (kidney protection), antibacterial, antitumor, metabolic regulatory (sugar and lipid metabolism), anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. This study described a screening method to explore potential treatments for patients with AD. According to Poon et al. This  This study has several limitations.

11470278,"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Patient Referral among Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors in Obio-Akpor, Rivers State","With the limited number of trained health care providers in Nigeria, PPMVs are inevitable, especially in rural areas for the supply of drugs, and integration through appropriate referral practices is quintessential. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral among PPMVs in a setting with limited hospital infrastructure. This cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted in Obio-Akpor, Rivers State using a structured questionnaire that measured the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted with SPSS version 25 and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Most of the respondents reported moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice (62.4%, 73.4%, and 58% respectively) of patient referral. Multivariate analysis showed statistically significant inverse relationships between years of experience and odds of their knowledge, attitude, and practice of referral. PPMVs with 3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate knowledge (AOR = 178.96; 95%CI: 60.15 - 532.49; p-value <0.005), attitude (AOR = 7.38;95%CI: (3.78 - 14.40; P-value <0.005) and practice (AOR = 131.56; 95%CI: 53.50 - 323.51; p-value <0.005) than those with above 10 years of experience after controlling for the effects of other variables. The most frequently reported barrier to referral was fear of losing clients while most referrals were for laboratory investigations. Most PPMVs reported moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral. PPMVs were aware of the benefits of referrals but concerned about losing their clients to formal healthcare facilities.","Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is at the core of current global healthcare delivery debates and agendas Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) play vital roles in the provision of health services especially for underserved populations in low- and middle-income countries6 but there are indications of poor linkage with formal health services. PPMVs are operators of drug retail outlets selling over the counter (OTC) medicines as well as prescription drugs but do not have formal training as pharmacists Based on their accessibility, affordability, and convenience, PPMVs play a critical role in providing access to care for common health issues. Thus, serving as critical allies in extending healthcare access to hard-to-reach and underserved population groups, especially in countries in transition A referral is a process in which a health care provider at a lower level of the health service seeks assistance or requests a takeover of the management of a medical case by a more equipped and/or specially trained person with better resources operating at a higher level As a result of their dominance across the community, well-trained and regulated PPMVs could support Nigeria’s accelerated journey toward attaining UHC. The task-shifting policies Nigeria implemented in 2014/2015 place higher demands on PPMVs to serve as community-oriented resource persons (CORPs), assisting in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and maternity and child health PPMV’s operations within the community require regulation and supportive supervision to ensure the delivery of equitable quality and safe care in their rapidly expanding roles under a task-shifting regime. Adequate linkage to the formal healthcare providers through the process of referral is a sine qua non in ensuring that patients receive comprehensive, safe, and prompt care. Limited studies on patient referral practices among PPMVs are in relation to specific populations/disease conditions (children under 5 years, malaria testing and treatment, oral contraceptive pill use) This descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in Obio-Akpor LGA of Rivers State was used to measure the participants’ knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral, as well as possible associations of their characteristics with the patient referral. This study was conducted in the Obio/Akpor Local Government Area (LGA) of Rivers State. Obio-Akpor LGA covers 260 km17with a 2006 Census population of 464,789  The Obio-Akpor branch of the National Association of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (NAPPMED) is divided into two administrative units that independently report to the National Association. All PPMVs registered with the Rivers State branch of NAPPMED in Obio/Akpor LGA (Units 1 and 2) made up the research population. Although found in all areas of the LGA, the PPMVs are more concentrated in and around interior settlements and close to the marketplaces. All PPMVs registered with their association (NAPPMED) in both units of Obio-Akpor LGA were included in the study if they consented. The sample size was determined using Cochran’s formula for descriptive cross-sectional surveys we used the formula for descriptive studies (19) Sample size (n) =  Z_(1 —  A stratified random sampling technique was deployed to ensure that each administrative unit in the LGA was adequately represented. The LGA has two administrative units, and simple random sampling was used to select an equal number of PPMVs from each stratum of the LGA. The list of registered PPMVs in the administrative areas under the LGA was used as the sampling frame. The total sample size of 346 questionnaires was divided equally into the two administrative areas with each allocated a sample of 173. Data was collected using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the researchers following a review of the literature. It had two sections; Section A captured the independent variables while Section B had the dependent variables. The independent variables included demographic data (age, sex, marital status, degree of education, occupation), prior patient referral training, and exposure to health education, whereas the dependent variables were knowledge, attitude, practice levels, facilitators, and barriers to patient referral. All the questions were close-ended, and respondents were expected to select just one answer per question. By first employing a pre-tested questionnaire, measurement bias was reduced. Scale internal consistency reliability was measured by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and estimates >0.7 were considered acceptable. The Cronbach’s alpha for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 0.8, 0.85, and 0.87 respectively. To enhance comprehensibility and minimize errors in data collection, the questionnaire was created to be straightforward, concise, and properly formatted. An interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Patent medicine vendor demographics, knowledge of patient referral, attitude, self-reported patient referral behaviors, facilitators, and barriers to referral were collected. The questionnaires were reviewed for random and systematic errors and corrections made. Questionnaires were manually sorted out, data cleaned and then coded before entry into the computer. IBM SPSS software, version 25 for Windows, was used to analyze the data. Each question was scored on a 5-point response scale which was transformed into percentages, items measuring each of the main constructs that represent the dependent variables were summated and thresholds were determined for adequate score (>75%), moderate (50-75%) and poor score (< 50%). Results from descriptive analysis were presented in frequency tables while inferential analysis and bivariate and multivariate ordinal logistics regressions were conducted to examine factors associated with the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of referrals among PPMVs. Ordinal logistics functions of the generalized linear model with a multinomial probability distribution and cumulative logic-linked functions were carried out. This was done using SPSS because the dependent variable was ordinal, and the independent variables were categorical. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the University of Port Harcourt (Ref: UPH/R&D/REC/EXEC/049 dated 12 This section presents the results of knowledge, attitude, and patient referral practices of patent and proprietary medicine vendors in Obio-Akpor LGA of Rivers State. Socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents Knowledge of client referral of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State is presented above, it indicates that 18.3% had adequate knowledge, 62.4% had moderate knowledge and 19.2% had poor knowledge. The attitude of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State towards client referral presented above, shows that 13% had an adequate attitude, 73.4% had a moderate attitude and 13.6% had a poor attitude. While the practice of client referral by the patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor, Rivers State is shown in the pie chart in  Knowledge, attitude, and practice score of the respondents Relationship between PPMV background characteristics and level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral From the data presented in the table, the odds of having adequate knowledge were slightly lower among males compared to females in both the bivariate (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.64 - 1.50) and multivariate models (OR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.59 - 1.52). These findings were, however, not statistically significant. There were statistically significant inverse relationships between years of experience and odds of having adequate knowledge as PPMV with 3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate knowledge (AOR = 178.96; 95%CI: 60.15 - 532.49; p-value <0.005) than those with more than 10 years of experience after controlling for the effects of other variables. Similarly, those with 4 - 10 years of experience reported significantly greater odds (AOR = 20.50; 95%CI: 7.75 - 54.25; p<0.001) compared to those with more than 10 years of experience For attitude, bivariate analysis showed that individuals aged 20-29 have an odds ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.06-0.28) compared to individuals aged 50 and above, indicating a significantly decreased likelihood of adequate patient referral attitude. Similarly, in the multivariate analysis, individuals aged 20-29 still have a significantly decreased likelihood of patient referral after adjusting for other variables, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.44-0.22), and a p-value of <0.005. For the bivariate analysis of attitude scores, the odds ratio (OR) for being male versus female is 1.08, but it is not statistically significant (p = 0.713). After adjusting for other variables in the multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) remains non-significant at 1.23 (p = 0.434). This suggests that gender does not significantly influence practice once other factors are considered. There is however a significant association between age categories and adequate referral practice. Individuals aged 30-39 and 40-49 have decreased odds ratio; 0.34 (0.16 - 0.73) and 0.27 (0.13 - 0.60) respectively of adequate referral practice compared to those aged 50 and above. However, in the multivariate analysis, these associations lose significance (AOR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.45 - 1.68; p-value >0.005 and AOR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.26 - 1.06; p-value >0.005) after adjusting for other variables. This indicates that age may not independently predict the outcome once other factors are considered. Both in the bivariate and multivariate analyses, individuals with more years of experience in the trade have significantly higher odds of adequate referral practice compared to those with fewer years of experience. PPMVs with <3 years of experience reported significantly higher odds of adequate referral practice (AOR = 131.56; 95%CI: 53.50 - 323.51; p-value <0.005) than those with more than 10 years of experience after adjusting for other variables. Similarly, those with 4 - 10 years of experience reported significantly greater odds (AOR = 8.89; 95%CI: 4.07 - 19.41; p<0.001) compared to those with more than 10 years of experience in the trade. Barriers and facilitators to patient referral among PPMVs in Obio/Akpor, Rivers state (n=338). Common facilities patients were referred The study which assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and patient referral practices of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) in Obio/Akpor, Rivers State, found that a high proportion of respondents had moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice (62.4%, 73.4% and 58% respectively) of patient referral and it was significantly associated with their age and experience in the trade. It also highlighted some factors that functioned as facilitators and barriers to patient referrals among these PPMVs. The findings shed light on distinct PPMV responsibilities in healthcare as well as the variables affecting their referral habits. The facilitators identified in this study include the severity of the client's condition, the need for diagnostic tests, and the accessibility of alternative treatments. Barriers to referrals included insufficient training, limited access to healthcare facilities, poor communication, clients' financial constraints, and the fear of losing customers. Addressing these barriers and promoting education and training can enhance the effectiveness of patient referrals and contribute to improved healthcare outcomes. The findings of the study show that for knowledge, most of the respondents had adequate and poor knowledge of referral practice, while the majority had moderate knowledge of client referral. This shows that PPMVs in Obio/Akpor LGA of Rivers State know proper client referrals when faced with health conditions beyond their expertise. This level of habit and knowledge application is in line with the assertion of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health The Level of Knowledge of respondents in this research can be said to be a major influence on the knowledge of referral of patients as is presented in the socio-demographic table where (20.4%) of the respondents had tertiary, or another form of education. While most of the respondents have long years of experience, 28.7% had 4-10 years of experience and 41.1% had more than 10 years of experience with patent and proprietary medicine. This is in line with the results of a study conducted in Rivers State in 2012 In assessing the respondents’ attitudes, the study revealed that most PPMVs had a moderate attitude towards client referral. However, 13% of the PPMVs displayed an adequate attitude while 13.6% demonstrated a poor attitude. Nevertheless, this is still considered a positive attitude overall. The variance in referral attitude amongst participants in this research could be attributed to the level of education and level of training provided for the patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PPMVs). This can be seen in the interventional research findings conducted in 2023 Some factors influence patient referral by the PPMVs, these include the severity of the client’s condition at the time of presentation; although low in percentage, it is in line with the assertion of a previous study The findings of this research show that some of the difficulties experienced by the PPMVs towards patient referrals were a result of inadequate training, which is consistent with the findings of a 2013 research conducted in South Eastern Nigeria Client's inability to pay the cost of care at health facilities also posed a barrier to patient referral, more than one-third of low-income individuals are underinsured (defined as spending more than 5% of family income on medical care), and 8% and 13% avoid or delay seeking medical treatment or prescription drugs, respectively in a previous study The exclusion of unlicensed PPMVs from the study was one of its limitations which could affect the generalization of these findings to all PPMVs in the locality as unregistered and unauthorized PPMVs might operate differently from licensed ones. A further constraint was the deployment of self-report measures, which have been shown to generate information bias. As with other cross-sectional studies, the goal of this study was to provide insights into issues that would help guide future research and interventions. However, because establishing temporality in this kind of study design presents challenges, the connections found in this study cannot be made to be causal. A better understanding of the knowledge, attitude, and patient referral practices of PPMVs can result in better health outcomes for patients through increased health education, better preventive care, lower healthcare costs, and more equitable access to health care. Improving patient outcomes in the community can be facilitated by fixing the identified flaws in the referral process involving the PPMVs. This study identifies the need for collaboration and integration - encouraging collaboration between PPMVs and the formal healthcare system to improve referral pathways and access to equitable and comprehensive healthcare services. Healthcare services may become more efficient and well-coordinated if these cooperative efforts are strengthened. The findings of this research can help build healthcare quality assurance protocols for patent medicine vendors. This could entail creating policies, curriculums, or certification procedures to make sure suppliers follow recommended procedures for patient referrals. Enhancing PPMVs' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) in patient referral necessitates training and certification programs. Comprehensive training is essential because it improves clinical skills and keeps PPMVs up to date with medical guidelines. On the other hand, case studies and hands-on workshops would emphasize the value of making timely referrals. By offering a certification process, one could promote positive patient relations and confidence by establishing professional standards and ethical care. All of this would contribute to the development of standardized referral procedures and efficient provider-to-provider communication, guaranteeing reliable and smooth patient treatment. Potential risks in the healthcare system can be identified by understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and referral practices of patent medicine vendors. Reducing these risks can help build a stronger and more dependable healthcare delivery system. PPMVs had moderate knowledge, attitude, and practice of patient referral even with high awareness of how referrals affected their clients' overall treatment outcomes. Constraints to referral practices at PPMVs include poor follow-up, the cost of accessing care at formal healthcare facilities, and the fear of losing customers. These require urgent interventions involving behavior change communication (BCC) and educational interventions for PPMVs. Regulatory agencies need to step-up monitoring, supervision, and capacity-building operations for PPMVs.","['Attitude', 'Barriers', 'Facilitators', 'Knowledge', 'Patent Medicine Vendor', 'Practice, Referral']",,Nigerian Medical Journal : Journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,AIDS
11470272,Predictors of HIV Testing Among Pregnant Women aged 15-49 Years in Nigeria,"The utilization of HIV testing services in Nigeria has not been optimal due to socioeconomic and demographic factors such as educational level, place of residence, and religion. For Nigeria to achieve epidemic control, pregnant women need to know their HIV status through HIV testing, which is the gateway to HIV prevention, care, support, and treatment services. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of HIV testing among Nigerian pregnant women aged 15-49 years HIV testing during antenatal visits or childbirth. Secondary data analyses of 659 pregnant women randomly selected from the multiple imputation datasets of the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)were done using SPSS version 25. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, HIV stigmatizing attitudes, and HIV testing were retrieved from the dataset for the study. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were done to determine the predictors of HIV testing. The prevalence of self-reported HIV testing and receiving results among women of reproductive age was 36.72%. Bivariate model findings showed that educational level, place of residence, and religion were statistically significant predictors of HIV testing among pregnant women. Only educational level and place of residence significantly predicted pregnant women's HIV testing in the parsimonious multivariable regression model. Pregnant women with higher levels of education (Primary Education, AOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.07,3.19; Secondary Education, AOR, 3.75; 95% CI:1.93, 7.28; Higher Education, AOR, 11.23; 95% CI: 4.40, 28.68) and those living in urban areas (AOR, 1.60: 95% CI:1.03, 2.47) were more likely to test for HIV than those with no education and those living in the rural areas. This study identified having a higher level of education and living in urban areas as predictors of HIV testing, therefore, more efforts are needed to have women with lower levels of education and those living in rural areas test for HIV as a strategy for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.","According to The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), globally,37.7 million people were HIV-positive at the end of 2020. Nigeria is ranked fourth globally regarding the burden of HIV, with an estimated 1.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS in 2020. HIV testing is a leading strategy and the route to prevention, treatment, care, and support services for HIV/AIDS. HIV testing services serve as the gateway to prevention, care, support, and treatment services. We requested permission to use the dataset, which was granted for me to download the data for the study from  This study was a secondary analysis of the 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data of pregnant women aged 15-49 years. The 2013 NDHS was a cross-sectional nationally representative study that used a three-stage stratified cluster design to select the study participants in Nigeria and collect data on the variables of interest using pretested questionnaires. Stigmatizing attitudes of the pregnant women were coded by combining the following seven questions: (1) ""Would you buy fresh vegetables from a vendor who has the AIDS virus?"" (2) ""If a member of your family got infected with the virus that causes AIDS, would you want it to remain a secret or not?"" (3) ""If a relative of yours became sick with the virus that causes AIDS, would you be willing to care for her or him in your own household?"" (4) ""If a female teacher has the AIDS virus, should she be allowed to continue teaching in school?"" And (5) ""Should children aged 12-14 be taught about using a condom to avoid AIDS?"" (6) ""People with the AIDS virus should be ashamed of themselves"" (7) People with the AIDS virus should be blamed for bringing the disease into the community. Stigmatizing attitudes were graded as positive or negative. For the stigmatizing attitudes questions, a score of one (1) was assigned to a positive answer (non-stigmatizing response) and zero (0) for a negative answer (stigmatizing response). A positive answer can be Yes or No to the questions depending on whether the answer is stigmatizing or not and was scored as 1 while a negative answer can also be Yes or No and was scored 0. The scores were summed up to obtain an overall score for each respondent. Respondents scoring less than the mean score for attitudes were classified as having negative attitudes = 0, while those scoring equal or above the mean score were classified as having positive attitudes = 1. The participant’s mean score of .56 (56%) ± was taken as the cut-point. Age categories were categorized into age bands of five-year intervals from 15 to 49 years and numbered in ascending order. Education; No education = 0, primary = 1, secondary = 2, higher = 3. Education was recorded as No education = 0, primary = 1, secondary = 2, higher. Place of Residence was coded as Urban = 1and Rural = 2. Religion was coded as Catholic = 1, Other Christians = 2, Islam = 3, Traditionalist = 4, Others 97. Marital status categories were recoded as Currently Married (combining married and living with a partner as if married options) = 1, Not currently Married (combining other options) = 0. A combination of four questions was used to create the dependent variable from the responses of the pregnant women who participated in the 2013 NDHS as follows: 1. Did you test for HIV as part of antenatal visits? 2. Did you test for HIV between the time you went for delivery and before the baby was born? 3. Did you get the results of the HIV test as part of antenatal visits? 4. Did you get the results of your HIV test before the baby was born? The binary dependent variable ""Self-reported HIV testing by pregnant women aged 15-49 years was coded as; No=0 if the respondent did not test, tested but did not receive the result, and Yes= if the respondent tested and received a result during antenatal visits or childbirth. The pregnant women sample was created from the sample of women of reproductive age by combining three questions: Total child ever born + currently pregnant +ever had a terminated pregnancy. Ever giving birth and a yes answer to currently pregnant and ever had a terminated pregnancy was coded as pregnant woman = 1, while ever not giving birth and not currently pregnant or never had a terminated pregnancy was coded as Not pregnant = 0. Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 was used for the study analysis. The coding’s of the study's variables are shown in  Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Respondents Out of the 659 pregnant women who self-reported either did not test, tested, and did not receive results or tested and received HIV results during antenatal or childbirth, 417 (63.28%) of them did not test or tested and did not receive results, while 242 (36.72%) of them tested and received HIV test. The participants' demographic characteristics are presented below in Table 1. The ages of the pregnant women ranged from 15-49 years and were categorized into seven 5-year groups. Women within 25-29 years had the highest number in the sample,139 (21.09%), while those within 15-19 years had the lowest number in the sample, 38 (5.77%). Pregnant women with no education ranked highest in the sample, 296 (44.92%), while those with higher education were the lowest number, 50 (7.59%). More women lived in rural areas, 412 (62.52%) than in urban areas, 247 (37.48 %). Most pregnant women belong to the Islamic religion, 367 (55.69%), followed by other Christians, 219 (33.29%). Pregnant women who are currently married (i.e., married or living with a man as if they are married) were 394(90.14%) of the sample, while those who are not currently married (Never in a union, widowed, divorced, and no longer living together/separated) were65(9.86%). Women with positive attitudes towards persons living with HIV/AIDS were 402(61.00%), while those with negative attitudes were 257 (39.00%). Result of the Bivariate and Multivariable Regression Analysis of the Predictors' Association with Self-reported HIV Testing of Pregnant Women This study determined the predictors of HIV testing among pregnant women aged15-49 years in Nigeria. Knowledge of HIV status among pregnant women through HIV testing is an essential strategy for preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. It is also important for the reduction of HIV transmission among the general population. This study showed no significant association of age with HIV testing during antenatal visits or childbirth among pregnant women aged 15 - 49. Being older has been reported in other studies to be a predictor of uptake of HIV testing, Women with a higher level of education are more likely to test for HIV than those with no education in this study (AOR, 8.09; 95% CI: 2.97, 22.06). Ajayi et al., Ejigu and Tadesse, and Muyunda et al. corroborated this finding in their reports. Pregnant women dwelling in urban areas were 1.66 times more likely to test for HIV than those dwelling in rural areas in this study (AOR, 1.66; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.53). This finding is consistent with what was reported in similar studies Pregnant women of the Catholic and other Christian religions were statistically significantly more likely to test for HIV than those of the Islamic religion in the bivariate model, although the multivariable model did not corroborate it. Other studies have reported that religion significantly predicted HIV testing of pregnant women. This study found no significant association between self-reported HIV testing of pregnant women who are currently and not currently married. Although Muhinda and Pazvakawambwa and Muyunda et al. corroborated this finding that marital status was not significantly associated with the likelihood of testing for HIV, other studies reported that being currently married was significantly associated with testing for HIV. In this study, pregnant women with positive attitudes were not significantly more likely to test for HIV than those with negative attitudes during antenatal visits or childbirth (OR, 1.47; 95% CI: .57, 3.76). Meremo et al. and Ha et al. reported similar findings in their studies. A limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design of the NDHS study, which made it unattainable to establish causality between the predictors and the dependent variable of HIV testing. Also, data were collected in the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey through self-reports of the respondents, and therefore, recall bias of the respondents may have impacted this study's findings. Another limitation is the use of a mean cut-off score to categorize those with and without stigmatizing attitudes because those whose attitudes are close to the cut-off mean may be incorrectly grouped leading to skewed conclusions about the prevalence of stigmatization. Unmeasured confounding is another potential limitation because the study variables were restricted to the ones collected in the 2013 NDHS. This study found that educational level and place of residence predicted HIV testing of pregnant women aged 15-49 in both the bivariable and multivariable regression models. These identified predictors could be targeted in designing informed policies, strategies, and interventions to control the HIV epidemic among pregnant women aged 15-49 years in Nigeria. Also, more HIV testing centers should be made available and accessible to rural dwellers in Nigeria by the Government.","[' Antenatal Visits', 'HIV Testing', 'Predictors', 'Pregnant Women', 'Nigeria']",,Nigerian Medical Journal : Journal of the Nigeria Medical Association,AIDS
11470264,Use of Miconazole Cream As Adjunctive Therapy to Treat Isolated Sinus Mucormycosis: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Black fungus, also known as mucormycosis, is one of the most serious infections affecting immunocompromised individuals. Invasive fungal sinusitis due to mucormycosis is quite rare globally. Hence, this article presents a case report of invasive fungal sinusitis in a 53-year-old diabetic female who presented to the emergency department with a severe case of diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to acute sinusitis, which was confirmed by histopathology to be mucormycosis. An extensive surgical debridement and liposomal amphotericin B were the mainstay of treatment. The treatment of mucormycosis consists of treating the underlying disease, antifungal therapy, and surgical debridement. Also, previous studies have discussed the use of medical therapy alone, surgical therapy alone, and combination therapy. It was found that the combination of medical and surgical therapy was the most effective method in treating this condition. However, the high mortality rate of this disease indicates the need for a possible adjuvant therapy which could increase the survival rate. Therefore, recent studies have proposed new adjuvant modalities, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and local treatment with amphotericin B. In this study, we propose a new adjuvant therapy using local miconazole cream which showed a good prognosis with the combination of oral amphotericin B and surgical debridement. This highlights the necessity for extensive future clinical trials to validate its effectiveness in treating isolated sinus mucormycosis.","Black fungus, also referred to as zygomycosis and phycomycosis, was initially described by Paltauf in 1885 [ A 53-year-old female with a 20-year history of type 2 DM and on metformin presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of sore throat, decreased oral intake, and generalized fatigue. The patient was then admitted as a case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) secondary to acute sinusitis and oral thrush and was started on fluconazole. Two days preceding admission, she was noticed to have a fever (38.7 degrees) and she complained of pain on the left side of her face that radiated to her ears, for which she was started on clindamycin. There was no history of a recent infection, and her family history was unremarkable. Table  After 10 days of her admission, the patient was referred to the otolaryngology department for her complaint, that is, persistent facial pain/pressure on the left side and nasal dryness. There was no history of nasal obstruction, discharge, anosmia, headache, diplopia, or decreased vision. During the consultation, the patient was conscious, alert, afebrile, and vitally stable. However, she looked ill, fatigued, and dehydrated. Ocular examination showed that there was normal extraocular movement, no orbital or facial asymmetry, and no decreased facial sensation. In addition, the ear, nose, and throat examination showed hard wax in the right ear, otitis media with effusion in the left ear, and dry blackish secretions adhering to the septum and the middle turbinate of the nose. The rigid nasal endoscopy showed blackish discoloration and the crustation of the nasal septum (around 2 cm), the middle turbinate, and the lateral nasal wall. In addition, there was a nasopharyngeal asymmetry (Figure  A sinus computerized tomography (CT) scan without contrast was done and it showed a complete opacification of the anterior and posterior ethmoid, mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus, and a nasopharyngeal asymmetry (Figures  After 11 days of her admission, the further endoscopic nasal examination was conducted in the operating room under general anesthesia and a biopsy was taken from the nasal septum, the middle turbinate, the lateral nasal wall, and the nasopharynx and was sent for fungal culture. The fungal culture results revealed an isolated  After an 11-day period of using amphotericin, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to amphotericin use which was held for a period of 14 days and switched to clindamycin at a dose of 600mg every six hours. After controlling the AKI, amphotericin was restarted with daily monitoring of the renal function test (RFT), and meropenem at a dose of 500mg twice daily was added with a continuous crust removal every other day, although the patient did not improve in this regimen after 22 days. Hence, local miconazole cream twice per day was added, which showed a significant improvement after application for five weeks (Figure  During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the incidence of mucormycosis increased as a secondary infection of COVID-19. It is a rare form of infection, but it is considered one of the most serious infections affecting immunocompromised individuals. Nevertheless, few studies have reported the occurrence of mucormycosis in an immunocompetent healthy individual [ Few comprehensive studies have been conducted to analyze the exact pathogen that is linked to mucormycosis in the population. However, several pathogens of the  Mucormycosis is a rapidly progressing infection with a variety of clinical presentations, which makes early diagnosis difficult. The early presentation depends on the type of the disease, which can be divided into five types, rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, pulmonary mucormycosis, cutaneous mucormycosis, disseminated mucormycosis, and gastrointestinal mucormycosis. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common type, which affects the nasal and oral cavity, the sinuses, and the brain as seen in this case [ The overall survival rate for mucormycosis with cerebral involvement is 15%, while it is nearly 50% for patients with rhino-orbital infection [ The treatment of mucormycosis consists of three steps: treating the underlying disease, medical management with an antifungal agent, and surgical debridement. Previous studies reported the use of either just medical management or just surgical debridement; however, an antifungal agent in combination with surgical debridement was the most effective reported method for treating mucormycosis. Amphotericin B (5-10mg/kg/day) was the most common antifungal agent used with an average reported duration of 72 days [ Mucormycosis is a rare and life-threatening invasive fungal infection, which needs to be suspected in any diabetic or immunocompromised patient. Although the prognosis of this condition is poor, early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis and are vital to preventing fatality. Our patient was treated with a combination of surgery and medical therapy for 95 days after improvement. In this study, local miconazole cream was used as an adjunctive therapy for the first time in the literature. Thus, this highlights the necessity for extensive future clinical trials to validate its effectiveness.","['black fungus', 'fungal rhinosinusitis', 'fungal sinusitis', 'miconazole', 'mucormycosis']",,Cureus,AIDS
11470216,mHealth Apps for Hypertension Self-Management: Interview Study Among Patient-Users,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting over a billion people worldwide. Mobile health (mHealth) apps have emerged as effective tools for managing hypertension, offering capabilities for monitoring blood pressure, fostering lifestyle changes, and improving treatment adherence. This study aimed to explore patient-users’ perspectives on the hypertension care mHealth app Hypertension.APP, focusing on its accessibility, expected benefits, potential risks, and role in hypertension management in Germany. A qualitative study was conducted involving semistructured interviews with 20 patient-users of a hypertension care mHealth app, Hypertension.APP. Participants were recruited between January and June 2023 using purposive sampling. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Participants primarily discovered the app independently, driven by recent hypertension diagnoses and insufficient information from health care professionals regarding effective self-management strategies for their blood pressure. They valued the app for its continuous monitoring and feedback capabilities, aiding in understanding their condition and making lifestyle adjustments. Risks were perceived as minimal, mainly concerning data privacy and potential overreliance on the app. The app became integral to patient-users’ hypertension management by offering consistent information and support. The integration into formal health care was limited, as patient-users felt that health care professionals did not accept the use of the technology or might have even felt intimidated to use it. Among the sample studied, mHealth apps like Hypertension.APP were valued for their continuous monitoring and educational content, aiding in hypertension management. The findings suggest potential benefits of mHealth apps for effective hypertension care among patients who are health- and digitally literate as well as self-effective. There is a critical need for better integration of these apps into routine health care practices, as perceived by the app users. Given the small and specific sample of this qualitative study, further quantitative research with a broader and more varied participant group is necessary to validate these findings. Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS00029761; https://tinyurl.com/r33ru22s","Despite effective guideline-based prevention and treatment options, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide [ The recent increase in digital health technologies has opened new possibilities for the prevention and management of hypertension [ Despite the significant potential of mHealth apps in hypertension care, their integration into routine hypertension care in Germany is sporadic. This hesitance can be attributed to factors that are well-recognized in other medical fields. These include a lack of awareness of the benefits of mHealth apps [ However, this study did not focus on these barriers. Instead, we sought to understand the perspectives and experiences of individuals with hypertension who actively use mHealth, specifically, Hypertension.APP, to manage their condition. This user-centered approach could provide insights into the practicalities, determinants, and challenges faced by patients, thereby informing strategies to optimize mHealth app usage in hypertension care. Thus, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore user experiences with an mHealth app in hypertension care, focusing on app accessibility, expected benefits and perceived risks, and its role in hypertension care in Germany. We conducted a qualitative interview study on the perspectives of patient-users of an mHealth app for hypertension care. This study is part of the digital preventive measures for arterial hypertension (DiPaH) - project [ The app (Hypertension.APP) which patient-users were interviewed in this study was selected as an example according to expert recommendations (Prof Dr Martin Middeke and Prof Dr med Miklós Illyés). The Hypertension.APP is developed and maintained by the Hypertension Care UG (Ingolstadt) [ Visualization of the Hypertension.APP and its functions [ Patient-users were invited to participate in the study through the Hypertension.APP. A study invitation for the DiPaH study was placed in the app which led users to an online questionnaire survey and an online form for entering contact details for the interviews. The study team contacted people who had entered their contact details within 14 days and an interview appointment was arranged. Participants were selected using purposive sampling with the aim to include heterogeneous app users [ A preliminary semistructured interview guide was drafted by a multiprofessional team (FM, SM, EW, DB, and SS). The semistructured interview guide consisted of open-ended questions that explored participants’ motifs to use the Hypertension.APP, its usability, and the advantages and disadvantages of the app, as well as its impact on personal hypertension care. Sample interview questions included: (1) “Please remember. How did you come to use this app?” (2) “Please tell me, what do you think of the app?” (3) “What role does the app play in your hypertension care?” In addition, sociodemographics and health-related data were collected, including profession, sex, age, location (rural or urban), federal state, education, technical devices, blood pressure values, antihypertensive drugs, time since diagnosis, comorbidities, and tobacco use. To test the applicability of this guide, we conducted 3 pilot interviews (1 to 3). The interview guide ( Data were analyzed in parallel with the data collection by 2 experienced qualitative researchers (FM and SM). Analysis was based on Kuckartz’s structured qualitative content analysis [ The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane (E-02-20220620). The study was registered as part of the DiPaH project at German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00029761). Primary data collection was conducted in compliance with the current data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Helsinki declaration. Participants received extensive study information and provided written informed consent. Data were pseudonymized before analysis. No conclusions can be drawn about individuals in the presentation of results. Participants received €30.00 (US $33.07) as an incentive and compensation for their participation. Patients were not involved in designing this study. The manuscript has been compiled in accordance with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research;  A total of 20 interviews with 20 participants were conducted and were included in the analysis. The mean duration of the interviews was 26 (10-40) minutes. The mean age of the participants was 56 (range 29-80) years. In total, 10 females and 10 males were interviewed. Out of 20, 13 participants were located in an urban area (>20,000 inhabitants), whereas 7 were located in a rural area (<20,000 inhabitants). The systolic blood pressure level most frequently reported was 130-139 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was <80 mm Hg. Most of the participants (16/20) were on blood pressure-lowering medication. Half of the participants were diagnosed with hypertension 1-5 years ago. None of the participants were currently using tobacco, while 7 had used tobacco earlier. All participants of this study used the free version of the app.  Detailed characteristics of the study participants. A total of 4 key themes were explored in the analysis: (1) access to mHealth apps in hypertension care, (2) expected benefits of using mHealth apps in hypertension care, (3) potential risks of using apps in hypertension care, and (4) role of the app in hypertension care routines.  Coding tree of the qualitative content analysis. The participants reported that the diagnosis of high blood pressure was the initial reason for using the app: I actually came across it by chance. Because two years ago I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. And the doctor said that I should always measure my blood pressure and keep an eye on it. So I had a look to see if there were any little aids available. In the app store, right? Then I came across the app. It was also well-rated, right? And, yes, I downloaded it and, yes, it was also easy to use. And, I have actually been using the app ever since. And I always record my blood pressure. Regularly, right? The measurements. So that I can keep an eye on how it's developing. Does it go too high at first or is it too low? The participants recounted that they had discovered the app mostly on their own. They either searched directly for an app on hypertension in the app store or they searched for further information on hypertension and then became aware of the app through relevant websites. Interviewer: Do you remember how you came to use the app? Participant: I don't remember exactly. I looked at various apps in the app store and tried out which ones I got on well with, and then at some point I found the hypertension app, because it not only records, but also provides information about it. Interviewer: And you did it all on your own, without any advice from a doctor or anything like that? Participant: No, my doctor never said anything about the app. I looked for it myself. The participants recalled their dissatisfaction with the information provided by their treating HCPs concerning effective self-management strategies for blood pressure and undertook their own research endeavors. They independently searched for information on their condition to positively influence it through lifestyle changes. In doing so, they differentiated reliable sources from others. I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure at the beginning of the year which is still relatively recent, and I didn't really get any useful information from my GP. I felt a bit ill-advised or in bad hands, so I did some research on the Internet to find reliable sources and then came across the German Heart Foundation, where I ordered a magazine. It's called “Bluthochdruck, Herz und Gefäß schützen” [Engl.: High blood pressure, protecting the heart and blood vessels] and in this magazine this app was featured or advertised and that's how I came across this app.” The patients experienced no problems in downloading or installing the app. Overall, the methods by which the participants accessed the app demonstrated high levels of self-efficacy which was also reflected in the expected benefits of using the app. The main motivation for using the app was the desire to save and continuously monitor blood pressure values on a long-term basis and to provide a clear overview to organize one’s own lifestyle and make adjustments to it. This was in contrast to the selective blood pressure recording during doctor visits. (…) in order to monitor my values and then not only to selectively obtain values at doctor’s visits and get a snapshot or a 24-hour recording, but to actually be able to read certain trends and then act accordingly in everyday life. From the participants’ perspective, one advantage of documentation through the app over other types of documentation is that patient-users receive immediate explanations and feedback on their values. Yes, ultimately because I also get information and don't just read, “This is this number”, but what it means and what I can do. The app users relate this feedback directly to their lifestyle and adapt it if necessary. The app provides a basis for decisions regarding behavioral changes. And I look how it goes and how my blood pressure level developed and draw my conclusions from that. For example, I realize that stress is actually a factor that increases my blood pressure. I can see this quite clearly because I know what I have done and when. And yes, you cannot always avoid stress, but you can try to limit it. So this feedback is really helpful. Compared with analog and paper-based documentation types, the overview and convenience of documentation through the app were emphasized by the participants. Well, in the past it was important to me that I always wrote everything down by hand. So at the very beginning, yes, there was a little booklet from the blood pressure machine. But then the booklet was full. I just didn’t enjoy writing everything down by hand. And that immediately convinced me to enter this data. I do a lot on my smartphone. And yes, and that I can also see immediately whether I have hypertension or whether it’s the same and so on. So the values that I enter also give me immediate information about the status of things. So that convinced me immediately. The participants emphasized the importance of managing their illnesses independently. They reported that the app effectively helped them achieve this objective, particularly by controlling their blood pressure. Because I consider it important to have my blood pressure under control given my state of health. One app user also reported that the app enabled him to lead an independent life and that independent app-supported monitoring helped him visit the doctor less often. Because I lead a very unconventional life. It is imperative that I need as little medical help as possible. That is why I have to get a tight grip on my incipient illnesses – after all, I am 80 years old. I have to be in control of the situation. In addition to the perceived benefits, participants were also asked about potential risks of using the app. However, most participants did not perceive any risk when using the app. Some participants addressed the general risk of misuse of data by third parties: Well, I do see a risk that you enter health data here, of course. This is just the data protection risk. But not specifically in this app, it’s a general story. I think the app is relatively well-secured. And yes, the data can sometimes be hacked, okay. That always raises the question of who uses this data and for what? Furthermore, the participants reported a risk of excessive use of the app. Interviewer: Do you see any risks when using the app? Participant: Well, not for me. Maybe that you get too attached to the app. But that’s always the case with things like this. But I tend to forget that. In the interviews, the participants described the app as an essential element in the self-management of their own hypertension care routines. In contrast to conventional hypertension care, continuous availability of support and information was emphasized in the interviews. In some cases, the app was even personified and its use was described as a treatment. Well, all these things combined make for perfect prevention or even treatment. It is actually already a form of treatment, yes. Because look, how often do you visit your doctor? To my general practitioner maybe twice a year. So they always tell you the same. And that’s it, yes. But I need this support on a daily basis, yes. It [the app] is like a kind of companion, like a sparring partner basically, yes. And exactly, the app is my sparring partner because it also communicates with me. The app provides information to understand one’s condition. Participants described that the app supports communication with the medical staff and enables patient-users to express their needs. And as I said, the most important thing for me was to be taken seriously by the doctor. And when you engage more with your own illness, then you can, well, argue better. In addition, the interview participants reported that they had confidence in the app and regarded the information presented as reliable. Simultaneously, the significance that the user attaches to the app’s information is not acknowledged in the doctor’s office. Well, I must say, I trust the app and have already read the information, which is kept relatively concise, from the library. And yes, because I trust the app, as I have already mentioned, I take seriously what it shows me, to put it bluntly. And so, for me, that is trustworthy information. (…) And with this mild or slight diastolic hypertension, it then says, “Continue taking your blood pressure medication and consult a doctor to further optimize the medication or something in that direction.” Exactly, so I find it very valuable information. But I had the impression which might also be due to the individual doctor that the lady didn't take my concern to discuss the medication again very seriously. Similarly, another user suggested that the treating doctor might feel intimidated by the app or the information provided. The app is currently not integrated into the user’s medical hypertension care. So, in the general practitioner's office, it seems like the app has not really caught on there, I feel. If I were in the place of the general practitioner, I would really take it seriously. Of course, it is possible that the general practitioner might feel threatened by it. I don't know. (...) If I were in her shoes, I would have been more interested. She did say, “Oh that's great. And good that you're doing it.” But she didn't say, “Show me the app.” or anything like that... This qualitative study is the first to explore user experiences with an mHealth app in hypertension care, focusing on app accessibility, expected benefits, potential risks, and its role in hypertension care in Germany. The study showed that patient-users of the Hypertension.APP typically discovered the app independently, driven by a combination of a recent high blood pressure diagnosis and a lack of satisfactory information from their HCP. These patient-users particularly appreciated the app’s capabilities for continuous monitoring and documentation of blood pressure, as it offered valuable feedback and explanations, aiding them in understanding their condition and making informed lifestyle adjustments. While acknowledging these benefits, patient-users also noted potential risks concerning data privacy and the possibility of becoming overly reliant on the app, although they assigned relatively low importance to these concerns. The app has become an essential part of users’ disease management routines, providing consistent support and information that contrasts with low-frequency traditional doctor visits. Regarding the disappointment of app users, the integration of the app into formal health care settings was limited, with some patient-users sensing a lack of acceptance or even intimidation from the HCP toward the technology. Our results clearly indicate that mHealth can be a valuable tool for self-management of arterial hypertension. This finding is in concordance with existing research, underscoring the substantial potential and effectiveness of digital health [ While in other medical domains the use of digital technologies is associated with depersonalization or dehumanization of health care [ From a socio-technological perspective, our findings resonate with Bruno Latour's actor-network theory [ Notably, the participants expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of integration of mHealth into standard hypertension care. They advocated its inclusion in formal hypertension practices, stressing the need for HCPs to recognize and leverage these digital health tools. Why do German HCPs have reservations about mHealth in hypertension care? The reluctance of German HCPs toward mHealth in hypertension management is a multifaceted issue, as explored in a separate module of the DiPaH study [ It appears critical that patient-users of mHealth applications, especially those managing chronic diseases, receive serious attention and support from their HCPs. Therefore, potential users and stakeholders should be involved in the development of digital health applications. This was the case for the development of Hypertension.APP. However, there is currently a significant shortfall in the information resources available to HCPs which is crucial as there is evidence that HCPs’ knowledge of telemedicine is closely intertwined with their actual use of telemedicine services [ Looking ahead, the narratives from our interview participants suggest that they possessed a high level of self-efficacy and eHealth literacy, as well as a higher income and educational background. This observation raises critical questions about accessibility and equity: who is able to use these mHealth services effectively, and who is not? Based on interviews alone, we can only speculate; however, a more comprehensive analysis combining interview and questionnaire data would offer valuable insight into these dynamics. It could provide a clearer picture of the demographic profile of current patient-users of mHealth in hypertension care, and potentially identify groups that are currently underserved or unable to benefit from this digital health technology. This knowledge would be instrumental in developing strategies to make mHealth more accessible and effective for a broader range of patients, particularly those with chronic conditions, such as hypertension. While our study offers valuable insights, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. First, the inclusion of solely patient-users, particularly limited to one specific app may introduce selection bias, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. In addition, the perspectives of treating HCP, particularly GPs and cardiologists, warrant exploration in a separate study to provide a comprehensive understanding of hypertension management. Specifically, investigating the optimal integration of app data into the local electronic medical record and the workflow for HCPs is imperative, as this aspect could significantly influence their acceptance of digital hypertension care. In addition, our study may be susceptible to self-selection bias and social desirability bias, exacerbated by the provision of study incentives. Furthermore, the demographic composition of interview participants, predominantly consisting of highly educated nonsmokers, fails to fully represent the diverse population living with hypertension. The absence of reported issues during the download and installation of the app suggests that our sample might also possess higher levels of self-efficacy, eHealth literacy, and technical skills compared with the general population. This indicates a potential overestimation of these attributes in the broader community of hypertensive patients. Most participants had controlled blood pressure levels, with only a minority having systolic blood pressure >139 mm Hg and some not on medication. This may also have influenced the HCPs perceived need for mHealth based blood pressure monitoring. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the app used in our study lacks certification as a digital therapeutic (“Digitale Gesundheitsanwendung” or DiGA), limiting its integration into standard health care systems and reimbursement schemes. However, despite these limitations, our study stands as the first exploration of user experiences with an mHealth app for hypertension care in Germany. By closely examining the realities of care and patient perspectives, our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of digital self-management in hypertension care and highlight areas where further improvement is needed. Among the sample studied, mHealth apps like Hypertension.APP were highly valued for their continuous monitoring and educational content, which aids in hypertension management. The findings highlight the potential of mHealth apps for effective hypertension care among patients who are health- and digitally-literate, as well as self-effective. However, there is a critical need for better integration of these apps into routine health care practices, as perceived by the users. This includes addressing the skepticism and lack of acceptance among HCP, ensuring that they receive the necessary training and resources to effectively use these tools. Further research should also focus on the accessibility and effectiveness of mHealth apps across diverse patient populations to promote equitable health benefits.","['hypertension', 'mobile health', 'mHealth apps', 'digital health', 'patient perspective', 'qualitative study', 'cardiology']",2024-9-27,JMIR Formative Research,AIDS

Lack of detectable inbreeding depression contrasts to the findings for the nearby Cotter River Macquarie perch population, where the 2018 cohort (which was also born and lived its first year in stressful conditions of the lowest river flow), displayed a significant positive relationship between heterozygosity and growth, suggesting possible inbreeding depression (Pavlova et al.  Providing best‐practice management to the spatially large but genetically compromised upper Murrumbidgee Macquarie perch population is essential to ensure that it persists, that its unique genetic diversity is not lost through genetic drift, and that the overall recovery of this threatened species is promoted through gene exchange among the major catchments of the Murray–Darling Basin. Four key actions are strongly recommended. Of highest priority is improving connectivity among sites within the upper Murrumbidgee River, by providing adequate flow releases from Tantangara Reservoir and human‐mediated exchange of migrants among four genetic groups (Sites 1–3, Site 4, Site 5, and Sites 7–9). Continuing wild‐to‐wild translocations from other populations of the Murray–Darling Basin is also of highest priority. These actions are expected to reduce inbreeding and genetic drift and increase genetic diversity and hence fitness and evolutionary potential.

11470177,Integrating tailored approaches in perioperative care strategies for neurodivergent individuals,"Neurodivergent (ND) individuals exhibit variations in communication, behaviors, and cognition, which present both opportunities and challenges in healthcare settings. Anesthesiologists can offer personalized and compassionate care to ND patients throughout the surgical process. Yet, often, there is limited knowledge of the specific actions that anesthesiologists can take to build a healthcare environment that fully recognizes and meets the unique needs of ND patients. This document highlights the importance of integrating tailored communication and supportive strategies throughout the distinct stages of perioperative and intraoperative care.","“Neurodiversity” is a term that recognizes variations in brain function, highlighting the critical role diverse neurological profiles play in human society, analogous to the fundamental importance of biodiversity for sustaining life. Traditionally, ND conditions have been approached through a deficit-based model, wherein individuals are diagnosed and treated with medications or interventions to cure or minimize neurological differences. For ND patients, optimizing the surgical experience begins during the planning phase of care. Adaptive care plans, developed preoperatively in collaboration with a child-life specialist or a psychologist, offer a practical approach to assist and prepare ND patients for navigating surgical experiences. These plans also aid the medical team in establishing expectations and goals for the patient ( Another strategy is to bypass the crowded waiting room, allowing staff to check in the patient in a private space. In a comprehensive care plan, the patient's preferred communication style should be included, as discussed below. Ultimately, the goal of the preoperative visit and creation of an adaptive care plan is to develop individual strategies unique to each patient that provide ND individuals with appropriate support, understanding, and tailored healthcare services. The medical environment is a central factor that influences a patient's sense of self and overall well-being. Common misconceptions related to neurodivergent individuals. Empowering anesthesia providers: concrete strategies for neurodivergent patient care. Creating a safe and non-judgmental environment where patients feel comfortable is paramount. The rapid identification and support of neurodivergent patients can provide them with appropriate care, understanding, and tailored healthcare services. Preoperative planning presents an important opportunity to provide patient-centered support to reduce anxiety, increase predictability, and promote cooperation. During the preoperative evaluation of ND patients, it is crucial to identify and accommodate the patient's preferred communication style to enhance engagement and facilitate successful information exchange. These may include alternative communication methods, such as visual aids or assistive technologies. Miscommunication between ND patients and clinicians can arise from misinterpreting tone of voice and facial expressions. It is, therefore, vital to prioritize understanding  Preoperative evaluation of ND patients requires close attention to sensory issues, intending to minimize sensory overload. This includes adjusting lighting, controlling noise levels, reducing contacts, limiting the number of providers in and out of the room, and providing soothing tools like weighted blankets or headphones. Providing a separate information sheet or a personalized book with information about the surgery, anesthesia, and contact details for the preoperative clinic/team can help reduce anxiety and confusion when preparing ND patients for transitions in the perioperative setting. The collaborative involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including anesthesiologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, child life specialists, caregivers, and other medical specialties, is vital for comprehensive preoperative evaluation tailored to each ND patient. The combined expertise offers insights into cognitive, behavioral, and medical aspects, ensuring a thorough medical history review and understanding of specific conditions. Where applicable, collaboration with the patient's primary healthcare provider and caretaker is important to understand their medical requirements and developmental history. Anesthesia providers can optimize the operating room environment by reducing excessive stimuli, which may cause stress and overwhelm individuals with sensory issues. Explaining procedures beforehand can help ND individuals feel more comfortable during surgery. Placing an IV line before the procedure can be difficult. If needed, sedation should be discussed as an option for the patient. Premedication can help manage stress and sensory sensitivities ( In general, the anesthetic management for ND patients, specifically regarding medications, closely follows standard practices for NT patients, with no strong evidence suggesting differential responses to anesthetic medications in ND individuals. Postoperative care and transitions for ND patients require implementing personalized pain management strategies, recognizing non-verbal cues, developing alternative pain assessment methods, monitoring for adverse reactions, facilitating smooth transitions, and collaborating with the patient's support system. When deciding between a postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) bed or a bed on the ward for an ND patient, it is essential to consider the patient's medical condition, sensory issues, mobility, safety, caregiver support, and recovery plan. Alerting the postoperative care team to some of these issues may help reduce stress and anxiety for patients and their caregivers. Pain assessment encompasses cognitive, physiological, sensory, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors, making it a complex and subjective process. Self-report pain measurement tools like the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for adults and adolescents or a visual analog scale (VAS) (i.e.: Wong-Baker FACES) for children are considered the gold standard. For non-speaking or minimally verbal ND patients or patients with difficulty understanding or communicating their pain, validated behavioral/observation tools have been developed, including the Revised-Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (r-FLACC), It is important for clinicians to 1) identify the correct pain scale to use for the patient's developmental level and communication preferences; 2) avoid over-attributing behaviors (i.e.: rocking, flapping, etc.) solely to ND conditions and consider pain as a potential cause for an increase in self-stimulatory/regulation behaviors Individualized pain management strategies are essential as ND patients may display different pain thresholds and/or the ability to report verbally or visually on their internal states and pain experience. While some individuals may experience hyposensitivity and require less pain medication, others may experience hypersensitivity and significant pain. This requires a comprehensive approach beyond patient self-report. General instructions like “Come back if it gets worse” or “Watch out for swelling/redness” may leave ND patients uncertain about when to seek further medical attention. Introducing quantifiable metrics for adverse reactions to address this issue is helpful. For example, specific fever thresholds or predetermined redness areas provide explicit guidance, ensure accurate monitoring, and empower patients, caregivers, and other support persons. Pictures and written instructions should be used whenever possible. Follow-up care and long-term considerations for ND patients should involve collaboration with patients' support systems. Engaging with the patient and their family members, caregivers, or advocates can ensure the patient receives appropriate ongoing care and support. This collaboration should include comprehensive discharge planning, providing necessary resources, and educating the support system regarding the patient's needs and any potential challenges they may face during recovery. Anesthesia providers can enhance the care of ND patients by proactively recognizing and addressing their distinctive needs and preferences. Embracing neurodivergence in perioperative care is crucial for providing inclusive and effective healthcare to ND patients. Preoperative efforts should focus on destigmatization, optimized communication, sensory accommodations, and tailored care plans. Intraoperatively, minimizing sensory overload and stress can improve the surgical experience. Postoperatively, personalized pain management and smooth transitions, with input from the patient's support system, are essential. Integrating neurodivergent-informed practices ensures equitable treatment and enhances overall healthcare outcomes for ND individuals. By creating an environment that aligns seamlessly with the unique needs of ND patients, we can collectively foster an atmosphere that upholds their well-being and dignity at every stage of perioperative care. The proposed strategies may seem geared toward well-resourced settings, but many can be effectively applied in less resourced environments. These recommendations serve as a starting point and can be adapted to the specific needs and resources of each institution or country.

11470129,"Multi-scale analysis of urban forests and socioeconomic patterns in a desert city, Phoenix, Arizona","Understanding the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and urban forest structure is essential for directing resources to ensure equitable distribution of green space. Through a case study of a desert city, i.e., Phoenix, AZ, this study provides a novel application of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) in which we explore the spatially variable relationships between a wide array of socioeconomic indicators and urban forest attributes. Through the computation of various scales of influence for different explanatory variables, MGWR enhances our analysis’s precision and stresses the association between socioeconomic status and urban forest structure at local and regional scales. Our results indicate that although there has been a pattern of green inequality where minority and low-income communities have less access to urban forests, education levels were mostly insignificant based on the MGWR results. In some instances, higher incomes are negatively correlated with tree canopy coverage. Additionally, the stem density model outperformed the canopy coverage model in terms of prediction accuracy. This research adds a new dimension to urban forestry literature and emphasizes the value of customized urban planning strategies and the environmental justice implications of urban forestry, particularly in arid environments.","Urban forests, including parks, gardens, street trees, and greenways As a critical urban forest attribute, tree canopy cover is widely investigated in urban forest studies Existing literature has highlighted key linkages between urban forests and the socioeconomic status of residents. Socioeconomic indicators can affect the quality and quantity of nature in an urban environment where localized benefits of trees, parks, and other green spaces are often considered a key aspect of environmental justice Further, ethnicity was associated with the pattern of urban forest distribution. Neighborhoods with higher proportions of racial minorities had lower levels of urban tree canopy coverage and were less likely to gain tree canopy over time Previous studies mostly focused on using correlation analysis and global regression models to understand the relationships between urban forest characteristics and socioeconomic composition Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was a popular spatial statistics tool that allowed the relationship to vary spatially Considering these varying scales, the basic GWR was expanded and refined in its subsequent variant, the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression model (MGWR), which allowed for a more flexible approach to addressing local, regional, or even uniform spatial variations. The variations of spatial associations between the dependent variable and any independent variable can be explored by employing MGWR Hence, by coupling remote sensing and MGWR modeling, this paper examines the varying spatial scales of relationships between the spatial pattern of urban forests and socioeconomic factors at a neighborhood scale in Phoenix, Arizona. Specifically, we aim to (1) explore urban forest patterns and socioeconomic inequity; (2) understand the relationships between urban forest characteristics and socioeconomic indicators at varying spatial scales; and (3) compare the impacts of different urban forest characteristics on various socioeconomic groups. The study area is the city of Phoenix, located in Maricopa County, Arizona, which encompasses 911 block groups (Fig.  
 Study area located in Phoenix, Arizona. Tree canopy cover was extracted from the 2015 land use and land cover (LULC) map created by the Central Arizona–Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAPLTER) 
 Descriptive statistics of the urban forest characteristics. The socioeconomic data at the block group level were sourced from the 2010–2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimate 
 Descriptive statistics of socioeconomic variables. The statistical analysis proceeded in three phases. Firstly, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficients to quantify the bivariate relationships between the two urban forest attributes and socioeconomic indicators. We then conducted the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model to evaluate each socioeconomic variable’s contribution to the urban forest attributes. Thirdly, the GWR models were used to understand and visualize the local variations in the relationships. The mathematical representation of the GWR is where  The GWR permits the linkages between the response and predictor variables to vary throughout space rather than giving an “average” global estimate In MGWR, the bandwidth for each explanatory variable can differ, allowing the model to capture varying spatial scales at which different processes operate. The equation of MGWR includes an addition of variable-specific bandwidths where  Most urban forest studies have used canopy cover to represent forest structure. The term “Urban Tree Canopy” (UTC) refers to the layer of tree leaves, branches, and stems that cover the ground Figure

Table  Moreover, the MGWR results show that, with bandwidths of 71 for the PTCC model and 100 for the SD model, it can be assumed that socioeconomic factors influence urban forest structure within a fixed spatial context. These variations in bandwidths illustrate that MGWR provides a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the spatial heterogeneity in the relationships between socioeconomic factors and urban forest attributes. The ability of MGWR to reveal different scales of influence for different variables suggests it is more suited for this study as it can accommodate the complex, multi-scaled nature of urban socio-ecological systems. 
 Mean significant coefficient estimates from MGWR. Table  
 Performance comparison among OLS, GWR, and MGWR models. The MGWR model’s incorporation of different bandwidths for each explanatory variable is a novel computational approach that allows nuanced spatial analyses. Bandwidths serve as a tuning parameter that defines the spatial context in which local regression coefficients are estimated. By enabling each predictor to have a distinct bandwidth, the MGWR model becomes highly adaptive, adjusting to the spatial heterogeneity inherent in the data. This adaptability is essential for capturing the complex, multi-scale spatial relationships between predictors and the response variable. In this study, the bandwidth values varying from 1 to 911 offer a spectrum of spatial resolutions from very local to essentially global, where lower bandwidth values capture finer, local variations, and higher values encompass broader, more global patterns across the study area. The use of a bandwidth of 911 effectively transforms the MGWR into a global regression model, smoothing out local variations and focusing on overarching spatial trends. The division of variables into local, regional, and global categories based on their bandwidths is a methodological advancement that aids in interpreting spatial processes. By setting a bandwidth threshold of 100 to demarcate local from regional variables, this study offers a pragmatic and context-sensitive approach to categorizing spatial influences. Figure  
 PTCC ( Figure  Conversely, the SD model’s bandwidth of 440 positions the percentage of Hispanic or Latino residents as a regional variable. This broader bandwidth indicates that the percentage of the Hispanic or Latino population affects SD over a more extensive area, which is evident in Fig.  
 PTCC ( Figure  Correlation analysis alongside OLS findings indicates a positive relationship between PTCC and median household income, hinting at a potential socioeconomic gradient in urban forestry distribution (Tables

 PTCC ( The current state of Phoenix’s urban forest is a pressing concern due to its low tree canopy coverage compared to the urban tree cover average globally (26.5%) In Phoenix, urban heat island effects disproportionately impact low-income communities, while affluent neighborhoods experience lower temperatures In this investigation, we employed correlation analysis, OLS, GWR, and MGWR models to examine the interplay between urban forest characteristics and socioeconomic indicators within the diverse metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona. The correlation and OLS outcomes offer a comprehensive overview of the associations between PTCC and SD and the socioeconomic variables across the study area. Notably, marginalized and low-income communities need more access to natural amenities. Furthermore, in the MGWR results, communities with a greater abundance of trees and shrubs demonstrated a positive correlation with higher educational attainment, housing densities, and median household income. Except for the educational background, these observations align with prior studies, underscoring the unequal distribution of trees, with neighborhoods characterized by lower income or predominantly comprising people of color exhibiting diminished tree cover MGWR gives a more detailed view of the coefficient estimates and their spatial variation at different scales. Figures  
 Spatial distribution of the percent of residents that are White ( Income is another essential indicator that has been discussed a lot in previous studies. Urban forests are unequally distributed, with lower-income communities having less urban tree cover. Gerrish and Watkins (2018) conducted a study to discuss the relationship between urban forest and income. Their results revealed significant income-based inequity in urban forest and the inequity was robust across most method choices As our results suggest, housing density positively correlates with both PTCC and SD. It is reasonable that trees can increase the properties’ aesthetic and economic values Previous literature has consistently shown a positive correlation between higher education levels and PTCC, suggesting that areas with a more educated population tend to have more tree coverage By applying MGWR, which considers spatial heterogeneity, we found the education-PTCC association vanishes, highlighting Phoenix’s unique spatial dynamics. However, significant correlations between education level and SD in certain block groups were observed, suggesting that while education does not influence overall canopy coverage, it impacts tree density in specific neighborhoods. MGWR’s ability to detect these localized patterns emphasizes its utility in studying urban forestry, aiding targeted interventions in city planning. This study’s findings suggest a strategic approach to tree planting in Phoenix is necessary, especially given a decline in tree cover from 2010 to 2015. The Phoenix government’s plan to educate residents about the benefits of urban trees is crucial, as it recognizes that simply increasing tree cover is not a perfect solution for disparity. A differentiated strategy, informed by this study’s results and mindful of local financial and policy constraints, can lead to more cost-effective interventions. Spatial scale is a fundamental concept in geographical studies, yet there needs to be more methodological advancements for measuring geographic scale across different processes. Previous research highlights GWR as vital for understanding local relationships In the MGWR analysis, the substantial variation in bandwidths for the independent variables across both PTCC and SD models signifies that each socioeconomic factor interacts with the urban forest attributes at different spatial extents. Several studies discuss the relationships at varying scales using the definition ‘global, regional, and local’ MGWR’s varied bandwidths underscore the need for tailored urban forestry policies. Localized bandwidths indicate the necessity for targeted interventions to combat environmental injustice, whereas broader bandwidths call for more general policy implementation. This highlights the heterogeneity of socioeconomic factors that may impact on urban forests and the importance of multi-scaled approaches in urban forestry research and planning. The significant bandwidth variations between socioeconomic variables in the PTCC and SD models emphasize considering diverse indicators in assessing and addressing urban forest structure and distribution. Additionally, while multiple spatial scales are well-addressed, temporal scales are limited. Current models, like spatiotemporal weighted regression (STWR) This study focused on the socioeconomic indicators influencing urban forest structure in a desert city like Phoenix, which revealed several significant insights into the interplay between urban greenery and socioeconomic composition at the neighborhood level. This research is particularly pertinent given the unique environmental context of desert cities, which are currently understudied in urban forestry literature. One of the key contributions is the novel application of MGWR, a computational spatial statistical method, in urban forest management and planning. Through applying MGWR, we could discern the varying spatial relationships between socioeconomic factors and urban forest attributes. This nuanced approach allows different explanatory variables to operate at different scales and has led to more accurate and detailed insights than possible with traditional, single-scale methods. The MGWR analysis has highlighted the complex, multi-scale nature of urban socio-ecological systems, especially in a desert urban setting like Phoenix. Furthermore, the inclusion of SD alongside the more commonly used PTCC as indicators of urban forest structure has provided a more comprehensive understanding of urban greenery. This underlines the importance of considering multiple facets of urban forests in environmental justice studies. Nevertheless, the availability of SD data varies significantly from city to city. While some cities have comprehensive tree inventories, others may lack such high-resolution datasets, necessitating primary data collection efforts to ensure spatiotemporal consistency and reliability in future analyses. Our findings indicate a pronounced inequality in urban tree distribution, with minority and low-income communities having reduced access to urban trees at multi-scales. This is a critical finding, emphasizing the need for equitable urban planning and policy-making that ensures all residents benefit from urban greenery while reiterating the presence of environmental injustice (e.g. Nelson et al. (2021) The study conclusively demonstrates the effectiveness of MGWR in urban forest analysis, especially in understanding the multi-scale and localized nature of socioeconomic impacts on urban greenery. It reiterates the need for urban forestry research to adopt multi-scale analytical approaches to accurately capture urban ecosystems’ complex dynamics. In summary, this study contributes to urban forestry literature by introducing new insights into the socioeconomic influences on urban forests in an arid urban setting. It highlights the necessity for context-specific, multi-faceted, and equitable approaches in urban forestry planning and policy. The unique findings from Phoenix reveal the importance of extending urban forestry research to diverse environmental contexts, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in urban green space management statement aided by using remotely sensed imagery and advanced spatial modeling methods (e.g., MGWR).","['Urban Forest', 'Urban Tree Inequality', 'Multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR)', 'Desert City', 'Socioeconomic scenarios', 'Sustainability']",2024-10-11,Scientific Reports,AIDS
11470122,Effectiveness of Papain-Based Organic Dentifrices Versus Commercial Whitening Dentifrice on Tea-Induced Tooth Stains: An In Vitro Study,"Introduction: Tooth discoloration is a common issue for oral health practitioners. Whitening treatments remove surface and deep stains using either chemicals or over-the-counter products. Due to harmful chemical effects, organic whitening products are increasingly preferred. This study compared the effectiveness of organic papain-based dentifrices (Perfora Magic Teeth Whitening Serum, Gurugram, India) on tea stains to commercially available Colgate whitening dentifrices (Colgate-Palmolive, New York, NY). Methods: Sixty maxillary central incisors for periodontal reasons were used and divided into two groups. Each sample was soaked in freshly brewed tea for 10 minutes daily and stored in artificial saliva (Nanochemazone, Kurukshetra, India) for 24 hours. After four weeks, group 1 was treated with papain-based dentifrices, and group 2 with Colgate Visible White teeth whitening paste (CVWP) daily for four weeks. Spectrophotometric analysis (VITA Easyshade V, VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) was performed pre-treatment and at four weeks post-treatment. Data were compiled and statistically analyzed. Results: Compared with group 1, group 2 exhibited an optimal color change (ΔE). Statistically significant differences were observed between the mean ΔL (lightness) and Δb (blueness -b or yellowness +b) values. Conclusion: CVWP showed better color achievement and stain reduction due to abrasive and peroxide components. Although Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum has low efficacy in upgrading the color of the enamel surface, it is safe for long-term use.","In modern society, having natural teeth and a perfect smile is a prerequisite for visual appeal. People may find it uncomfortable when their natural teeth become discolored. Tooth discoloration is primarily due to intrinsic or extrinsic stains, the underlying causes of which include various health conditions that develop either before or after birth, such as fluorosis or tetracycline stains [ Oral health professionals frequently encounter tooth discoloration. Discoloration can be treated using various in-office procedures, including scaling, abrasive paste polishing, bleaching, and veneer or crown construction [ Study design The present in vitro experimental study was conducted at the Department of Public Health Dentistry from January 2024 to July 2024. The study followed the adaptive Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) [ The inclusion criteria were sound (caries-free and restoration-free) maxillary central incisor teeth extracted for periodontal reasons. Teeth with caries, developmental defects, enamel discoloration, cracks, fractures, or calcifications were excluded from the study. The sample size was calculated using G power software version 3.16. Considering a medium effect size of 0.5, 60 samples were obtained at 80% power and an alpha error of 5% [ Sample preparation and staining methods Sixty extracted human maxillary central incisor specimen were equally divided into two groups. Each sample was assigned an individual code using the block randomization method. Debris, calculus, and soft tissue remains were removed from the tooth surfaces using an ultrasonic scaler (Scaler P7, Dentmark, Ludhiana, India). The samples were disinfected with a sodium hypochlorite solution (Denpro Hyposol 3%, Prevest, Jammu, India) for 30 minutes. The teeth were polished with a prophylaxis paste (Denpro Spectra, Prevest, Jammu, India) to eliminate any previously developed extrinsic stains on the tooth surfaces. Subsequently, the samples were kept in a designated group compartment to prevent specimen shuffling. Tea extract preparation and immersion The tea extract solution was prepared by dissolving 9 g of tea powder (Red Label, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Mumbai, India) in 200 mL of boiling water at 100°C. The water temperature was standardized using a portable digital probe thermometer (Romson, Delhi, India) (Figure  The tea extract was cooled to 85°C before sample immersion to mimic the typical temperature of a tea serving [ Brushing protocol After four weeks of the staining procedure, the brushing of each sample was scheduled. The recommended brushing duration was two minutes, and the maximum amount of time a single tooth was in contact was 12 seconds [ It included a circular brush head with 16-degree angled bristles that operated in three different ways: oscillating, rotating, and pulsing. Brushing strokes were applied as suggested by the manufacturer and were standardized for all specimens. Brushing was also done for four weeks. Spectrophotometric analysis and data collection A digital spectrophotometer (VITA Easyshade V, VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) was used to measure the color on a white background (Figure  The samples were dried using blotting paper prior to color assessment. To hold the teeth in place while they underwent spectrophotometric examination, a thick mold and steel scale were utilized. The central area of the crown on the buccal surface was selected to focus on spectrophotometric readings and standardization for pre- and post-treatment comparisons. The L* a* and b* values (L* indicates lightness, a* is the red/green coordinate, and b* is the yellow/blue coordinate) were measured at baseline (T0) before brushing and after four weeks of brushing (T1). Color changes from tea staining (ΔEpre) to the whitening process (ΔEpost) were calculated using the CIEDE2000 (La Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage) L*a*b* system with the CIE standard illuminant [ Statistical analysis The collected data were entered into an MS Excel sheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) for statistical analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). Quantitative data were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution. Pre- and post-treatment data were compared using two-way paired t-tests, and intergroup comparisons were made using independent t-tests. The significant value for alpha was set to 0.05. The study assessed the changes in color parameters (L* a* b*, and E) before and after treatment in the two groups. In group 1, there was a significant increase in the mean L* value from 67.42 ± 3.06 pre-treatment to 72.72 ± 3.94 post-treatment, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference ranging from -7.77 to -2.82 (p = 0.001, effect size = 1.53). The a* value showed a significant decrease from 4.56 ± 0.90 to 1.71 ± 0.42, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference of 2.28 to 3.42 (p = 0.001, effect size = 3.58). The b* value showed no significant change (p = 0.694, effect size = 0.12). The E value significantly increased from 73.94 ± 3.49 to 78.54 ± 5.70, with a CI for the mean difference between -8.25 and -0.94 (p = 0.019, effect size = 0.89). In group 2, the L* value significantly increased from 70.02 ± 4.30 pre-treatment to 81.15 ± 4.74 post-treatment, with a CI for the mean difference between -13.45 and -8.81 (p = 0.001, effect size = 3.43).

Finally, the E value significantly increased from 75.98 ± 3.41 to 84.66 ± 3.99, with a CI for the mean difference between -10.71 and -6.64 (p = 0.001, effect size = 3.05) (Table  The L* value represents the lightness of the color from 0 to 100, the a* value represents the position of the color between green (-) and red (+), the b* value represents the position of the color between blue (-) and yellow (+), and E represents the Euclidean distance in the color space. †Paired t-test (p < 0.05: significant) Data are presented as mean ± SD. SD: standard deviation The study compared the color change in parameters (ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, and ΔE) between two groups. For ΔL*, group 1 had a mean change of 5.3 ± 3.45 with a standard error (SE) of 1.09, a coefficient of variation of 0.65, and a Cohen's d value of -1.74. Group 2 showed a higher mean change of 11.13 ± 3.23 with an SE of 1.02 and a coefficient of variation of 0.29. The difference in ΔL* between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.001). For Δa*, group 1 exhibited a mean change of -2.85 ± 0.79 with an SE of 0.25 and a coefficient of variation of -0.27, while group 2 had a slightly higher mean change of -3.3 ± 1.01 with an SE of 0.32 and a coefficient of variation of -0.30. The difference in Δa* between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.284), with a Cohen's d of 0.49. For Δb*, group 1 had a mean change of -0.78 ± 6.07 with an SE of 1.92 and a high coefficient of variation of -7.79, compared to group 2, which had a mean change of -5.35 ± 3.16, an SE of 1.00, and a coefficient of variation of -0.59. The difference in Δb* was statistically significant (p = 0.049) with a Cohen's d of 0.94. Lastly, for ΔE, group 1 demonstrated a mean change of 4.59 ± 5.11 with an SE of 1.61 and a coefficient of variation of 1.11, whereas group 2 showed a mean change of 8.67 ± 2.83 with an SE of 0.89 and a coefficient of variation of 0.32. The difference in ΔE between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.041), with a Cohen's d value of -0.98 (Table  The ΔL* value represents the difference in post- and pre-treatment lightness of the color, the Δa* value represents the difference in post- and pre-treatment position of the color between green and red, the Δb* value represents the difference in post- and pre-treatment position of the color between blue and yellow, and ΔE represents the change in the Euclidean distance. †Independent t-test (p<0.05: significant) Data are presented as mean ± SD. SD: standard deviation The common causes of extrinsic staining of teeth are red wine, coffee, and tea. Experimentally, tea stains can be easily produced in vivo or in vitro and studied [ Both treatments significantly improved lightness (L*) and reduced redness (a*), with CVWP causing a more substantial change. It also reduced yellowness (b*), which did not significantly change in the Perfora group. Both treatments showed a significant overall color change (E value), with CVWP having a larger effect size, indicating a more noticeable difference in tooth color after treatment. CVWP's treatment was more effective at lightening teeth, reducing yellowness, and producing a greater overall color change. This might be due to the fact that the main constituents of CVWP include pyrophosphate silica, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium fluoride, sodium hydroxide, and titanium dioxide. The main advantages of titanium dioxide are its high refractive index, brightness, and resistance to discoloration. Hydrated silica is a medium-hard abrasive that aids in stain removal, and sodium lauryl sulfate is a surfactant that inhibits the adhesion of particles to the tooth surface [ Over-the-counter products are easily available on the market at low cost, but the harmful effects of these products such as gum irritation and tooth sensitivity remain unaltered. However, chemical dentifrices with peroxides are not suitable for long-term use. Studies have shown that the relative dentine abrasiveness of whitening dentifrices varies depending on the composition of the paste and the usage period [ A clinical study showed that papain and bromelain enzymes are more effective than abrasive whitening of dentifrices. The abrasive action of the toothbrush removes the outer stained plaque but does not change the color of the teeth. Papain is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down the protein pellicle on the surface of teeth and removes stains that impart color change [ The present study showed that the Δb* value was significantly lower in Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum than in CVWP, as it contains CI 42090, which gives a blue color, and a blue color on the teeth can counteract the yellow stains on the surface and make teeth appear whiter [ Although Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum has low efficacy in upgrading the color of the enamel surface, it is safe for long-term use. CVWP contains titanium dioxide and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which can increase surface roughness, gum irritation, and sensitivity [ Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum is devoid of titanium dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium fluoride, and sodium hydroxide and is safe and certified for use in safe cosmetics in Australia. In contrast to SLS, they use less irritating surfactants such as cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium methyl cocoyl taurate and an alternative to sodium fluoride; they use nano-hydroxyapatite, which is biocompatible and does not induce toxicity, such as the issue of overexposure and ingestion of fluoride, known as fluorosis. Moreover, the gel form of Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum allows it to reach the proximal surface of teeth more easily than abrasive toothpaste [ Strengths of the present study The key strength of the present study was the use of a spectrophotometer for color assessment, which is a more reliable method than the visual method. The study also reports effect sizes (Cohen's d), confidence intervals, and p-values, which strengthen the interpretation of the findings by quantifying the magnitude of the effects and the precision of the estimates. Overall, the study's strengths lie in its robust design, objective measurements, and comprehensive statistical analysis, which together provide reliable, quantifiable results about the effects of the two whitening treatments. Limitations The limitation of the study was primarily an in vitro procedure that could not have a realistic oral environment. Only one type of stain was studied in the present research (tea stain). Along with the assessment of change in the color of surface enamel, the susceptibility of the tooth surface to stain after brushing with dentifrice could also be done. Further studies are warranted in this context. Papain- and bromelain-based dentifrices hydrolyze the protein pellicle on the tooth surface and reduce the staining of teeth, but the CVWP showed better color achievement and stain reduction due to abrasive and peroxide components. Compared with chemical dentifrices, nonabrasive dentifrices with enzymatic mechanisms are useful for longer spans without harming the tooth surface. The present study showed that the ΔL* (lightness) of the enamel surface achieved by CVWP was better than that achieved by Perfora. However, the Δb* value was significantly lower in Perfora Teeth Whitening Serum than in CVWP.","['bromelain', 'papain', 'spectrophotometry', 'tea', 'tooth bleaching']",,Cureus,AIDS

Traditional antibiotic treatments raise concerns over drug resistance and environmental contamination. We explored the therapeutic potential of a compound extract from  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-73034-2.","Lamb diarrhea stands as a critical issue in veterinary medicine, with multifactorial etiologies leading to substantial morbidity and mortality among affected animals In this context, the therapeutic potential of traditional herbal medicines has garnered significant interest To address this gap, our study embarked on a comprehensive investigation into the effects of a compound extract formulated from YQL and SKZ on  UPLC-MS/MS analysis detected a total of 1472 compounds in the herbal compound, which were classified into 11 classes. The contents of lipids, organic acids, and alkaloids in SKZ were higher than those in YQL, while that of flavonoids in YQL was higher than that in SKZ (Fig.  UPLC-MS/MS analysis of the berbal compound. ( To investigate the effect of the YQL-SKZ compound on mice infected with  Pathological analysis of mouse intestinal tissues. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to visualize the intestinal tissues, and measurements were taken for villus height, crypt depth, and the villus-to-crypt ratio. Control represents the blank control group, Positive represents the positive control group, High represents the high-concentration treatment group, Medium represents the medium-concentration treatment group, and Low represents the low-concentration treatment group. Further analysis involved measuring the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of mice treated with various concentrations of the compound. We found that compound administration significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, sigA, and TNF-α in mouse serum ( Levels of intestinal inflammatory factors and genes involved in mucosal repair. ( To delve deeper into the effects of the compound on improving the intestinal condition in mice with diarrhea, we conducted 16 S rRNA sequencing on the intestines of mice treated differently. Correlation analysis between samples revealed correlation coefficients exceeding 0.95 for all three replicates of each treatment, indicating strong consistency between replicates and suggesting good reproducibility of the samples (Fig.  Sample correlation and diversity analysis. ( To explore the impact of different treatments on the microbial community composition, we visualized the relative abundances of microbial taxa at phylum and genus levels using stacked bar charts. At the phylum level, the abundances of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria accounted for over 90% of the microbial composition across all groups. In the blank control group, Firmicutes were the predominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes. Conversely, in the positive control group and in mice treated with high and medium concentrations of the compound, Bacteroidetes were the most abundant, followed by Firmicutes. Additionally, all the three treatment groups exhibited higher levels of Proteobacteria compared with the blank control group. The low-concentration group displayed a significant difference in microbial abundance from other treatments, showing the highest abundance of Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Fig.  Analysis of intestinal microbial species composition. ( Further analysis revealed that the abundance of Actinobacteria (Fig.  To gain deeper insights into the effect of compound treatment on the composition of the intestinal microbiome, pairwise differential comparisons were conducted between the three compound treatment groups and both blank and positive control groups. Significant microorganisms were selected based on |logFC| ≥ 1 and FDR < 0.05, and the results were visualized in a scatter plot. We identified 792, 905, 664, and 721 significantly differential microorganisms when the blank control group was compared with the positive control group, high-concentration group, medium-concentration group, and low-concentration group, respectively. Meanwhile, 717, 581, and 509 significantly differential microorganisms were detected in pairwise comparisons between the positive control group and the high-, medium-, and low-concentration groups, respectively (Fig.  Differential microbial analysis and functional analysis of intestinal of intestinal microbiota. ( Additionally, two pathways were common across three comparison pairs, with shigellosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathways upregulated in both low and medium-concentration groups. However, in the high-concentration group, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was upregulated, while shigellosis was downregulated. Nine unique pathways were identified in the low-concentration group, including flavonoid biosynthesis, African trypanosomiasis, xylene degradation, chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, limonene and pinene degradation, non-homologous end-joining, and toluene degradation, among others (Fig.  Comparing pathways across comparison pairs revealed that African trypanosomiasis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and  These findings demonstrated that compound treatments significantly influenced the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiome in mice. Specifically, the high-concentration group showed the most significant difference in microbial abundances and the low-concentration group exhibited the highest number of differentially abundant KEGG metabolic pathways when compared with both the blank and positive control groups. To further understand the differences in intestinal microbial composition among groups, Venn and LEfSe analyses were performed. The results of Venn analysis showed that the numbers of microbial species uniquely expressed in the blank control, positive control, high-concentration, medium-concentration, and low-concentration groups were 2743, 2716, 2896, 1926, and 1315, respectively, with 55 microbial species commonly expressed across all groups. Observation of the number of shared microbial species between groups revealed the highest number shared between the positive control and high-concentration groups, totaling 516 species. This was followed by 346 species shared between the blank control and positive control groups, and 301 species shared between the medium and low-concentration groups. The lowest numbers were shared when the low-concentration group was compared with both the positive and blank control groups, with 26 and 13 species detected, respectively (Fig.  Group-specific taxonomic signature analysis of mouse intestinal microbiota. ( The results of LEfSe analysis identified 3 phyla, 6 classes, 9 orders, 15 families, and 23 genera among the five groups. In the blank control group, genera such as  To reveal the impact of compound treatment on the intestinal environment of mice, UPLC-MS/MS analysis was conducted on the feces from mice, and SCFAs were relatively quantified. The results indicated that hexanoic acid had a higher level in the blank control group and was significantly higher than in other groups. Acetic acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, propionic acid, and isobutyric acid were significantly higher in the high-concentration group compared with other groups. Acetic acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, propionic acid, and isobutyric acid also exhibited higher levels in the low-concentration group (Fig.  Metabolomic analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). ( To understand the differential changes in fatty acids caused by compound treatment, further analysis was conducted by comparing each treatment group with the blank and positive control groups, selecting significant SCFAs based on VIP > 1 and FDR < 0.05. Compared with the blank control group, the positive control, high, medium, and low-concentration groups had 5, 6, 5, and 4 differential SCFAs, respectively. In contrast, compared with the positive control group, the high, medium, and low-concentration groups each exhibited seven differential SCFAs (Fig.  To uncover the changes of physiological and biochemical processes in  Enrichment analysis of SCFAs. From this analysis, we discovered that compared with the blank control group, the positive control group was primarily enriched in pathways like protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, propanoate metabolism, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis - heparan sulfate/heparin, and cholinergic synapse. The high-concentration group was mainly enriched in protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, propanoate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism pathways. The medium-concentration group were primarily enriched in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and protein digestion and absorption pathways. The low-concentration group was primarily enriched in protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, propanoate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism pathways. Compared with the positive control group, the high, medium, and low-concentration groups predominantly enriched in protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and propanoate metabolism, etc. To further elucidate the relationship between changes in gut microbiota and differential metabolism induced by compound treatment in mice, a correlation analysis was conducted between the abundances of microbial taxa and SCFAs. Selection criteria were set to a correlation coefficient (cor) > 0.95 and  Correlation analysis of gut microbiota and SCFAs in mice. YQL and SKZ are traditionally used to treat a variety of ailments, such as gastrointestinal disorders and inflammation Villus height and crypt depth are considered indicators of the intestinal absorptive function and are commonly used to assess intestinal health Significant reductions in the levels of inflammatory cytokines were observed in the high- and low-concentration groups, indicating a substantial role of the compound in improving mouse inflammation. An increase in inflammation markers in the medium-concentration group may suggest that concentration disparities significantly affected its therapeutic efficacy, necessitating further refinement in actual practice. Additionally, increased levels of mucosal repair genes  Analysis of the intestinal microbiota composition across groups revealed shifts in microbial community structure, with the high and medium-concentration groups displaying a composition similar to that of the positive control group. This similarity could be due to the compound influence on intestinal osmotic pressure at higher concentrations. Additionally, the abundance changes of microbes such as Actinobacteria,  When comparing treatment groups with both the blank and positive control groups, the high-concentration group showed a significantly higher number of bacterial species than the other two concentration groups. However, in the differential microbial KEGG enrichment analysis, the low-concentration group had a higher number of enriched pathways than the other two concentration groups. This may suggest that while the high concentration exerted a more potent effect, its action might be more specific. The low concentration stimulated microbial participation in a broader range of physiological functions. Compared with the blank control group, pathways such as chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene degradation, calcium signaling pathway, and D-Arginine and D-ornithine metabolism were significantly enriched in the three compound treatment groups, indicating that the compound treatment played a crucial role in substance synthesis, harmful substance degradation, and signal transduction functions. Compared with the positive control group, compound treatment promoted mouse cyanoamino acid metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, D-arginine and ornithine metabolism, betalain biosynthesis, and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells among other physiological processes, underscoring its significant role in promoting amino acid metabolism, substance synthesis, and intestinal cell barrier-related physiological functions. Furthermore, compared with the positive control group, all the three compound treatment groups were enriched in the shigellosis pathway, with a significant downregulation in the high-concentration treatment. SCFAs are essential not only as nutrients absorbed and utilized by the body but also for maintaining the health of the intestines, body, and brain Through microbiome and metabolome correlation analysis, several microbes were identified to be associated with changes in SCFAs. It is speculated that compound treatment regulates the levels of SCFAs in the intestine by causing differential expression of microbial genera such as  The aerial parts of dried YQL and stem bark of dried SKZ were purchased from the local herbal medicine market. An appropriate amount of YQL or SKZ was ground into powder and sieved through 100 mesh. The obtained powder was soaked in 60% ethanol for 20 min, and subjected to ultrasonic treatment before overnight soaking. After the residue was removed, the filtrate was transferred to a rotary evaporator. The herb liquid was concentrated to half at 60℃ at 30 rmp/min, and then increased to 60 rmp/min until a thick extract was achieved. This extract was then placed in a tray and frozen for over 4 h in an ultra-low temperature freezer. The extract was converted into dry powder form by using a freeze dryer. Our preliminary experiment showed that when YQL and SKZ were mixed at 4:1 (w/w), the herb compound exhibited the optimal effect against  The UPLC-MS/MS analysis of YQL and SKZ was conducted separately following the same protocols. Approximately 50 mg of sample powder mixed with 1200 µL of pre-cooled 70% methanol. The mixture underwent vortex mixing every 30 min for 30 s each time, 6 times in total. After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm/min for 3 min, with the supernatant subsequently filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane for UPLC-MS/MS analysis. For mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization source temperature was set at 550 °C. Ion spray voltage (IS) was set at 5500 V (positive ion mode)/-4500 V (negative ion mode); gas settings I, II, and curtain gas were set at 50, 60, and 25 psi respectively, with collision-induced dissociation parameters set to high. QQQ scans were performed using Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode, with collision gas (nitrogen) set to medium. Further optimization of declustering potential and collision energy (CE) was carried out to optimize DP and CE for each MRM ion pair. A specific set of MRM ion pairs was monitored during each period based on the eluting metabolites in each period.

Blood samples were collected from mice via retro-orbital bleeding 12 h after the last gavage administration. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm/min for 15 min, obtaining serum. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, sIgA, and TNF-αin serum were then determined using an Elasa kit (YuanJu Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Intestinal tissues were transferred to 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4℃ after homogenization. Total RNA was extracted from the obtained supernatant using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was then immediately reverse transcribed into cDNA with the All-in-One First-Strand Synthesis Master Mix (with dsDNase) (Yugong Biolabs, Jiangsu, China).

11470466,Early use of professional interpreters improves trauma outcomes: Results of a single-center retrospective study,"Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) experience reduced pain assessment and treatment, less comprehensive physical exams, and fewer explanations of the next steps in care. These disparities persist in hospitals with staffed professional interpreters, raising questions about interpreter access and the impact on outcomes. A retrospective review of 1133 trauma activations at a single center Level 1 Trauma Center in 2021–2022 was conducted. Demographic, injury, and outcome data were drawn from the institutional trauma registry, and patient-preferred language was pulled from EMR data. Early interpreter use was defined as documentation of professional interpreter use within 24 h of arrival. LOS and ICU LOS were compared between language groups using Cox regression, and mortality was compared using Fischer's exact test. 1114 patients had data available on initial injury severity and preferred language. Of the 70 LEP patients, 62 (88.6 %) required an interpreter, and 41 of those (66.1 %) had evidence of professional interpreter use within 24 h of arrival. LEP patients who lacked early interpreter use had longer hospital stays than both English proficient (EP) patients (HR 0.59,  Despite U.S. law requiring interpreters in healthcare, they are not always made available. Trauma patients without interpreter access have longer hospital stays. With interpreter access, length of stay is equivalent to that of English-speaking patients.","Over the last several years, language barriers have garnered increasing attention as determinants of care quality and outcomes in hospitalized patients. Previous studies have shown that patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) experience improved care quality and outcomes with the use of professional interpreters [ Despite the documented positive association between professional interpretation and outcomes, many studies continue to document a lack of use of interpreters and numerous disparities in care for LEP patients with traumatic injuries. LEP patients have been found to experience fewer pain assessments and treatment [ The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of interpreter utilization on LEP patient trauma outcomes. Our primary analysis examined the relationship between LEP and hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and mortality. Our secondary analysis evaluated whether provision of a professional interpreter to LEP patients within the first 24 h of trauma presentation to the hospital impacted mortality, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS. We hypothesized that LEP trauma patients who presented to the hospital and accessed a professional interpreter in the first 24 h would have reduced mortality rates, LOS, and ICU LOS in comparison to LEP patients who did not. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients at a single Level 1 Trauma Center in a mid-sized city in the southern United States following one or more traumatic injuries within 14 days of initial hospital encounters between 2021 and 2022. The study size of 1133 patients includes all trauma patients in 2021 and 2022. Chart review was performed from October 2023 through January 2024. Patients were selected using the National Trauma Data Standard and ICD-10-CM codes, which standardize data considering injury of external causes [ All notes with a time of service within 24 h of arrival were reviewed for evidence of interpreter use. “Early interpreter use” was defined as the documented use of a certified interpreter, either in-person or via virtual interpreter services, within 24 h. If the patient was unresponsive on arrival and did not regain consciousness within the first 24 h, “early interpreter use” was defined as the documented use of a certified interpreter to communicate with friends or family members. “No early interpreter use” was defined as no documentation of certified interpreter use to communicate with the patient, or family and friends if the patient was unconscious, within 24 h. If only a family member, friend, or uncertified staff member was used, this was considered “no early interpreter use.” Morbidity outcomes included ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay. Mortality was analyzed using death during hospitalization. Each patient was followed through discharge (mean 4 days). Three “language access” groups were created for comparison: English proficient (EP) patients, limited English proficiency (LEP) patients with early interpreter use, and LEP patients with no early interpreter use. Nineteen patients with incomplete outcome data and eight patients who had languages other than English listed in their chart but were recorded as requiring “no interpreter” in the demographic section were excluded from the analysis, as shown in  Inclusion criteria and study groups. Cox regressions were used to compare hospital and ICU LOS between groups. GCS on arrival and patient age were included as covariates; the model was stratified on ISS in order to meet the proportional hazards condition. These variables were selected to control for any differences in baseline clinical status between groups. Mortality analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test. In accordance with 45 CFR 46.104(d), this study is exempt from Human Research Subject Regulations. The IRB has also approved the request for a Waiver of HIPAA Authorization, after determining that the waiver of authorization satisfies the criteria set forth in the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2).

There were a total of 1133 trauma activations among patients ages 18–64 leading to admission at our Level 1 trauma center in 2021 and 2022. 1114 of these patients had available data on key information related to initial injury severity and preferred language. 70 patients (6.3 %) spoke a language other than English; 63 (5.7 %) were Spanish speakers. Of these, 62 (88.6 %) required an interpreter and were thus classified as “limited English proficiency,” and 41 (66.1 %) had documented evidence of professional interpreter use within 24 h of arrival ( Cohort demographics (sex, language, age). The cohort was majority male (n = 806, 72.4 %). The average age was 39.4 years (std dev 14.4 years). 555 (49.8 %) patients were White and 463 (49.8 %) of patients were Black. 88 patients were documented as “Other Race”; of these, it is notable that all 69 patients of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity were documented to be “Other Race” ( As documented in  Cohort injury characteristics.

Given that limited English proficiency has been associated with disparities in care [ The demographic breakdown of our study cohort aligned with several previous studies [ The most common mechanism of injury (MOI) for our cohort was motor vehicle collisions, followed by falls and gunshot wounds. A small percentage were work-related. One previous study found that LEP patients had a greater percentage of work-related injuries compared to EP patients [ While EP patients and LEP patients with early interpreter access had the same length of stay (median ratio 1), LEP patients without early interpreter access had a longer length of stay (median ratio 2.13,  We evaluated a limited number of outcome variables: length of stay, ICU length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. It is possible that analysis of other common trauma outcomes (readmission, mortality at one year, discharge to acute rehabilitation facility, disability at discharge, disability at one year) may reveal disparities not evident in this study. Because the primary competing risk, death, occurred relatively rarely (2.6 %) in our population, it is unlikely that we overestimated the hazard ratio of discharge in the LEP without interpreter population via use of the Cox model over the Fine-Gray model. However, because the mortality rate was higher (10 % vs. 2.5 %) in this population, correction of theoretical overestimation would simply decrease the HR further, revealing an even more significant disparity. This study was performed as a retrospective chart review, only limited information on both predictor and outcome variables was available. Information on preferred language and interpreter requirement was gathered through the demographic section of the electronic medical record, which is typically filled out by administrative or healthcare personnel and may not reflect true patient preference. Furthermore, there is no way to ensure that all use of professional interpreters is recorded in the patient chart. As such, it is possible that some patients classified in our study as “no interpreter access” in fact accessed utilized interpretation services without any documentation in the chart. There is also no way to determine the quality of patient interactions with interpreters. The presence of an interpreter does not ensure patient comprehension or positive interactions. This study clearly demonstrates that LEP patients with access to professional interpreters early in their trauma hospitalization do not experience the same disparities as their counterparts without interpretation access. LEP patients are at higher risk for inadequate physical exams [ As studies of interpretation services in trauma have thus far examined single-center, retrospective data, further investigations are required to increase the generalizability of findings. While a randomized control trial would shine light on the impact of interpreter use in trauma activation outcomes, withholding interpreter services from a control group is outside the scope of ethical practice. Meta-analysis of existing data or multi-center retrospective studies, however, could prove useful in augmenting the literature. Additional directions for future research should include evaluation of the quality of interactions between professional interpreters and LEP trauma patients. Investigation of communication and structural barriers experienced by interpreters and front-line providers working with LEP patients in critical condition would be insightful, as would evaluation of whether communication perceived as empathetic and effective results in different outcomes. Only two-thirds of patients with LEP were documented as utilizing interpreter services early in their hospital stay, evidence that future research is required to improve implementation of interpreters within the trauma workflow. The current literature is limited regarding solutions to consistent interpreter implementation in critical care environments. A single pediatric emergency department study found that providers will more often use professional interpreters when a video format is offered as opposed to telephone only [ In accordance with 45 CFR 46.104(d), this study is exempt from Human Research Subject Regulations.

11470406,From science to society: Exploring the nexus between obesity research and public awareness in Brazil,"Raising public awareness about the medical aspects of obesity is crucial in Brazil, given its escalating prevalence. This study investigated the correlation between scientific research on obesity in the country and public awareness by scrutinizing scientific publications and online search trends. Scientific data were sourced from Dimensions, while online engagement data were extracted from Google Trends. Key metrics were analyzed, including scientific publication trends, Altmetrics, news image trends, YouTube trends, and web search trends. Linear regression and the Mann-Kendall test assessed trends, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) explored dataset variations. Scientific publications on obesity in Brazil consistently increased from 2004 to 2023, reflecting growing scientific interest. The number of publications increased from 300 in 2004 to 7566 in 2022, representing a 25-fold increase. However, web search trends among the general population declined by 79 % during the same period, indicating ineffective ""knowledge translation”. Altmetrics and news image trends fluctuated, while YouTube trends exhibited a decline. The disparity between scientific publications and public web search trends highlights the necessity for more efficient scientific information communication. The gap between scientific publishing and public web search trends highlights the need for improved scientific communication. Measures such as formal science communication training for scientists, leveraging social media, embracing arts-based approaches, and nurse advocacy can facilitate informed public discourse and foster interest in obesity-related topics.","Obesity is a global health crisis affecting millions of people worldwide. According to a recent systematic Global Burden of Disease Study analysis, the age-standardized global DALY rates attributable to high body-mass index (BMI) rose by 15.7 % (9.9–21.7) between 2000 and 2021 [ Public awareness of obesity in Brazil is an essential health and public policy issue. The country is in the early stages of addressing obesity, and more efforts are needed to curb the progression of the disease [ Contributors to the high rate of obesity in Brazil include contextual and socio-economic factors, lifestyle choices, and demographic characteristics such as demographic density, employment rates, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, income inequality (Gini coefficient), urbanization rate, level of education, and income status [ Obesity in Brazil has significant social and economic consequences. At the individual level, obesity is associated with reduced life expectancy, lower productivity and wages, increased healthcare expenditure, and private expenditures on preventative measures [ Factors contributing to the public awareness of obesity in Brazil include the shifts in dietary consumption and energy expenditure influenced by economic, demographic, and epidemiological changes at a population level [ Strategies for dealing with obesity in Brazil involve both the healthcare system and the food and nutritional security system, emphasizing the need for integrated and intersectoral approaches [ New technologies and data sources in the digital age offer unique possibilities to study social trends and public interest in health issues. Platforms like Google Trends provide real-time data on search behaviors, allowing researchers to monitor and examine public interest in ways that traditional survey methods cannot. For example, Bayram and Ozturkcan used Google Trends data from 2004 to 2022 to identify public interest trends in weight loss, physical activity, diet, nutrition, healthy diet, healthy nutrition, optimum nutrition, healthy food, and a combination of weight loss and diet-related topics in Europe. Comprehensive research information databases like Dimensions [ This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the scientific interest in obesity and the public discussions and level of awareness of this condition. Thus, we aimed to understand the interplay between scientific knowledge dissemination and public awareness in the context of obesity in Brazil. To investigate the relationship between scientific research on obesity in Brazil, public awareness, and online engagement, we employed the SPIDER framework [ We conducted a comprehensive data collection process utilizing two distinct sources: Primary key metrics included: Scientific publication trends and Web search trends among the public. 
 Scientific metrics: Citations: Total publication citations are the number of times that other publications in the database have cited a publication. Median number of citations per publication published in each year. Grants: number of grants active and the number of grants started in each year. Clinical trials: number of clinical trials active and the number of clinical trials started in each year Public interest metrics: Publications with attention: the percentage of publications with Altmetric attention. Altmetric Attention Score: The mean Altmetric Attention Score is a weighted count of all the online “attention” Altmetric has discovered for an individual research output. This includes mentions in public policy documents as well as references in Wikipedia, mainstream news, social networks, blogs, and other places. Web news search (analytics only available starting 2008): Tracked the search popularity of the term ""obesidade"" in the Brazilian news articles over time to see which obesity stories are resonating with the public. Web image search (analytics only available starting 2008): Tracked the search popularity of images related to obesity over time to see how people in Brazil are visually engaging with the topic of obesity. YouTube search (analytics only available starting 2008): Tracked the search popularity in Brazil of videos about obesity over time. To explore potential correlations between trends in research output metrics related to obesity in Brazil and corresponding metrics of online engagement, we conducted the following statistical analyses: Linear regression analysis - to quantify trends in the popularity metrics over time. For each metric, a linear trend line was fitted to the data, and the slope of this trend line was calculated. The significance of each slope was assessed to determine whether it differed significantly from zero, indicating a non-zero trend. DFn (Degrees of Freedom numerator) and DFd (Degrees of Freedom denominator) were used to represent degrees of freedom, which are critical for calculating F-statistic and p-value and determining critical values for hypothesis testing. Mann-Kendall test – to detect monotonic trends in time series data. It assessed the presence of trends and determined their direction, whether positive (increasing), negative (decreasing), or stable (no significant trend). Before analyses, we assessed the normality of the data distribution using the D'Agostino & Pearson test. Analysis of scientific publication trends from 2004 to 2023 revealed a notable and consistent increase in the number of research articles related to obesity in Brazil ( In the simple linear regression analysis of scientific publications (total), a significant positive linear relationship was observed, with a slope of 413.3 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 344.2 to 482.3, p < 0.0001). Conversely, the Web Search Trends data revealed a significant negative linear relationship, with a slope of −3.340 (95 % CI: 4.654 to −2.027, p < 0.0001). These findings indicate that ""Publications (total)"" and ""Web Search Trends"" are moving in opposite directions and differ in terms of linearity. In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the first principal component (PC1) was significantly influenced by both ""Publications (total)"" and ""Web Search Trends."" The eigenvector for ""Publications (total)"" was 0.7071, indicating a strong positive contribution to PC1. This suggests that as the number of total publications increases, so does the value of PC1. Conversely, ""Web Search Trends"" had an eigenvector of −0.7071, demonstrating a strong negative contribution to PC1. This implies an inverse relationship, where an increase in web search trends corresponds to a decrease in PC1. The equal but opposite eigenvectors for these two variables highlight a notable negative correlation within the context of PC1. The search of the Dimensions research information database yielded 74,304 papers, 203 clinical trials, and 795 grants ( The leading research organizations in terms of obesity-related publications include Universidade de São Paulo (USP) with 15,954 publications to date, Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) with 6045 publications, and State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) with 5468 publications ( The primary funders contributing to obesity-related publications are the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) with 16,891 publications to date, the Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) with 13,866 publications, and the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) with 8659 publications ( In terms of funding grants related to obesity research, the most prominent organizations are the Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) with 427 funded grants to date, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) with 182 funded grants, and the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) with 177 funded grants ( Analysis of key metrics demonstrated distinct trends in scientific and public interest in obesity in Brazil ( Mann-Kendall trend, linear regression slope analysis, and eigenvectors of variables on the First Principal Component (PC1). Coef.Var. = coefficient of variation; Std. Error Slope = Standard Error Slope; DFn = Degrees of Freedom numerator; DFd = Degrees of Freedom denominator. However, general public interest in obesity in Brazil, as represented by Online Image Trends, Web Search Trends, and YouTube trends ( In the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), eigenvectors for the first principal component (PC1) were calculated ( The analysis of obesity interest in Brazil using Google Trends showed a decline over the investigated period, with variations observed across geographic regions in Brazil. The figures defining interest over time represent search interest relative to the chart's peak for the given region and time (a value of 100 represents the term's peak level of popularity). The top states in Brazil where obesity was of interest were Piauí, Bahia, and Amapá ( The analysis of scientific publication trends from 2004 to 2023 revealed a noteworthy and consistent increase in the number of research articles related to obesity in Brazil. This upward trajectory reflects the growing attention of the scientific community to the issue of obesity within the country. The expansion of research in this domain signifies an intensified effort to understand, address, and mitigate the complexities associated with obesity. In contrast to the rising scientific interest, a striking decrease in web search trends related to obesity among the general public during the same time frame (2004–2023) was observed. This decrease in public web searches signifies a potential lack of efficient translation of scientific knowledge and findings to the broader population. The results of this study indicate that there is a discrepancy between scientific publications and public interest on the topic of obesity in Brazil. While there has been an increasing trend in scientific publications on obesity in Brazil, there has been a decreasing trend in web searches among the public on this topic. This disconnect suggests that there is a lack of efficiently translating the science to the public. This is a concerning finding, as it means that the public may not be aware of the latest research on obesity and its prevention and treatment, underscoring the need for more effective science communication and outreach efforts. Bridging this gap is essential to ensure that the valuable insights and advancements in obesity research reach and resonate with the public. In doing so, we could enhance public awareness, encourage informed decision-making, and facilitate meaningful interventions to combat the obesity epidemic in Brazil. The evidence indicates an increasing scholarly focus on obesity research in Brazil. The increasing trends in both total publications and citations suggest a growing body of research addressing obesity in Brazil and an increasing recognition of this work within the scientific community. The rise in grants and clinical trials further underscores the increasing allocation of resources towards this area of study. The increase in publications with attention and mean Altmetric Attention Score indicates that the general public is becoming more engaged with scientific research on obesity. However, the decrease in the median Altmetric Attention Score suggests that this increased attention may be driven by a small number of highly popular publications, while the typical publication is receiving less attention over time. The decrease in median citations indicates that while the total number of citations is increasing, the typical publication is being cited less frequently over time. This could be due to a growing body of literature on obesity, making it harder for individual publications to stand out and garner citations. Over the years, there may have been a saturation of research on obesity-related topics in Brazil. As more studies are conducted and published, it becomes increasingly challenging for individual publications to stand out and receive a high number of citations. Changes in citation behavior among researchers and journals can impact citation counts. Researchers may cite a smaller number of papers due to a focus on recent or highly influential work, which can affect the median number of citations. Additionally, it is possible that the decrease in the median number of citations per publication on obesity in Brazil is due to a specific factor related to the Brazilian research landscape. For example, it is possible that Brazilian researchers are less likely to cite each other's work, or that Brazilian researchers are more likely to publish their work in non-English journals, which are less likely to be cited by researchers from other countries. The decreasing trends in online image trends, web search trends, and Youtube trends suggest a decline in the general public's interest in obesity. This could be due to a variety of factors such as changes in public perception, competing health interests, or shifts in media coverage. The stability of online news trends suggests that news coverage of obesity has remained consistent over time. Interestingly, this decline in public interest occurred despite a significant increase in social media usage in Brazil during the study period. According to data from DataReportal – Global Digital Insights, the number of social media users increased from 96 million in 2015 (47 % of the population) to 152.4 million (71.6 % of the population) [ Recent developments in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in anti-obesity drugs, may also influence the landscape of obesity research and public awareness in Brazil. For instance, the approval of new weight-loss medications such as semaglutide (Wegovy) in 2021 has garnered significant attention globally [ While this study focuses on Brazil, it's worth considering whether similar trends are observed in countries with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Studies in different countries on the relationship between obesity research and public awareness may differ due to varying levels of health literacy, communication gaps, information overload, and public health priorities. For example, a survey on how the public in Germany understood obesity revealed that only a moderate number of people accepted the idea that it was a disease [ The observed discrepancy between the increasing scientific interest in obesity and the decreasing public interest in the topic raises important questions about the factors responsible for this gap in the translation of scientific knowledge. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon. Addressing the gap in the translation of scientific knowledge to the general population is critical for public health and effective policymaking. Some potential solutions include: This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the use of Google Trends data may introduce bias towards internet users and may not fully capture offline interest in obesity-related topics. Additionally, changes in internet access and usage patterns over the study period could influence the observed trends. Second, our analysis of scientific publications may be subject to publication bias, where positive or novel findings are more likely to be published. Third, while web searches provide valuable insights into public interest, they may not capture the full scope of public awareness. Other forms of engagement, such as participation in health programs or discussions in non-digital forums, are not reflected in this data. Lastly, the Altmetric Attention Score, while useful for gauging online engagement, has its own limitations and may not fully represent the impact or reach of scientific publications in all contexts. In conclusion, the increasing scientific interest in obesity research in Brazil, as evidenced by rising publications and citations, must be complemented by effective knowledge translation to the general population. The gap between scientific knowledge and public awareness can be addressed through improved health literacy, enhanced science communication, interactive platforms, and comprehensive public health initiatives. Closing this gap is essential for informed decision-making, public engagement, and meaningful interventions in the fight against obesity in Brazil.

11470166,Predicting Prenatal Depression and Assessing Model Bias Using Machine Learning Models,"Perinatal depression is one of the most common medical complications during pregnancy and postpartum period, affecting 10% to 20% of pregnant individuals, with higher rates among Black and Latina women who are also less likely to be diagnosed and treated. Machine learning (ML) models based on electronic medical records (EMRs) have effectively predicted postpartum depression in middle-class White women but have rarely included sufficient proportions of racial/ethnic minorities, which has contributed to biases in ML models. Our goal is to determine whether ML models could predict depression in early pregnancy in racial/ethnic minority women by leveraging EMR data. We extracted EMRs from a large U.S. urban hospital serving mostly low-income Black and Hispanic women ( Although the best-performing ML model's (elastic net) performance was low (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.61), we identified known perinatal depression risk factors such as unplanned pregnancy and being single and underexplored factors such as self-reported pain, lower prenatal vitamin intake, asthma, carrying a male fetus, and lower platelet levels. Despite the sample comprising mostly low-income minority women (54% Black, 27% Latina), the model performed worse for these communities (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 57% Black, 59% Latina women vs. 64% White women). EMR-based ML models could moderately predict early pregnancy depression but exhibited biased performance against low-income minority women. Perinatal depression affects 10% to 20% of pregnant individuals, with higher rates among racial/ethnic minorities who are underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study used machine learning models on electronic medical record data from a hospital serving mostly low-income Black and Hispanic women to predict early pregnancy depression. While the best model performed moderately well, it exhibited bias, predicting depression less accurately for Black and Latina women compared with White women. The study identified some known risk factors such as unplanned pregnancy and underexplored factors such as self-reported pain, lower prenatal vitamin intake, and carrying a male fetus that may contribute to perinatal depression. Perinatal depression affects 10% to 20% of pregnant individuals, with higher rates among racial/ethnic minorities who are underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study used machine learning models on electronic medical record data from a hospital serving mostly low-income Black and Hispanic women to predict early pregnancy depression.

The study identified some known risk factors such as unplanned pregnancy and underexplored factors such as self-reported pain, lower prenatal vitamin intake, and carrying a male fetus that may contribute to perinatal depression.","Perinatal depression (PND), depression during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum, is one of the most common complications during the perinatal period ( Multiple individual-level factors have been linked to increased PND risk, such as lack of a partner and social support ( Computational approaches, such as machine learning (ML) using electronic medical records (EMRs), have been able to predict pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes ( Biases in prediction performance exist in ML models, which refer to the disparate levels of model prediction of the outcome of interest for certain sociodemographic variables, called protected variables, such as sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status ( Despite the negative consequences of depression during pregnancy for both the mother and the infant that disproportionally affect low-income women of color, no study has thus far used EMRs enriched by women of color from underresourced communities to predict depression early in pregnancy and examined the model bias. Here, we constructed ML models to predict depression symptom severity early in pregnancy for urban low-income women of color who received care in the same outpatient obstetric clinic, and we subsequently assessed model performance and racial and ethnic biases. EMRs were extracted from patients who received obstetric care at the University of Illinois Chicago Hospital Health Sciences System, an urban academic hospital in Chicago, where the population served is 52% non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 29% Hispanic (H), 9% NHW, and 10% Asian and Native American, and we further selected EMRs from patients who were 15 years or older and received their obstetric care and delivered at University of Illinois Chicago between 2014 and 2020. We obtained information on the patient’s sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, mental health assessments, health behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, vital records, laboratory tests, medications, prior and current obstetric complications, and delivery and fetus information) ( Patients were included if 1) their PHQ-9 scores were between 1 and 4 or 9 and above and 2) their first obstetric visit was before 24 gestational weeks given that depressive symptoms later in pregnancy might be distinct from those in early pregnancy. We excluded patients with mild levels of depression (PHQ-9 scores between 5 and 8) or those who reported no depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score 0) to avoid incorporating possible false negatives due to underreported or denial of symptoms, respectively. Patients with a PHQ-9 score > 9 were categorized as cases, and those with a PHQ-9 score between 1 and 4 as controls ( EMR features recorded after the first perinatal appointment were excluded from downstream analysis (e.g., gestational diabetes or preeclampsia diagnosis), as well as features that were missing in more than 60% of patients ( We explored different ML models, including random forest, elastic net, and XGBoost, to identify the most suitable ones for predicting PND. We evaluated and selected models based on their accuracy, AUROC, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, specificity, and model bias. We also computed the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1) and the area under the precision-recall curve. Model sensitivity was fixed at 85% for all models to maximize the identification of true depression cases ( We employed a nested  To identify the importance and directionality with respect to depressive symptom severity of the EMR features, we calculated the Shapley values using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) ( RR of a single feature  The Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables to identify differences among independent groups. Distinctions between models were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A two proportion  We employed 4 common metrics to assess model bias: the disparate impact (DI) ( The privileged group was selected as the racial/ethnic group with the highest AUROC. In our study, the privileged group was NHW women, and the unprivileged groups were NHB and Latina women. The calibration curve ( The extracted data included 5875 pregnant women and 694 EMR features ( Overall workflow. Electronic medical records were extracted from 5875 patients ages 15 years or older who received obstetric care and delivered at University of Illinois (UI) Health between 2014 and 2020. Patients were included based on their Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores and timing of their first obstetric visit, before 24 weeks. The preprocessed electronic medical record data underwent normalization and nested  Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Sample Used for Model Optimization Values are presented as  BMI, body mass index; H, Hispanic or Latina; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; NHW, non-Hispanic White; PHQ, Patient Health Questionnaire. First, we determined the most adequate ML model to predict depressive symptom severity early in pregnancy in our sample, including random forest ( To identify the features that were most predictive of depressive symptom severity early in pregnancy and the directionality of their associations, we determined their Shapley values. Based on game theory, Shapley values provide an estimate of the contribution made by each feature toward the overall prediction of the model. The top 20 most predictive features based on their mean absolute Shapley values included well-known sociodemographic factors associated with PND, such as having an unplanned pregnancy ( Multiple known and unexplored electronic medical record features were associated with perinatal depression (PND) status.  Inspection of the contribution of top significant features to PND across patient’s race/ethnicity ( Next, we determined the RR associated with the most predictive features of depressive symptom severity based on their Shapley value ( The predicted relative risk of top selected features.  Finally, we examined whether ML models had the same predictive capability to predict PND without including the individual’s race/ethnicity in the feature set for model training ( Electronic medical record–based machine learning models are biased against low-income minority women.  To further estimate the inequality of model prediction or model bias, we calculated 4 common bias metrics: EOD—the true positive difference between the privileged and unprivileged group; DI—the ratio of positive predictions between the privileged and unprivileged groups; and EO/standard deviation of TPR and FPR across race/ethnicity. Removal of race/ethnicity training features from the models—specifically, when comparing Model 1 with Model 2—moderately reduced model performance disparities as measured by DI, EOD, EO (TPR), and EO (FPR), with more significant improvements for NHB women (adjusted  In this study, we examined the capability of interpretable ML models to predict the risk of depression during early pregnancy in low-income women of color using EMRs, demonstrating that EMR-based ML models were moderately predictive of depressive symptom severity in early pregnancy in this high-risk population. In addition, using the SHAP analysis, we identified factors associated with the risk of early PND including the directionality of their associations. Our models not only revealed well-known factors, such as unplanned pregnancy, history of medication use to treat mood disorders, or young age, but also captured novel or underexplored markers, such as self-reported pain levels, asthma diagnosis, carrying a male fetus, or systemic platelet volume. Importantly, our results highlighted the significant performance disparity in model prediction among racial/ethnic groups, with women of color at greater disadvantages in model predictions. ML models to predict PND in racial and ethnic minorities are scarce. EMR-based ML models to predict postpartum depression have been developed in a wide variety of populations [e.g., Chinese ( Our results are interpretable, a very important capability to identify markers that providers can intervene upon. Using SHAP analysis, we revealed several established markers that increased the risk of depression in early pregnancy, such as unplanned pregnancy ( Importantly, our analysis uncovered several new or underexplored markers that increased the predicted risk of depression during early pregnancy, such as self-reported pain levels, mean platelet volume in blood ( Despite our original expectation, employing samples enriched in individuals from underserved populations did not mitigate EMR-based ML model’s performance bias. Our results revealed a significant disparity in model performance among race/ethnicity groups to predict PND. NHW women, the least represented group in the sample, were predicted significantly better than NHB women, who represented more than 54% of the sample. This contradicts prior studies and suggests that even with a majority of data from underprivileged groups with similar EMR quality, ML models can indeed exhibit performance bias. Multiple reasons might explain our observed results. For instance, due to cultural differences, social stigma, or medical mistrust, NHB women might underreport their symptoms more often than NHW women. Studies indicate that urban low-income women of color report lower levels of depressive symptoms than NHW women using self-reported questionnaires despite having the same diagnosis when assessed by a clinical provider ( Another possibility is that EMRs might not contain all the necessary information to predict PND. For example, certain neighborhood characteristics, such as violence rate, living in poverty areas, or levels of air pollution, are known to increase chronic stress and, consequently, chronic inflammation ( Our study has several strengths, including 1) the exploration of the predictive capabilities of ML models using EMR to identify depression early in pregnancy in low-income women of color, given that most of the current studies aimed to predict postpartum depression in middle-class NHW women; 2) the use of SHAP analysis to make model results interpretable and thus actionable; and 3) assessing model biases. Given that the current study has not been externally validated through other datasets, our models should be confirmed in other populations with larger sample sizes, including other groups that are at high risk of PND (e.g., housing instability) using clinical diagnoses of PND, such as ICD-9/10 codes, instead of self-report depression questionnaires. Interpretable ML models based on available EMRs can aid in identifying women at high risk of PND in their early pregnancy. This will enable providers to intervene proactively early enough to prevent the negative consequences of PND for both the mother and the child, such as prescribing appropriate medications, recommending therapy, or providing guidance on preventive measures. However, new tools and approaches are necessary to increase the prediction performance of EMR-based ML models to reduce model biases so that the risk of PND can be equitably predicted for all pregnant individuals.","['Electronic medical records', 'Health disparities', 'Machine learning', 'Model performance bias', 'Perinatal depression']",2024-8-14,Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science,STD
11470126,Tandem mobilization of anti-phage defenses alongside SCC,"Recent research has identified multiple immune systems that bacteria use to protect themselves from viral infections. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these systems horizontally spread, especially among bacterial pathogens. Here, we investigate antiviral defenses in staphylococci, opportunistic pathogens that constitute leading causes of antibiotic-resistant infections. We show that these organisms harbor a variety of anti-phage defenses encoded within or near SCC (staphylococcal cassette chromosome)  Recent research has identified multiple immune systems that bacteria use to protect themselves from viral infections.

11469891,Risk of Postoperative Complications After Total Hip and Total Knee Arthroplasty in Behcet Syndrome Patients,"Behcet syndrome (BS), a multisystem autoimmune disorder, has unclear effects on outcomes after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study assessed the relative risk of perioperative adverse events in patients with BS. This retrospective cohort study used the PearlDiver M157Ortho data set, a large national administrative database. Total hip arthroplasty and TKA patients with BS were identified and matched 1:4 to those without BS based on patient age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores, and procedure performed (THA or TKA). The incidence of 90-day adverse events was determined and compared by multivariate analysis. 5-year survival to revision surgeries was assessed and compared with the log-rank test. After matching, 282 THA/TKA patients with BS were identified and compared with 1127 without BS. On multivariate analysis, patients with BS were at independently greater risk of aggregated any (odds ratio [OR] 2.16,  Patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA experienced markedly greater 90-day postoperative adverse events. The findings underscore the need for optimized perioperative management for patients with BS undergoing arthroplasty.","Total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are frequently performed orthopaedic procedures to alleviate pain and restore function in patients with end-stage osteoarthritis and other joint disorders. Behcet syndrome (BS) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that is associated with immune dysregulation, cardiopulmonary issues, and vascular dysfunction. Multiple studies have explored the risk factors of adverse events after orthopaedic surgeries, with factors such as age, comorbidity burden, and specific conditions like diabetes mellitus being associated with increased risks. Behcet syndrome, although less common than RA, presents a similar challenge in the orthopaedic setting, given the disease's multisystem involvement and the potential side effects of treatments. Thus, using the PearlDiver M157Ortho data set, this study aimed to evaluate the relative risk of 90-day adverse events and 5-year survival to revision surgery in patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA compared with those without BS. This work builds on the growing trend of leveraging large national databases to evaluate nuanced patient populations, providing insights that may not be attainable through localized studies. This study used the 2010-2022 PearlDiver M157Ortho data set (Colorado Springs, Colorado). This is a large Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act report national billing claims data set containing information on over 157 million orthopaedic patients in the United States across all payer types and sites of care. All PearlDiver data are output deidentified and aggregated at the user interface level; thus, our institutional review board deemed studies using this database exempt from review. Current Procedural Terminology codes 27447 and 27130 were used to identify patients who underwent primary TKA or primary THA, respectively. Patients who had any diagnosis related to trauma, neoplasm, or infection on the day of surgery were excluded from the study cohort. International Classifications of Disease codes were used to isolate TKA and THA patients with and without Behcet syndrome (BS). Several patient demographics were abstracted, including age, sex, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI, a longitudinal measure of patient comorbidity burden generated using International Classifications of Disease codes). TKA/THA patients with and without BS were subsequently matched in a 1:4 ratio based on age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed (TKA or THA) using the PearlDiver system. 90-day postoperative adverse events were identified based on International Classifications of Disease codes, as previously described. 5-year revision surgery rates were then defined based on the occurrence of revision codes after index TKA/THA procedures. Survival to revision surgery was determined for matched cohorts of TKA/THA patients with Behcet and without Behcet and compared between the 2 groups. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare demographics of arthroplasty patients with and without BS both before and after matching. The Welch  A multivariate logistic regression model controlling for patient age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed (TKA or THA) was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals of experiencing adverse events in the 90 days after arthroplasty surgery in the matched cohort of patients with BS compared with those without BS. 5-year survival to revision surgery was compared between matched cohorts of arthroplasty patients with and without BS using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Log-rank analysis was conducted to evaluate for a statistically significant difference in 5-year survival between the 2 cohorts. All statistical analyses were conducted using the in-built PearlDiver system. Statistical significance was designated as  A total of 2,119,069 arthroplasty patients were identified in the data set from 2010 to 2021, of which 1,437,208 (67.8%) underwent TKA and 681,579 (32.2%) underwent THA. Of this group, 282 patients (0.013%) had a diagnosis of BS, among which 171 (60.6%) underwent TKA and 111 (39.4%) underwent THA (Table  Univariate Analysis of Unmatched and Matched Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Patients With and Without Behcet Syndrome THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty, ECI = Elixhauser Comorbidity Index Bold entries represent statistically significant  After matching arthroplasty patients with and without BS 1:4 based on age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed, 1127 patients (80.0%) without BS were identified and compared with 282 (20.0%) with BS.

The incidence of any, serious, minor, and individual adverse events among matched arthroplasty patients with and without BS is listed in Table  Univariate Incidence of Adverse Events After THA/TKA in Matched Patients With and Without Behcet Syndrome THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty Bold entries represent statistically significant  The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for patient age, sex, ECI, and procedure performed (TKA or THA) are presented in Table  Multivariate Analysis of Risk of Adverse Events After TKA/THA in Patients With Behcet Versus Those Without Behcet THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty Bold entries represent statistically significant  Plot demonstrating risk of adverse events after arthroplasty surgery (THA/TKA) in patients with Behcet syndrome versus those without BS.

THA = total hip arthroplasty, TKA = total knee arthroplasty Post hoc power analysis revealed the average power for the study to be 0.556, suggesting moderate overall ability of this study to detect differences in adverse events between TKA/THA patients with and without BS. At present, there is a scarcity of clinical research examining surgical outcomes in patients with BS undergoing THA or TKA. Existing studies include a single case report demonstrating a patient with BS who experienced massive pulmonary embolism after THA In our extensive study involving a large cohort of over 2 million patients undergoing THA and TKA, we observed that a small fraction had BS, representing just 0.013% of the study population. This incidence rate is in line with previously reported incidence rates of BS in the United States, ranging from 0.005% to 0.011%. Once the populations were matched and variables controlled for, there were differences in perioperative outcomes for those with versus without BS. Of the adverse outcomes analyzed, BS patients had greatest increased odds of experiencing postoperative pneumonia. This aligned with known irreversible parenchymal lung damage associated with patients with BS that predisposes them to pneumonia. The increased odds for UTI for those with BS may align with genital ulcers that are a well-documented complication of BS. Pulmonary embolism was the other individual perioperative adverse outcome associated with BS. There already exists a body of literature highlighting the pulmonary vascular disease as a clinical feature of BS. This study revealed no difference in the rate of revision surgery within a 5-year period after THA or TKA, indicating that while patients with BS carry a markedly higher risk of short-term complications, their risk on long-term issues are similar to those without the condition. Notably, the complications seen in this population seem to be largely medical rather than surgical. This is encouraging that after mitigation of short-term complications, longer term implant survival may not be affected. This study has several limitations. Notably, administrative data are limited based on the accuracy of coding. Additional administrative data do not provide patient-reported, surgeon-reported, or radiographic outcome measures; thus, these clinically relevant measures are unavailable in this study. In addition, medical therapies administered during the perioperative period including immunosuppression or anticoagulation were not controlled for in the analysis. Finally, surgical approach, hip-specific outcome measures, and adverse surgical outcomes were not assessed. In conclusion, patients with BS undergoing TKA/THA have increased risk of postoperative complications including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and UTI. Increased care must be taken during the perioperative period to mitigate these risks. Specifically, given the greater risk of pulmonary embolism, patients with BS undergoing TKA/THA may be considered for stronger venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Furthermore, given the greater risk of infection in patients with BS, notably sepsis, pneumonia, and UTI, likely due to immunosuppressive medications used to treat the disease, holding these medications in the perioperative period could be considered. In addition, close postoperative monitoring is required in this group to detect early signs of infection. Ultimately, while there is an increased risk of postoperative complications, the longer term similar revision rates should be encouraging to those with this condition and those caring for them.",[],2024-10-10,JAAOS Global Research & Reviews,STD

11469041,Nanofiber Topographies Enhance Platelet‐Fibrinogen Scaffold Interactions,"The initial contact with blood and its components, including plasma proteins and platelets, directs the body's response to foreign materials. Natural scaffolds of extracellular matrix or fibrin contain fibrils with nanoscale dimensions, but how platelets specifically respond to the topography and architecture of fibrous materials is still incompletely understood. Here, planar and nanofiber scaffolds are fabricated from native fibrinogen to characterize the morphology of adherent platelets and activation markers for phosphatidylserine exposure and  Fibrinogen is a natural component of blood clots and a candidate material for wound dressings. Here, fibrinogen coatings of different topography are demonstrated to activate platelets to different degrees. It is uncovered that the increased surface area of 3D fibrinogen nanofibers favors platelet noncoagulant responses, while plasma components render the scaffolds less adhesive. Topography thus steers blood‐material interactions and platelet responses.
","The treatment of acute and chronic wounds has evolved into one of the greatest challenges of our rapidly aging population. When a blood vessel gets injured, platelets (i.e., thrombocytes) adhere to the subendothelial matrix and form a thrombus through fibrinogen‐mediated platelet‐platelet aggregation. So far, the role of surface topography on platelet‐material interactions has been investigated predominantly in the context of dental implants. Microtextured titanium disks with rough surfaces led to enhanced platelet adhesion from platelet rich plasma (PRP) Fibrin gels can be readily fabricated from (autologous) plasma or from purified fibrinogen by the addition of thrombin and calcium. While fibrin gels offer a simple route to 3D nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, We first characterized the surface topography of nanofibrous versus planar fibrinogen scaffolds. As a reference to facilitate comparisons with previous platelet studies, we included coverslips that were coated with fibrinogen by physisorption from solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and confocal microscopy images showed flat, almost featureless surfaces for the physisorbed glass and planar scaffolds, with an increased fibrinogen staining density on planar scaffolds ( Interactions of human platelet‐rich plasma (PRP) with fibrinogen scaffolds of different topographies.

For (e,f), differences between topographies were assessed by a ratio paired  We next investigated how different aspects of the nanofiber topography contributed to platelet responses. We first assessed whether the micrometer‐scale substrate curvature affected platelet adhesion and spreading. Platelets on nanofibers were found to spread in both, convex regions (“peaks”) or in concave regions (“valleys”) of the undulated 3D landscape ( Influence of scaffold curvature and locally accessible surface area on platelet interactions. a) Representative confocal slices of single platelets on nanofiber scaffolds.

Data analysis was based on high‐resolution deconvolved confocal  Apart from forming a mountainous landscape on the micrometer scale, fibrinogen nanofibers offer a substantially increased surface area due to their thin diameter and porous network architecture (cf. Figure  Based on this analysis, we hypothesized that an increased locally accessible surface area due to the mountainous 3D topography directly modulated platelet spreading by offering more immobilized fibrinogen molecules that can be bound by platelet integrins. To test our hypothesis in a more generic setting, we turned toward PDMS micropost arrays as a geometrically well‐defined 3D topography model. We compared two cases: arrays in which only the tops of posts were microcontact‐printed with fibrinogen while the surfaces between posts were passivated, restricting platelet adhesion and spreading to the printed post tops, versus arrays that were uniformly coated with fibrinogen by physisorption, allowing platelets to adhere on posts or in the gaps between posts (Figure  It is well established that the activation threshold of platelets in solution depends on plasma components, Modulation of platelet adhesion on fibrinogen scaffolds by plasma components. a–f) Representative confocal images of a) PRP on untreated scaffolds or b–f) washed platelets on scaffolds preincubated with b) platelet‐poor plasma (PPP), c) bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg mL To test whether the reduction in platelet adhesion was due to a blocking effect, we preincubated the scaffolds with albumin, a major component of plasma commonly used to reduce unspecific protein adsorption or cell adhesion to artificial surfaces. Washed platelets spread normally on albumin‐blocked planar and nanofibrous scaffolds (Figure  The thrombogenicity of materials often is an indirect effect mediated by activation of coagulation, Many blood‐biomaterial interactions take place under shear flow which is known to affect platelet‐surface interactions through adhesion receptor mechanotransduction.

Platelets were visualized by the fluorescent DiOC6 membrane stain in epifluorescence at two frames per second. a) End frame (left, inverted colormap) and kymographs (right) of time‐lapse acquisitions at shear rates of 1500 s The two major findings of our study are that a 3D nanofiber topography facilitates platelet interactions with fibrinogen scaffolds by increasing the local surface area (Figures  Different platelet activation outcomes, most importantly proadhesive integrin activation (enabling attachment at wound sites and platelet aggregation), procoagulant PS exposure (contributing to thrombin‐driven coagulation), as well as prohemostatic and proangiogenic  Immobilized fibrinogen is a well‐known activating stimulus that induces platelet spreading. The interaction of plasma components with the fibrinogen scaffolds that happened before platelet adhesion, rather than their direct action on platelets, led to reduced platelet‐scaffold interactions (Figure  Altogether, our study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of employing self‐assembled biomimetic nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds to enhance platelet adhesion and spreading as compared to planar fibrinogen surfaces. Further studies are required to elucidate the interactions of plasma proteins with these scaffolds and their capacity to modulate platelet‐scaffold interactions. It is expected that these differential blood‐scaffold interactions based on topography also change the interactions of other cells with the material. This opens up the opportunity to employ fibrinogen scaffolds with defined topography‐function relationships for various tissue engineering applications, e.g., as novel wound dressing materials or implant coatings. Toward future applications in wound healing where platelets are known to recruit and instruct immune cells, it will be critical to assess the interactions of immune cells with nanostructured fibrinogen scaffolds, ideally taking PRP exposure into account. Targeted modulation of platelet responses by topography may have potential to enhance responses in patients who suffer from impaired wound healing. Other avenues for fibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are the cocultivation of skin cells to develop new biomaterials for skin tissue engineering or the tailoring of the topography of fibrinogen‐based biomaterials for stem cell differentiation or blood vessel replacement. Our more general finding that surface topography on the nanometer to micrometer scale differentially affected certain platelet activation pathways suggests that topography could be exploited as a design parameter for new biomaterials to prevent excessive clotting while supporting the physiological function of platelets. In this respect, we speculate that (nano)topography might be usable as an alternative to heparin coatings of implants. Generally, the comprehensive methodology used in this study could be applied to delineate the particular contributions of plasma proteins and platelets to define blood‐material interactions also for other (bio)materials. Improved understanding of how the interactions of plasma and/or PRP with tissue engineered scaffolds, either by design Glass slides coated with (3‐aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) were used as substrate to prepare nanofibrous and planar fibrinogen scaffolds following a previously published routine. As previously introduced, Micropost arrays containing micropillars of 2.65 µm in height and 1 µm in diameter arranged in hexagonal arrays between solid supports were prepared as previously described.

11468921,Primitive asteroids as a major source of terrestrial volatiles,"The origins of Earth’s volatiles are debated. Recent studies showed that meteorites display unique mass-independent isotopic signatures of the volatile element Zn, suggesting that Earth’s Zn originated from materials derived from different regions of the Solar System. However, these studies largely omitted meteorites from the differentiated planetesimals thought to represent the Earth’s building blocks, which underwent melting and substantial volatile loss. Here, we characterize the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites from such planetesimals. We incorporate these results in mixing models that aim to reproduce Earth’s abundance and isotope compositions of Zn and other elements. Our results suggest that, while differentiated planetesimals supplied ~70% of Earth’s mass, they provided only ~10% of its Zn. The remaining Zn was supplied by primitive materials that did not experience melting and associated volatile loss. Combined with other findings, our results imply that an unmelted primitive material is likely required to establish the volatile budgets of the terrestrial planets. Primitive unmelted material supplied nearly 90% of Earth’s zinc and likely other volatiles.","Despite an expanding search in the Solar System and other parts of our galaxy, life remains undetected outside of our planet. With the advancement of observational technology and a seemingly infinite pool of potentially habitable exoplanets, determining the events that led to the habitable conditions on Earth becomes increasingly more important. Yet, both the nature of Earth’s accreting materials and the manner in which they coalesced are still debated. A common approach to address the origin of the materials from which our planet formed is to use nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies to fingerprint the Earth’s building blocks among diverse Solar System materials. These small but detectable differences (mass-independent “anomalies”) in isotope compositions result from the heterogeneous distribution of isotopically distinct grains through the cloud of gas and dust from which all Solar System bodies formed. An important advantage of this approach is that these anomalies are not altered by secondary stable isotope fractionation induced by physical or chemical processes. This makes them a reliable signature, which can be used to establish genetic links between different materials. Most meteorite groups in our inventory have been extensively characterized for isotope anomalies of many elements, revealing a clear dichotomy in the distribution of material in the Solar System. Carbonaceous meteorites, which are thought to originate from beyond the orbit of Jupiter, are generally enriched in the neutron-rich isotopes of Fe-peak elements such as Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Zn ( The diversity among Solar System materials has been exploited in multiple studies that attempted to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition by modeling mixtures between different meteorite groups. Some of these studies have shown that it is possible to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition for various elements by mixing only chondritic meteorites, which are derived from primitive, undifferentiated planetesimals ( A scenario where Earth accreted primarily from chondrites is, however, not without caveats. The mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of chondrites are markedly different from the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) ( Nonetheless, because of analytical challenges that prevented the identification of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of volatile elements for decades, constraints on the origin of Earth’s volatile inventory are much more limited. These elements, which condense at relatively low temperatures of <1100 K ( For many years, volatile-rich objects from the CC reservoir have thus been suggested to have supplied volatiles to the terrestrial planets ( The present study focuses primarily on characterizing the mass-independent Zn isotope compositions of meteorites derived from differentiated planetesimals, including both the silicate and metal fractions, as sampled by achondrites and iron meteorites, respectively, but additional CCs and NCCs are also included (see Materials and Methods). The results are reported using the  The plotted results reflect compiled data from this study and from Martins  In line with other isotope systems and previous Zn results ( The Zn isotope anomalies are likely produced in the same sites as the anomalies of other Fe-peak elements. Thus, the results obtained here are compared to modeled nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies produced by type Ia supernovae (SNIa) ( Group means encompass results from this study and from Martins  Furthermore, the Zn results correlate with measured isotope anomalies of the other Fe-peak elements ( The results are in agreement with predictions for anomalies of ( Notably, the magnitude of the Ca and Ti isotope anomalies appear to increase with the volume of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), while the Zn isotope anomalies stay roughly the same ( While the mass fraction of the carbonaceous material accreted by Earth has been estimated previously using nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of refractory elements, these estimates do not constrain the CC contribution to Earth’s Zn budget. This is because, unlike for refractory elements, the Zn concentrations of different Solar System materials vary substantially. In general, CCs are rich in Zn, with concentrations ranging from ~100 to almost 400 μg g Despite potentially contributing just 10% or less to Earth’s mass ( The simulation was performed for 10,000 trials, but only results that yielded Earth-like compositions (ε The probability density functions (PDF) of the Zn mass fractions derived from CC and NC reservoirs, encompassing 1201 solutions, yield a mean ε Notably, the lower end of the range determined for the CC Zn fraction (~30 to 50%) is compatible with estimates obtained in other recent Zn isotope studies. Steller  These results contrast with an estimate for K, which suggests a contribution of just 20% from CCs ( The search for Earth’s accreting materials has led to multiple studies that used nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as tracers to identify potential building blocks, often arriving at different mixing proportions of CC versus NC materials. An early work by Lodders ( Other studies included achondrites in their estimates, which can lead to very different results. Warren ( There are, however, additional factors that favor the incorporation of achondrites, and hence differentiated planetesimals, in Earth’s building blocks. The mass-dependent Si isotope compositions of achondrites have been shown to be heavier (enriched in higher-mass isotopes) than chondrites, a feature that is also seen in the BSE ( Taking these factors into account, the models discussed in the following attempt to reproduce not only the Earth’s nucleosynthetic isotope composition but also the concentrations of key major elements. The models are based on Monte Carlo simulations in which arbitrarily selected meteorite groups were mixed in randomly generated proportions (Materials and Methods). The isotope data included in the models are Δ Because of the lack of data for some isotope systems (ε The results of the models are shown in  The numbers on the panels correspond to the Run number of the simulation ( Groups included in the models: CI, CM, CO, CV, EH, EL, H, L, LL, eucrite parent body (EPB), angrite parent body (APB), and unsampled materials 1 and 2 (UM1 and UM2: eucrite- and angrite-like elemental abundances and mass-dependent isotope compositions but OC- and EC-like nucleosynthetic isotope compositions for UM1 and UM2, respectively). Checkmarks indicate BE characteristics that are successfully reproduced in each run. In Run 2, 10 Last, Run 3 performed 10 The models suggest that Earth likely accreted an unsampled, volatile-depleted material with an NCC-like nucleosynthetic isotope composition. Therefore, another simulation (Run 4) was performed, which included two hypothetical unsampled materials, representing differentiated planetesimals. Because ECs and OCs accounted for ~90% of the mass in Run 1, which successfully reproduced nucleosynthetic isotope compositions, in Run 4, the unsampled materials are assumed to average out to OC- and EC-like nucleosynthetic isotope compositions, with mean OC and EC values attributed to unsampled materials 1 and 2 (UM1 and UM2), respectively (table S3). Furthermore, achondrites contribute most to Earth’s mass in Run 2 (62 ± 17%), such that their elemental abundances appear to be most compatible with the BE. In addition, the mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of achondrites are also heavier than those of chondrites and largely overlap with BSE values (table S3). Hence, the elemental abundances and mass-dependent Si and Mg isotope compositions of both UM1 and UM2 were allowed to vary within estimates for the EPB and the APB. For Run 4, both the nucleosynthetic isotope and the major element compositions were used as criteria for selection of valid results, in addition to the final BE Zn concentration, which is estimated to be between 40 and 70 μg g The need for some unsampled materials in Earth’s accretion was previously raised because the nucleosynthetic Mo isotope composition of the BSE requires the addition of a material that is more enriched in s-process nuclides than any known meteorites ( However, the effect of this distinct s-process enriched material is much more prominent for the BSE’s Mo isotope composition than for Zr isotopes. In detail, while ~50% of the Mo in the BSE appears to have been supplied by the s-process enriched material ( The different enrichment levels of s-process nuclides inferred from Mo versus Zr and Sr isotopes likely reflect the different metal-silicate partitioning of these elements. In detail, early accreted Mo was largely segregated into the core during differentiation due to the siderophile nature of the element, whereas lithophile Zr and Sr preferentially stayed in the BSE. The BSE’s Mo isotope composition thus reflects the last ~10 to 20% of Earth’s accreting materials, while Zr and Sr record the compositions of most of the Earth’s accreting materials ( Given that the timing of accretion of the different materials is not constrained by the present models, late addition of both CC and unsampled s-process enriched NC materials can be accommodated, in line with the BSE’s Mo isotope composition ( Last, the ε Alternatively, if the mass-independent Si isotope compositions reported by Onyett  Notably, the ε The models presented in this study constrain not only the origin (inner or outer Solar System) but also the extent of volatile depletion of Earth’s precursor materials. In detail, the average Zn concentrations of the materials that provided valid results in Run 4 were calculated, yielding 52 μg g In detail, Hin  Yet, this extensive loss of volatiles during accretion is halted once a differentiated body has enough mass to prevent gaseous molecules from escaping its atmosphere. By comparing the velocities of molecules for an ideal gas under magma ocean conditions with the respective escape velocities, one can estimate the radii required for a planetesimal to retain its volatiles during degassing ( The limited Zn contributions from differentiated planetesimals is in line both with geochemical evidence from achondrites ( Differentiation was ubiquitous among the first bodies to form in the Solar System due to the high abundance of  While materials from the inner Solar System supplied a substantial fraction of the Earth’s Zn budget, the addition of primitive materials that formed at much greater heliocentric distances (CCs) is still required to reproduce the Earth’s nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition. This finding also extends to K, the only other volatile element for which nucleosynthetic anomalies have been identified to date ( Limited mixing between the CC and NC reservoirs has been linked to the scattering of planetesimals and planetary embryos induced by orbital instabilities of the gas giants in the early Solar System ( The study encompassed (i) eight achondrites, including three ureilites, one howardite, two eucrites, one acapulcoite, and one aubrite; (ii) two IAB complex iron meteorites; (iii) three CCs; (iv) six ECs; (v) one OC; and (vi) one R chondrite. Together, 21 meteorites were analyzed, with all relevant information, including meteorite sources, summarized in table S1. Multiple aliquots of the US Geological Survey (USGS) geological reference material BCR-2 were analyzed for quality control. These samples were either used up completely by destructive analysis during the course of the study (Orgueil, Murchison, NWA 13299, MIL 07028, MAC 88136, Tennasilm, Djoua, Nantan, and Toluca) or remaining sample aliquots (Winchcombe, Indarch, PCA 91238, LAR 06025, NWA 11880, NWA 11754, NWA 11757, NWA 11890, NWA 11395, NWA 12265, NWA 8287, and BCR-2) are stored at the Department of Earth Science & Engineering, Imperial College London. Digestion and preparation of the samples and the subsequent Zn isotopic measurements were carried out in the Mass Spectrometry and Isotope Geochemistry (MAGIC) Laboratories at the Department of Earth Science & Engineering of Imperial College London following the procedures outlined by Martins  The original silicate meteorites, weighing between 0.36 and 18.2 g, were crushed in an agate mortar and pestle. Smaller fractions, ranging from 0.158 to 2.74 g, were subsequently aliquoted for this study, depending on the expected Zn content. They (and BCR-2) were then digested in Savillex Teflon beakers as follows. First, they were refluxed in a 2 + 1 mixture of 28 M HF + 15.3 M HNO The isotope analyses were conducted with a Nu Instruments Nu Plasma II multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. A Nu Instruments DSN 100 desolvation system fitted with glass cross flow nebulizers with solution flow rates of about 120 μl min Monitoring of  The solutions were introduced in 0.1 M HNO The Zn results are reported using the ε notation, which denotes deviations of the measured isotope ratio for a sample (sam) from the value determined for the London Zn reference standard (std) in parts per 10 A 10,000-trial Monte Carlo simulation of a mixture between all meteorite groups characterized here and by Martins  The Monte Carlo simulations were designed according to the following equations During core formation, siderophile elements (Mo, Ru, Ni, and Fe) variably partition into the Earth’s core, such that the nucleosynthetic isotope composition of the BSE for these elements is biased toward the compositions of materials that were added relatively late during Earth’s accretion. As such, the models presented here focus on lithophile elements, which trace most of Earth’s accretion. Neodymium was not included, however, because the BSE’s Nd isotope composition was possibly altered by collisional erosion and preferential loss of more incompatible elements ( Notably, estimates for the bulk Zn and Zr concentrations of the APB and EPB are not available, as is the nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition of the APB. The Zn concentrations of the APB and EPB were thus allowed to vary within the observed ranges of the respective meteorites, which correspond to 0.11 to 8.9 μg g Because angrites are rare (only 20 specimens) and have very low Zn contents, it was not possible to characterize the nucleosynthetic Zn isotope composition of this meteorite group for this study.

11468847,Printed Silk Microelectrode Arrays for Electrophysiological Recording and Controlled Drug Delivery,"The use of soft and flexible bioelectronic interfaces can enhance the quality for recording cells’ electrical activity by ensuring a continuous and intimate contact with the smooth, curving surfaces found in the physiological environment. This work develops soft microelectrode arrays (MEAs) made of silk fibroin (SF) films for recording interfaces that can also serve as a drug delivery system. Inkjet printing is used as a tool to deposit the substrate, conductive electrode, and insulator, as well as a drug‐delivery nanocomposite film. This approach is highly versatile, as shown in the fabrication of carbon microelectrodes, sandwiched between a silk substrate and a silk insulator. The technique permits the development of thin‐film devices that can be employed for in vitro extracellular recordings of HL‐1 cell action potentials. The tuning of SF by applying an electrical stimulus to produce a permeable layer that can be used in on‐demand drug delivery systems is also demonstrated. The multifunctional MEA developed here can pave the way for in vitro drug screening by applying time‐resolved and localized chemical stimuli.

Flexible electrode arrays based on polymeric substrates have been developed as bioelectronic surface interfaces.

The use of inkjet printing allowed us to adjust the carbon nanoparticle content in the final film, meaning that the printed device's conductivity can be tuned, whereby a higher carbon nanoparticle content resulted in a printed device with higher conductivity. The following silk‐fibroin‐based materials are the main focus of this work:

A calibration curve was constructed with UV–vis absorption. First, a layer of methylene blue was printed on top of carbon macroelectrode. Next, a silk carbon nanocomposite film was inkjet‐printed to cover the methylene blue layer. The nanocomposite was immersed in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to voltage pulse of 0.5 V for 5 s. UV absorbance spectroscopy was then used to analyze the solution, showing how much methylene blue had been released. The drug release from conventional silk films that were not doped with carbon was also assessed for comparison (Figure  To identify the maximum amount delivered by the silk carbon nanocomposite film, we used different voltages to assess the cumulative release. No methylene blue could be detected under 0.15 V, and a plateau was reached after 0.3 V, indicating that the film could not release any more of the methylene blue after that level (Figure  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used on control structures to examine the carbon–silk nanocomposite film's electrical properties, specifically to show how coatings affect the electrode's impedance across a broad frequency range.  Electrochemical properties of the silk carbon nanocomposite film. Electrochemical impedance spectra recorded in PBS using macroscopic films of bare carbon electrodes, electrodes modified with a silk carbon nanocomposite, and electrodes after voltage trigger. In order to demonstrate film functionality, a proof‐of‐concept experiment was designed to explore whether the voltage pulse triggered release of fluorescein nanoparticles. First, we directly printed a single drop of fluorescein nanoparticles (diameter of 100 nm) onto a carbon microelectrode. This was then covered by a drop of the carbon–silk nanocomposite film. Afterward, we used fluorescence microscopy to image the release of the fluorescein following electrical stimulation, which enabled the quantification of the amount of fluorescein released.

Figure  For future work, rather than using glass to support the ultrathin MEA for in vitro applications, we envision that a biodegradable material such as gelatin or silk could serve as a temporary stiffener for in vivo applications. This work describes a novel silk‐based MEA that is both soft and ultraflexible. The MEA is a sandwich construction of a silk–carbon nanocomposite in between a substrate and an insulator, both also made of silk. We have demonstrated how layers with various properties, including conductive, insulating or electro‐responsive characteristics, can be achieved by varying the composition of the silk ink. When used as an insulator in a physiological environment the silk barrier showed good stability over 30 days. Using models with methylene blue and fluorescein nanoparticles, we examined the drug release behavior of this nanocomposite in the form of macro and microelectrodes, demonstrating that by tuning its properties it can serve as a drug‐delivery platform that can be controlled electrically. Such a precise technique for on‐demand drug delivery would pave the way for effective therapies with reduced toxic effects as the drug delivery could be adjusted to meet the temporal and spatial requirements of specific conditions. Moreover, in vitro assays may also benefit from such a controlled delivery, for example, when performing high‐volume drug screening or as part of cell biology investigations. Because the properties of the silk nanocomposite can be adjusted, facilitating both stability and dosing control, the platform described here may contribute to the development of new drug delivery techniques based on customized drug‐release profiles. Last, the silk MEAs were shown to be applicable for the in vitro extracellular recording of the action potential of HL‐1 cells. Future work should consider using a biodegradable silk layer as a temporary stiffener for the implementation of devices for in vivo applications. The process of preparing the carbon ink was done as in prior work. A Dimatix Materials Printer (Dimatix DMP‐2850, Fujifilm Dimatix Inc., USA) was used to produce the MEAs. The inks were first prepared for printing by sonicating them for 5 min, and then they were passed through a 0.2 µm PVDF syringe filter. The following parameters were employed in the printing process: 2.4 pL Samba cartridges (Fujifilm Dimatix Inc., USA), a 1 kHz jetting frequency, a 22 µm drop spacing, a substrate holder and printhead temperature of 21 °C, a 16 µs jetting period, and a 40 V jetting voltage. For the planar substrates, the printhead‐substrate distance was 250 µm. To ensure the easy handling of the ultra‐flexible MEA, SF was jetted onto glass substrates or 50 µm PEN foil. The noradrenaline ink (NA ink) consisted of 60 wt % NA solution (10 m Aqueous SFn solution was prepared using the established purification protocol. For all release experiments of electro‐responsive printed silk carbon nanocomposites, modified electrodes were immersed in PBS and submitted to release stimulation. The PBS solutions containing the released methylene blue were analyzed with UV–vis spectroscopy (Analytik Jena Specord 200 [Jenoptik, Germany]) at a wavelength of 662 nm to quantify the amount of methylene blue released. To determine the cumulative release of the methylene blue in response to voltage stimulation, the release solution was removed for analysis at given voltage pulses was collected and measured using UV–vis spectroscopy. All the measurements were carried out in ambient atmosphere using a commercial s‐SNOM in reflection mode (neaSNOM, attocube Systems AG). A PtIr‐coated AFM tip (Arrow‐NCPt, NanoAndMore GmbH) was illuminated using a coherent, broadband pulsed beam from a difference frequency generation laser source (TOPTICA Photonics AG). The output beam was set to the 1200–2200 cm All chips were incubated with deionized water for 5 min for cleaning before the electrochemical measurements were performed. A reservoir was produced by adhering the MEAs to glass rings 10 mm high and with a 7 mm diameter using PDMS. A Biological potentiostat (VSP‐300 potentiostat from BioLogic Science Instruments) was utilized to conduct the electrochemical experiments. The medium for all experiments was PBS as a supporting electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl electrode (Super Dri‐Ref SDR 2; World Precision Instruments, USA) was used to reference the recorded signals. The sheet resistances were measured using a four‐point probe head from Jandel connected to a Keysight B2900A source measuring unit. The MEAs were incubated in 70% ethanol for 10 min for sterilization, after which they were rinsed using sterile distilled water. Next, a coating comprising 2.5 µg cm For the statistical assessment of the results presented (HL‐1 cellular recording using silk MEA), MATLAB's findpeaks* function was employed to detect the individual spikes having a minimum peak prominence of six times the standard deviation of the trace. To calculate the background noise, the regions with spikes were ignored and the standard deviation was calculated on the remaining data. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

11468547,Tissue‐Engineered Cochlear Fibrosis Model Links Complex Impedance to Fibrosis Formation for Cochlear Implant Patients,"Cochlear implants are a life‐changing technology for those with severe sensorineural hearing loss, partially restoring hearing through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, they are known to elicit an immune response resulting in fibrotic tissue formation in the cochlea that is linked to residual hearing loss and suboptimal outcomes. Intracochlear fibrosis is difficult to track without postmortem histology, and no specific electrical marker for fibrosis exists. In this study, a tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis is developed following implant placement to examine the electrical characteristics associated with fibrotic tissue formation around electrodes. The model is characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and an increase in the resistance and a decrease in capacitance of the tissue using a representative circuit are found. This result informs a new marker of fibrosis progression over time that is extractable from voltage waveform responses, which can be directly measured in cochlear implant patients. This marker is tested in a small sample size of recently implanted cochlear implant patients, showing a significant increase over two postoperative timepoints. Using this system, complex impedance is demonstrated as a marker of fibrosis progression that is directly measurable from cochlear implants to enable real‐time tracking of fibrosis formation in patients, creating opportunities for earlier treatment intervention to improve cochlear implant efficacy. This study focuses on the development of a tissue‐engineered system for mimicking fibrotic response occurring after cochlear implant placement, enabling real‐time monitoring of implant electrical response. A representative circuit model, informed by electrical impedance spectroscopy, is constructed for this tissue‐engineered system, and a new electrical fibrosis marker is found that corroborates with observations during cochlear implant healing in patients.
","Hearing loss affects 20% of the world's population with an ≈5% needing clinical intervention. Implants are known to elicit an inflammatory response, associated with fibrotic encapsulation. Despite the relevance of intracochlear fibrosis to residual hearing loss, we possess few methods for tracking fibrosis in CI patients. In this study, we investigate complex impedance as a biomarker for fibrosis progression by developing a 3D tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis. We replicate the intracochlear fibrotic environment by encapsulating clinical‐grade CI electrode arrays inside tissue‐engineered fibroblast‐seeded fibrin gel constructs. We show significant and consistent changes in complex impedance over time, with which we produce a realistic electrical circuit model for fibrosis development. We also utilize full voltage waveform measurements to propose an electrical marker of fibrosis development that could be implemented clinically, finding similar electrical behavior in our measurements of patient samples. The results presented in this study and the markers we propose will enable us to track cochlear fibrosis progression in real‐time, allowing for earlier treatment intervention for combating residual hearing loss for CI patients. We modeled cochlear fibrosis by producing a fibrous sheath around a clinical‐grade cochlear electrode array. To generate this model, we injected molded fibrin gels containing fibroblasts into a 3D‐printed mold, with the cochlear electrode array centered on the axis. These electrode arrays with cell‐seeded gel constructs were suspended in culture media inside a conical bioreactor, to set the electrode array and ground electrode location for consistent electrical measurement ( Schematic of 3D bioreactor setup. A) Schematic of the tissue‐engineered cochlear fibrosis model construct including a cochlear implant electrode array encapsulated with a fibrin gel with 3D‐seeded fibroblasts. e1 represents the first/most apical electrode. B) Image of the three apical electrode contacts including connecting wires. We observed considerable axial contraction of the constructs ( Contraction and histology analysis of the constructs. A) Representative image set showing contraction of the construct over the course of the experiment. The length of the construct was calculated using the known mid‐to‐mid contact spacing of the electrode arrays to calculate the scale of the images for each electrode array and timepoint separately, which was then used to calculate the length of the construct. B) Relative contraction of the constructs, normalized to day 0 absolute length, over time. Single datapoints are shown in grey lines with open circles. Mean ± standard deviation is shown for the stimulated and unstimulated groups (ns = not significant, univariate n‐way ANCOVA) in bold as well as all constructs. Relative contraction is significant over time ( Next, we performed histology to retrieve information on cellular orientation and extracellular matrix morphology (Figure  Use of electrical stimulation as a method to prevent CI fibrosis has sparked recent interest. Given that constructs axially contract, we found in some cases, constructs would contract away from electrodes that were covered on day 0. To understand the 3D structure of the constructs relative to positioning along the arrays, samples ( Confocal fluorescence imaging of the construct. 3D orientation of the construct, as fixed on day 14, related to the electrode array.

B) Total and close‐up of a stimulated construct. Both constructs show attachment of the cells on the electrode surfaces. Actin fibers in the cells can be seen spreading out over the surface of the electrodes and numerous cells are attached to a singular electrode alone. Within the statistical tests described in this section, an effect of experiment number was found on relative contraction and DNA quantification (Figures  We hypothesized that complex impedance would change as measured via EIS with cellular contraction and construct remodeling. To test this hypothesis, we tracked complex impedance spectra over six timepoints to day 14. These spectra were fitted to a circuit model ( Complex impedance measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS was measured on all electrodes, regardless of having an open circuit (e.g., air bubble or broken electrode). The exclusion criteria, as described in the materials & methods section, led to  Fitted circuit elements over time with construct on showed CPE phase (CPE‐P) and magnitude (CPE‐T) stay constant, while circuit element R A commonly studied circuit to model contact impedances in relation to cochlear fibrosis was introduced by Tykocinski et al. and includes a resistor in parallel with a capacitor representing EE interface and a single resistor in series representing the bulk of tissue (Figure  To translate the changes in complex impedance to an electrical measurable in patients, we measured voltage waveforms at all timepoints for electrodes with and without construct on ( Measured voltage waveforms, contact “impedances” and SPPR over time. Voltage waveforms were only measured when EIS measurements were included and a single pulse did not elicit high voltage waveform responses, leading to  Contact impedances, voltage at the end of the first phase of a cathodic‐leading pulse normalized to the input current, were calculated with (Figure  We hypothesized that with an increase in R To compare change in SPPR over time with a single measure to EIS‐fitted circuit elements R To expand information extraction from voltage waveforms, we reverse fitted (voltage waveform (VW) fitted) (Figure  Reverse fitting of voltage waveforms (VW) to electrical circuit.

We used the CI company's software function to measure mutliple timepoints along voltage waveform response, to measure an altered version of SPPR (6 µs into each phase) as well as compare this to the contact impedances ( Contact “impedances” and altered SPPR of four recently implanted CI patients. A) Schematic of input current (dashed line), measured timepoints (circles), and analyzed timepoints (filled circles). An example response from a patient is shown in turquoise. B) Contact “impedances”, as measured at the end of the first phase (25 µs), intraoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, and 5 months postoperatively for four patients. Individual data are shown in grey, the mean of each patient is shown in bold. A significant increase in contact “impedances” is seen from intra‐op to post‐op on group level ( Contact impedances showed a significant increase from intraoperative to postoperative timepoints (F = 139.1,  SPPR was only available for two postoperative timepoints (Figure  Mean comfortable loudness levels (MCLs), expressed in the log‐scale unit of current levels (CLs), were available for the 3 and 5 months postoperative timepoints for a subset of electrodes. MCLs are complex and likely to vary due to patient‐related factors such as, but not limited to, auditory nerve survival and central factors. Therefore, we looked at the relationship between change in SPPR and contact impedances with change in MCLs, as to correct for between‐patient differences in absolute MCL. When looking at changes in contact impedances and SPPR (Figure  In this study, we tissue engineered a 3D model of cochlear fibrosis that behaves similarly to data we collected from a postoperative population of patients with cochlear implants. This model was designed to improve our understanding of the fibrotic response that occurs during cochlear implantation and ideally will be used in conjunction with large‐scale human data collection and animal models to improve outcomes for patients experiencing the effects of fibrosis from the placement of a cochlear implant. We used a tissue‐engineered, cell‐seeded gel to simulate the electrical environment of a fibrosing cochlear implant on a clinical cochlear electrode array. We analyzed these data both biologically and electrically to confirm the usefulness of this system as a model for cochlear fibrosis. Finding that we could recreate some of the conditions that we observed in a patient population, we developed a new marker based on our electrical data that was also found to increase in our postoperative patient‐derived data at group level. Cochlear implants are known to cause fibrosis formation in the cochlea that can lead to residual hearing loss for cochlear implant patients. Our tissue‐engineered model of cochlear fibrosis has the advantage of including the electrode array that is used in the clinical setting for CI patients, as well as incorporating the 3D aspect of fibrous tissue encapsulation that is known to behave differently from 2D tissue. To design a new electrical marker of fibrosis progression, we first needed to understand the complex impedance changes over time in our model. We proposed a new electrical circuit to represent the changes in our model of cochlear fibrosis and showed significant changes in complex impedance over time. The elements representing the bulk of the construct (R EIS revealed changes in both impedance magnitude and phase angle over time and when modeled with our proposed circuit, revealed significant changes for those circuit elements representing the bulk of the construct. The changes in R To allow for easily measurable data in CI patients using current clinical software and to provide a comparison with currently collected data from patients, we measured voltage waveform responses at each electrode. The clinically measurable contact impedances showed an increase over time, which is in line with studies examining contact impedances and fibrosis formation. We fitted our circuit model of fibrosis encapsulation to voltage waveforms measured and found significant correlations with the output of complex impedance fitting, showing an opportunity for additional information extraction from voltage waveforms in CI patients, which is possible with research software. The model presented in this paper could be used as a drug‐testing platform, where changes in complex impedance, SPPR, and contraction could be used to test ways to inhibit or even reverse fibrosis. Patient biopsies could be used to build patient‐specific models of cochlear fibrosis. In our study, we did not observe any effects on our cells from applied electrical stimulation, despite contrary observations in some studies. As our system is meant to represent the immune response to CI implantation, we have notably not included immune cells within this model. Fibrosis in vivo is complex and involves other cell types beyond just fibroblasts. One limitation of this model is that clinical fibrous encapsulation is attached to the walls of the cochlea, making longitudinal contraction to the levels seen in our study less likely. In conclusion, this study presents a tissue‐engineered model of fibrosis progression on a clinical cochlear implant array. It demonstrates complex impedance as a marker of fibrosis progression and applies the changes found in complex impedance to directly measurable cochlear implant patient data. A new marker, the SPPR, provides a potential mechanism for gauging cochlear implant fibrosis formation progress in patients, with no additional software or equipment needed. These findings can be used to track fibrosis formation in patients in real‐time, allowing for earlier treatment intervention, and can be used in drug‐testing platforms to test and develop new treatments inhibiting fibrosis and therefore combating residual hearing loss. The findings in this study hold the potential for generalization to other neural implants with fibrosis formation, opening up new areas of exploration and treatment, for improving implant science. The overall goal of this study was to find an electrical biomarker for the development of fibrosis in a 3D bioreactor model with visual feedback in real‐time. The 3D bioreactor models (Figure  During six timepoints over a course of 14 days, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and full voltage waveform responses were measured for the stimulated group. Additionally, contraction status of the construct was captured with a hand‐held digital microscope at seven timepoints (including day 0). The experiments were repeated three times, with five bioreactors in the first round ( The experiments were ended on day 14 to prevent the construct from contracting off the electrode fully, at which point not enough tissue would be available for a follow‐up assay. Outliers that were present in the electrical dataset were excluded based on their complex impedance response (see EIS section for details). For a detailed description of the experimental methods described in the results, see the Detailed Methods section in the Supporting Information. MED‐EL (Innsbruck, Austria) cochlear implant electrode arrays were manufactured for the purpose of this study. The electrode arrays are identical to the arrays of clinical implants within the MED‐EL FLEX series, consisting of 12 platinum‐iridium contacts in a silicone array (Figure  Prior to placing the electrode array and ground within culture media in the conical, a fibrin gel was cast around the electrode array. A 3D‐printed platform was designed to keep the electrode array in place, while the construct was cast within a 3% w/v Pluronic‐coated (Pluronic F‐127, Sigma–Aldrich) silicone tube. The protocol for fibrin gel fabrication follows the Roberts et al. approach. To track localization of the construct relative to the individual electrodes, photos were taken at seven timepoints (on the day of fabrication and every measurement timepoint thereafter) using digital microscope (Dino‐Lite, Premier AM4113T). Whether the construct was on or off individual electrodes was decided by visual inspection and subsequent analysis (EIS and voltage waveform analysis) was grouped on this basis. Contraction analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Image scaling was calibrated to the known mid‐to‐mid electrode contact spacing for each image. The mean and standard deviation of the calculated scaling was then used to calculate the length of the construct. Error bars in Figure  DNA was quantified for a subset of constructs following the Kim et al. protocol for papain digestion of the constructs and Hoechst 33258 fluorescence assays. Samples for histology were prepped on day 14 by fixing the construct in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Thermo Scientific) for 2 h. Thereafter, the construct was removed from the electrode array and cut in transversal and longitudinal slices (Figure  Samples (2 constructs, from Exp3, one stimulated, one unstimulated) for confocal imaging were fixed on day 14 in 4% PFA for 15 min. While keeping the construct on the electrode array, the construct was permeabilized for 10 min with 1% Triton‐X (Fisher Scientific) in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS, Oxoid Ltd.). The constructs were first incubated with phalloidin‐iFluor 594 reagent (Abcam) for 1.5 h at a concentration of 4 µL mL The electrode array and ground electrode were connected to an impedance analyzer (RS PRO LCR‐6100) via printed circuit boards and a data acquisition system (DAQ, USB‐6212, National Instruments), powered by a power supply (Keithley 2614B SourceMeter). An AC signal with an amplitude of 100 mV was used to collect complex impedances from 10 Hz to 100 kHz, with 10 frequencies per decade at equivalent logarithmic intervals. The order of stimulation of the electrodes on the array was randomized using LabVIEW (v2018, National Instruments Corp.) to a total of three repeats per electrode per timepoint. The mean and standard deviation per three repeats were calculated for the absolute impedance magnitude and the corresponding phase angle in MATLAB. To exclude outliers (e.g., broken electrodes or an air bubble present on the electrode), timepoints for individual electrodes on the arrays were excluded when the 25% highest standard deviations of the phase angle ( EIS data was then modeled using ZView (v3.1, Scribner Associates Inc.) to fit an equivalent circuit (Figure  The data were then fitted using ZView's complex calc‐modulus data weighting fitting, with a maximum of 100 iterations and 100 optimization iterations. Circuit element  Additionally, an example response was fitted with the simple circuit described for voltage waveform responses of cochlear implants (Figure  In order to measure full voltage waveforms, as measured during clinical contact impedances, the electrode array was connected to a CI emulator (Advanced Bionics, AB, CA, USA). With this emulator, current stimuli can be generated by the Bionic Ear Data Collection System software (BEDCS, AB) when connected to a headpiece, an external sound processor (AB Clarion Platinum), a Clinician's Programming Interface (CPI‐2, AB‐6500, Clarion) and a laptop. The electrode array was stimulated with monopolar biphasic charge‐balanced pulses with a phase duration of 50 µsec and an amplitude of 50 µA, both cathodic‐leading and anodic‐leading. Recordings were made with an oscilloscope (Teledyne LeCroy HDO4054A‐MS, LeCroy Corp., New York, USA). The order of stimulation, and thus recording, were randomized using LabVIEW to a total of 15 repeats per pulse and electrode. When EIS recordings exhibited unusual high absolute impedances across all frequencies, the electrode was excluded from voltage waveform data collection for that timepoint. The collected voltage waveforms were filtered using a first order digital Butterworth low‐pass filter with a cut‐off frequency of 80 kHz, using MATLAB's function  Clinically measurable contact impedances were calculated by taking the peak of the first phase of the cathodic‐leading biphasic pulse and dividing it by the input current (50 µA). Additionally, the SPPR was calculated (Figure  To correlate the second phase voltage peak ratio with EIS‐fitted circuit elements, a linear function was fitted to the SPPR over time using MATLAB's  After modeling the EIS circuits to the data, voltage waveforms were simulated with the outputs of the model in a similar fashion to Jiang et al. Since Ohm's law states the voltage is the product of current and impedance, the voltage can be expressed as:
 To obtain the voltage waveform response in the time‐domain, an inverse Laplace transform was performed on the formula for voltage in the frequency‐domain:
 This can be solved so that the voltage ( To find the circuit elements, the normalized, filtered, mean voltage waveform of 15 repeats was used as an input. All voltage waveforms were fitted for which a comparative EIS fitting was available on day 2. First, the step function  Data were collected from four patients implanted with a Cochlear Ltd. (Sydney, Australia) using Custom Sound EP 6.0, which allows for data collection of voltage per unit input current at several timepoints within the waveform.

11468513,Agent-Object Relationships in Level-2 Visual Perspective Taking: An Eye-Tracking Study,"Visual perspective taking (VPT) generates a shared frame of reference for understanding how the world appears to others. Whilst greater cognitive and neurophysiological demands are associated with increasing angular distance between the self and other is well documented, accompanying attentional characteristics are not currently understood. Furthermore, although age and group status have been shown to impact task performance, other important cues, such as the relationship between agents and objects, have not been manipulated. Therefore, 35 university students participated in an eye-tracking experiment where they completed a VPT task with agents positioned at a low or high angular disparity (45° or 135° respectively). The congruence between the age of the agent (child vs adult) and the object they are attending to (e.g., teddy-bear vs kettle) was also manipulated. Participants were required to respond to the direction of the object from the agent’s position. The findings reveal more fixations and increased dwell-times on agents compared to objects, but this was moderated by the age of the task agent. Results also showed more attentional transitions between agents and objects at higher angular disparities. These results converge with behavioural and neurophysiological descriptions of task performance in previous studies. Furthermore, the congruency of the relationship between agents and objects also impacted attention shifting and response times, highlighting the importance of understanding how social cues and contexts can modulate VPT processes in everyday contexts and social interaction.","Representing the visual perspectives of others is a fundamental sociocognitive process. Evidence supports a distinction between the ‘level 1’ computations which are fast, involuntary, and required for visibility judgments (L1-VPT;  To-date, no eye-tracking experiments have been conducted with L2-VPT, yet eye-tracking data from L1-VPT and related processes such as gaze-cueing reveal significant effects of task manipulations. For example, work on gaze-cueing reveals preferential attention to in-group others (for a review see  Understanding the influence of social cues on perspective representation is also gaining increasing attention. To date, VPT has been shown to be affected by social factors such as group status ( A close thematic relationship between agent and object (e.g., ‘doctor’ and ‘stethoscope’) results from the cooccurrence of one or multiple semantic features which are processed by a general representational mechanism ( Crucially for VPT tasks, where an agent typically looks at an object in front of them, Becchio et al’s ( In summary, this pre-registered study ( Replicating previous behavioural findings ( Extending previous ingroup effects on VPT ( We hypothesise that congruent age-object relationships will result in significantly quicker response times (akin to  To supplement the pre-registered hypotheses, and for clarity, there is currently no evidence for any outcome measure to hypothesise an interaction between angular disparity and object congruence, angular disparity and avatar-age, object-congruence and avatar-age, or a three-way interaction. 35 participants (27 female) from XXXXX participated for course credit or were recruited via advertisements placed around campus and paid £5.00. 1 participant was removed due to low overall accuracy (<66%). The final sample included 34 participants (26 female;  A 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures design with three independent variables of angle (low vs high), avatar-age (child vs adult) and object-relevance (relevant vs irrelevant) as factors. Example stimuli can be seen in  Example stimuli to demonstrate manipulations of avatar-age, object congruence and angular disparity. Participants completed an adapted version of the Kessler and Thomson ( Participants rested their heads on a fixed chin rest 60 cm from the 19 inch (360 × 270 mm) ViewSonic Graphic Series G90fB coloured display screen. The left eye of participants was recorded using an EyeLink 1000+ eye-tracker running at 1000 Hz. Participants were shown example images of the objects facing left and right (see Figure X for some examples). Participants were then shown example experimental stimuli (see Figure X) and told that they had to respond to whether the object was facing right or left from the avatars position using the ‘Q’ for leftward and ‘P’ for rightward. Each trial began with a fixation cross lasting 750 ms and was followed by the experimental stimuli that remained on screen until a response was made or 8 seconds had elapsed. The experimental stimuli were 1024 × 460 pixels and appeared centrally on the screen; this corresponds to 33.4 × 15.35° of visual angle which should mean participants had to move their gaze to focus on the individuals sat at the seating positions (a graphic with the standard 5° of visual angle (149.03 × 149.03 pixels) laid over an example stimulus can be seen in  The red square represents 5° of visual angle from the centre of the screen.

First, to supplement behavioural and neurophysiological distinctions between low and high angular judgements with attention data. Second, to further examine the effects of avatar characteristic in L2-VPT using eye-tracking to measure the number of fixations, the number of transitions between agents and target objects, and the proportion of time spent fixating on the agents and objects. Third, to explore whether stronger thematic relationships between agent and object impact L2-VPT similarly to how they affect gaze judgements ( A corpus of work supports the distinction between processing level-2 visual perspectives at low and high angular disparity ( Evidence is increasing that agent attributes such as humanness, group-status and age affect the computation of visual perspectives ( Whilst acknowledging that salient characteristics modulate attention in previous research (e.g.,  As hypothesised, agent-object incongruence increased the number of AOI transitions, extending the known influence of thematic relationships on language comprehension ( Object relevance was also found to interact with avatar-age. Whilst object relevance did not affect response times for adult avatars, for child avatars, age-relevant objects reduced response times and age-irrelevant objects increased response times. This suggests that while less interference is experienced from incongruent cues when paired with an in-group member, additional social cues facilitate or disrupt perspective representation of outgroup others. Importantly, real-world experience is important for developing thematic relationships ( The interaction between avatar-age and object relevance visible in eye-tracking data was modulated by angular disparity. At low angles, where perspective taking can rely on an egocentric frame of reference ( On all trials, objects and agents were located in predictable positions. Real-world social cues are often dynamic with regular gaze shifts, varying distances and changing agent-object relationships. To better resemble real-world social processing, future eye-tracking research could vary room layouts or present stimuli as to encourage naturalistic viewing behaviour ( Our angular disparity findings raise an interesting question regarding attention allocation required for different types of L2-VPT. Previous work distinguishes between visual and spatial forms of L2-VPT and finds that judging whether a ‘6’ or ‘9’ appears on the left or right is more effortful than whether the agent ‘sees’ a ‘6’ or ‘9’ ( Evidence that agent-object relationships significantly impact cognitive effort and attention allocation in L2-VPT demonstrate the role of perspective representation in understanding intentionality and predicting behaviour. Our results are the first to demonstrate the effects angular disparity on attention allocation in L2-VPT, extending the current cognitive and neurophysiological evidence ( Raw data available at: ","['visual perspective taking', 'level-2', 'agent object relationships', 'object congruency', 'intentionality', 'eye-tracking', 'stereotype']",,Journal of Cognition,STD

Conventional treatments for POI are inadequate, and treatments based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as an option.

The CTX-induced mouse POI model was established per the protocol described previously [ We performed actimetry according to established procedures [ The collected ovaries were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C for 24 h. The specimens were then dehydrated, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin wax, serially sectioned into 5-μm-thick slices, and mounted on glass slides. Hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed on every tenth sample from three consecutive slides, sampled from a total of 20 ovaries across 4 experimental groups ( Ovarian and SCN tissues, pcMSCs, and KGN cells were collected and homogenized, and their total RNA was isolated using an EasyPure Total RNA Spin Kit (Bioman Scientific, Taiwan) per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). We synthesized cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT, M1705, Promega, USA). Ovary RNA (2000 ng) and SCN RNA (400 ng) were mixed with a reverse transcriptase master mix in a final volume of 25 μL. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 50°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 10 min. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in 96-well plates on a LightCycler 96 (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) by using the Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (15,350,929, Applied Biosystems, MA, USA). PCR reactions were conducted using a mixture comprising 5 μL of SYBR Green I Master, 2.5 μL of RNAse-free water, 2 μL of 30 nM primer mix, and 0.5 μL of cDNA for a total volume of 10 μL. Three technical replicates were performed for each sample. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial cycle was performed for 20 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles for 10 s at 95°C, 20 s at 60°C, and 20 s at 72°C. Melting curve analyses for determining the dissociation of PCR products were performed at between 65 and 95°C. The PCR efficiencies of the primers was evaluated by examining the samples through the use of six standards in triplicate (diluted in fivefold series). Two reference genes ( The collected cells and ovaries were lysed with RIPA buffer (Energenesis Biomedical, Taiwan) along with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Total protein solutions were obtained by centrifuging the lysed samples at 14,000 rpm for 25 min at 4°C. The protein concentration was detected using the Pierce BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein (30 µg) in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer were separated by applying electrophoresis to 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel, after which the separated proteins were transferred to pure polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon, Merck Millipore, Germany). The membranes were placed in 5% skimmed milk for 1 h to block nonspecific binding and were then incubated with corresponding primary antibodies (Table S2). They were then washed three times with tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer (Bioman, Taiwan) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Bioshop, Canada). After undergoing rinsing, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:3000). Finally, they were visualized using Immobilon Western (Millipore, Germany) and imaged using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare, USA). Band density was quantified using ImageJ software 1.53u (NIH Image, USA), β-actin was used as an internal control. Slides were incubated in a heating chamber at 60°C for 30 min, immersed in xylene, and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 20 min at 98°C for antigen retrieval and were subsequently washed with TBS and permeabilization with TBST (0.2% Tween 20 in TBS solution). These sections were then blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, S-1000, USA) for 1 h. After blocking, the slides were incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: CYP19A1 (Abcam, ab18995, UK), PER2 (Abcam, ab227727, UK), RORA (Proteintech, 10616-1-AP, USA), and Rev-Erbα (NR1D1, Proteintech, 13906-1-AP, USA). Subsequently, they were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, USA) for 1 h. Finally, the sections were stained with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine substrates (Vector Laboratories, USA). For confocal fluorescence detection, the slides were subjected to incubation overnight with mouse anti-PCNA (Chemicon, CBL407, Germany) or double staining with cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, #9961, USA) by using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (TUNEL assay, Roche, Cat. No.11684817910, Switzerland). Double immunofluorescence staining was also performed using antibodies against CD31 (550274, BD Pharmingen, USA) and VEGF-A (ab183100, Abcam, UK). On the next day, after being washed with TBST, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor-594–labeled goat anti-mouse IgG/goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, USA) and then counterstained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Fluorescence signals were detected using a Stellaris 8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). KGN cell cultures grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% newly prepared paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with cold TBST for 10 min, and incubated with a blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum in TBST for 1 h. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies for the proteins: Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580, UK) and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, #9961, USA). Subsequently, the coverslips were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (Life Technologies, USA), and F-actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (Invitrogen, A12381, USA). Fluorescence signals were detected using a confocal Stellaris 8 microscope (Leica, Germany). Table S2 presents the experimental conditions for the antibodies used for Western blotting or immunostaining. To perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), serum samples were obtained from the mice in each experimental group to evaluate the levels of AMH (MBS2507173, MyBioSource, CA, USA), E2 (MBS261250, MyBioSource, CA, USA), and FSH (MBS2507988, MyBioSource, CA, USA). Fresh CM and E2-CM from four consecutive passages were used to quantify angiogenin (ELH-ANG, Raybiotech, GA, USA). All assays were conducted using ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’ instructions. KGN cells were treated with Allophycocyanin (APC) Annexin V in a staining buffer containing propidium iodide (BioLegend, USA) per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The samples were analyzed using a BD FACSVerse system and the software BD FACSuite (CA, USA). The cytokines in CM/E2-CM were detected using antibody array-based technology (Human Cytokine Arrays C5, RayBiotech, USA). Each array was incubated with CM/E2-CM (700 µg/ml) at 4°C overnight in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals on the membranes were imaged using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini system (GE Healthcare, USA). Integrated densities were measured using ImageJ 1.53u. The samples were normalized on the basis of six spots of positive controls and the background of the surrounding area. To obtain the exosomes in CM and E2-CM, the ER Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol LS reagent (10296010, Invitrogen, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration was determined by using a spectrophotometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop Technology, USA) to measure absorbance at 260 nm. The quantity of RNA was evaluated by using a LabChip RNA 6000 kit (Agilent Technologies, USA) and the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology). Sample libraries were prepared using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit (Qiagen, Germany) per the manufacturer’s guidelines, and subsequently they were sequenced using an Illumina instrument (75-cycle single-end read, 75SE). The miRNA data obtained in the present study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE247568. The collected sequencing data were analyzed using the Illumina BCL2FASTQ v2.20 software (Illumina, USA) for demultiplexing. We used Trimmomatic to isolate high-quality reads, discarding those shorter than 18 nucleotides [ Total exosomal RNA extracted above, including miRNA, was used to conduct quantitative analysis of miRNA by qPCR. cDNA was synthesized using the miRCURY LNA RT Kit (Cat#339340, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the miScript HiSpec Buffer in the kit, allowing selective conversion of mature miRNAs but not precursors. Mature miRNAs were polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase and reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo-dT primers. Polyadenylation and reverse transcription were performed in parallel in the same tube. The expression of the miRNAs of interest was assessed via qPCR using the miRCURY LNA SYBR Green PCR kit (Cat#339345 Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). U6 (RNU6-1) snRNA was chosen as the internal control for microRNAs. Primers were designed based on a miRNA-specific stem loop-RT assay [ All experiments were performed at least three times. The collected data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.3, USA) and were presented as means ± SDs. An unpaired Student’s  The effects of CTX on the POI-associated ovarian morphology, sex hormones, and mouse body weight were analyzed. As presented in Supplementary Fig. 1, the CTX-induced POI mice exhibited significant weight loss (Fig. S1A), reduced ovary size, poor ovarian morphology (Fig. S1B), impaired folliculogenesis (Fig. S1C and D), decreased serum E2 and AMH levels, increased serum FSH levels (Fig. S1E), and decreased CYP19A1 protein levels (Fig. S1F). These results indicate the successful establishment of a CTX-induced POI mouse model. Estrogen is produced by granulosa cells. It stimulates ovarian folliculogenesis and plays a key role in the interaction between granulosa cells and surrounding niche cells [ We previously demonstrated that pcMSC (same source as ER The mice were divided into four groups, namely the control group comprising healthy controls, the POI group comprising CTX-induced POI mice, the CM group comprising POI mice treated with CM, and the E2-CM group comprising POI mice treated with E2-CM. The POI mice were intraperitoneally injected with PBS, CM, or E2-CM. The experimental designs are presented shown in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM improved ovary function in CTX-induced POI animal model.  To determine the effects of CM/E2-CM on ovarian damage due to CTX-induced POI, immunohistochemical staining for PCNA was performed; PCNA is an indicator of cell proliferation. As revealed in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM protected GCs from apoptosis in CTX-induced POI animal model. To elucidate the effects of CM and E2-CM on granulosa cell apoptosis, the human KGN granulosa cell line was used to establish an in vitro cell model (Fig. S3A). In the present study, 4-OOH-CP (8 μg/ml), an active form of CTX, was employed to test the effects of CM and E2-CM (Fig. S3B). The flow cytometry analysis results reveal that, when compared with the 4-OOH-CP-treated KGN cells (Mock group), those treated with CM or E2-CM exhibited significantly reduced 4-OOH-CP-induced early and late cell apoptosis (Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore granulosa cell viability in CTX-challenged KGN cell model.  Estrogen is closely associated with circadian rhythm regulation [ Figure  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore ovarian circadian rhythm in CTX-induced POI animal model.  We analyzed the gene expression related to estrogen biosynthesis ( Moreover, cells expressing  As was true with  The impact of CM and E2-CM on the expression of circadian proteins REV-ERBα and E4BP4 in ovarian granulosa cells was further validated through immunofluorescence staining using KGN cells in vitro. Our findings revealed that the CTX analog 4-OOH-CP significantly increased nuclear REV-ERBα levels, while CM/E2-CM effectively attenuated this effect of 4-OOH-CP (Fig.  We hypothesized that the interplay between circadian rhythm disruptions and the components contributing to POI can be reflected in circadian locomotor rhythms. The disruptive effect of CTX and the repairing effects of CM and E2-CM were studied by examining the locomotor activity in POI mice. The experimental design is detailed in Fig.  pcMSC-CM and E2-CM restore period in locomotor activity in CTX-induced POI animal model.  Neovascularization plays a key role in ovarian hormone production and folliculogenesis. To investigate the potential role of CM and E2-CM in restoring CTX-induced angiogenesis defect in vivo, the protein levels of CD31 (a marker for vascular differentiation) and VEGF-A in ovarian tissues subjected to different experimental conditions were analyzed. We discovered that CTX treatment considerably reduced the protein levels of CD31 and VEGF-A in the ovarian tissues of the experimental mice, and that CM and E2-CM treatments significantly restored the CTX-induced defects (Fig.  CM and E2-CM promoted angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, possibly with angiogenin involvement. To explore the potential mechanisms underlying the aforementioned findings, cytokine array analysis was performed to identify the cytokines of CM and E2-CM that might be involved in angiogenesis (angiogenin and TNFRSF11), extracellular matrix regulation (TIMP1 and TIMP2), immunoregulation (CCL2 and CCL7), and cell growth (IL-8 and IGFBP2) (Fig.  To investigate whether angiogenin plays a role in CM/E2-CM-induced angiogenesis, HUVEC cells were treated with CM or E2-CM supplemented with or without angiogenin-neutralizing antibodies. Compared with the negative control (basal medium only), the CM and E2-CM groups exhibited the same effects experienced by the positive control with respect to the promotion of HUVEC tube formation. Neutralizing angiogenin in CM and E2-CM significantly suppressed the effects of CM and E2-CM on angiogenesis with respect to total tube length and total branch points (Fig.  The key role of exosomes in CM in regulating CTX-induced POI and circadian rhythm disorders was further investigated using a 4-OOH-CP-treated human KGN granulosa cell model in vitro. The experimental groups included the control group (Control group), the groups challenged with 4-OOH-CP then treated with: MDCD201 mock medium only (Mock group), exosome-depleted conditioned medium (Exo-/CM group), exosomes only (Exo group), and conditioned medium (CM group). We assessed the protein levels of C-Casp3 and PCNA (indicators of granulosa cell apoptosis and proliferation, Fig.  ER To further identify the potential molecular exosomal factors responsible for the therapeutic efficacy, the exosomal miRNAs present in CM and E2-CM were analyzed. As shown in Supplementary Figure S6, the E2-CM group showed a significant higher exosome counts then the CM group (Fig. S6A). The overall miRNA profiles in CM and E2-CM showed that there are miRNA candidates associated with apoptosis, POI, estrogen production, circadian rhythm modulation, and estrogen-circadian rhythm interactions (Figs. S6B–F). Figure  pcMSC Exosomal miRNA Profile.  The results pertaining to the interactions between miRNAs and their target genes are presented in Table  Putative interactions between miRNAs and their targets For each target gene of interest, only the top two most abundant miRNAs with a TargetScan Context++ score of ≤ – 0.2 are included. The data in the table were sourced from TargetScan 8.0, and gene names, along with the pairing sequences between target genes and miRNAs, are highlighted in red The expression levels of potential miRNA candidates in each group were further quantified using Q-RT PCR analysis. We found that E2 priming enhances the expression of miRNAs of ER The unique biosignature of ER-expressing MSCs in repairing POI and circadian rhythm disruption was further demonstrated by comparing the exosomal miRNA profiles of ER-positive MSCs (pcMSCs) with those of ER-negative MSCs (BMMSCs, ADMSCs, and WJ-MSCs (Data were referenced from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE153752 ( The present study is the first to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the secretome derived from niche-responsive estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) human placenta–derived MSCs (ER The potential therapeutic effects of MSCs on POI have been reported in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. In addition to MSCs, CM obtained from various MSC types have been shown to effectively restore ovarian function in chemical-induced POI through various mechanisms. For example, CM derived from human umbilical cord MSCs has been demonstrated to improve the ovarian reserve of the premenopausal ovary through paracrine growth factors such as HGF, VEGF, and IGF-1 [ We found that CTX led to significant alterations in ovary size, morphology, and function, including poor folliculogenesis and low E2 levels. Specifically, pcMSCs expressed ERα to respond to the estrogen in the ovarian niche. Treatment with CM and E2-CM derived from ER Studies have reported that  We assessed the CYP19A1 and CYP11A1 protein levels in ovarian tissues at ZT8 and ZT4, and our results indicate that CM and E2-CM treatment effectively reversed the CTX-induced suppression of CYP19A1 and CYP11A1. Similarly, CM and E2-CM restored the CTX-induced suppression of RORA protein levels in ovarian tissues at ZT4. The expression patterns of REV-ERB The exosomal miRNAs in CM and E2-CM apparently play a key role in reversing the effects of CTX on ovarian function and circadian rhythm disruption. miRNAs have been regarded as potential targeted therapeutic drugs because of their ability to regulate mRNA expression. Researchers have used several miRNAs to treat POI in mouse models, specifically targeting the genes of primordial follicle activation ( In the present study, we demonstrated the effects of CM and E2-CM on CTX-induced apoptosis and Caspase-3 expression in granulosa cells in vivo (Fig.  Female reproductive function is regulated by under the circadian rhythms of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, which help maintain ovarian hormone secretion and a regular reproductive cycle [ Our study demonstrates the effects of CM and E2-CM on CTX-induced circadian rhythm disorder involving the clock proteins RORA, REV-ERBα, E4BP4, DBP (Fig.  The expression levels of certain miRNAs were notably elevated in both CM and E2-CM samples. Specifically, let-7a-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7i-5p, and miR-24-3p were associated with the regulation of apoptosis and estrogen synthesis, while miR-199a-5p, miR-199b-5p, miR-24-3p, and miR-191-5p were linked to the regulation of circadian rhythm. Additionally, miR-29a-3p and miR-16-5p played a role in follicle activation. These findings highlight the potential direction of miRNA therapy for POI and POI-related circadian rhythm disorder. The estrogen responding ER The coordinated time-dependent action of the HPG axis has been reported to maintain physiological hormone secretion and reproductive function in accordance with the diurnal cycle. It is directly involved in the regulation of ovarian steroid-associated genes such as  The present study is the first to demonstrate that the pcMSC secretome (with or without E2 priming) can respond to the ovarian niche and effectively restore ovarian failure and circadian rhythm disruption both in vitro and in vivo.

11468102,Three-dimensional Analysis of Facial Asymmetry in Unilateral Lambdoid Craniosynostosis,"Unilateral lambdoid synostosis (ULS) is characterized by occipital flattening, mastoid bulging, and contralateral parietal bossing. Anterior craniofacial features are less well-defined. This study utilizes volumetric, craniometric, and composite heat maps of three-dimensional (3D) rendered CT scans to analyze anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS and compared to controls. A retrospective review of three-dimensional CT scans. Tertiary care pediatric institution. 30 ULS and 30 control patients. Volumetric and craniometric analysis of the anterior fossa, orbits, zygomas, maxilla, and mandible was performed. The anterior fossa volume was greater bilaterally (0.047, 0.038), and the fossa angle was more anterior contralaterally (<0.001) and more anterior bilaterally than controls (0.038, 0.033). The orbits had greater height and lesser depth bilaterally compared to controls (0.006, 0.009; < 0.001, < 0.001). Zygoma length was significantly greater on the contralateral side than controls (0.048; < 0.001). Nasal contralateral deviation of 3.57  ±  1.97°. The maxillary length was longer on the contralateral side (0.045). The mandibular angle was more anterior on the ipsilateral side and posterior on the contralateral side (<0.001) compared to controls (0.042, < 0.001). Chin had a contralateral deviation of 1.04  ±  3.74°. ULS has significant asymmetry in the anterior craniofacial skeleton. There is a bilateral expansion of the anterior cranial fossa with greater frontal bossing on the contralateral side. Increased orbital height and decreased depth. Contralateral zygomatic and mandibular body lengthening with posterior mandibular deviation. These features may provide more effective diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies.","Unilateral lambdoid synostosis is the least common form of single suture craniosynostosis, accounting for only 1 to 4% of all cases. Most of the morphometric studies evaluating unilateral lambdoid synostosis have primarily focused on alterations in the middle and posterior cranial vault; a few small studies have begun to describe some of the anterior craniofacial features. Previously, the laterality of frontal bossing had been used in the differentiation of synostosis and deformational plagiocephaly. Features of facial asymmetry appear to persist following surgery; therefore, it is worthwhile to perform a comprehensive analysis to understand better the complex anterior deformational changes in this rare condition. Retrospective CT scan analysis of 30 patients diagnosed with ULS following institutional review board approval by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All CT images were obtained pre-operatively, and no patient with a synostosis-related syndrome, positional plagiocephaly, or any other craniofacial malformation was included. An additional 30 age- and gender-matched control subjects’ images without pathological findings were analyzed for comparison. The average age of the ULS group was 1.84  ±  2.25 years and the control group were 1.85  ±  2.24 years. In both groups 16 were male and 14 were female. Right sided laterality was present in 17 patients and left sided in 13. Metopic ridge was present in 13 patients. CT images were converted to three-dimensional skeletal models using Mimics 22.0 (Materialise, Belgium) and then analyzed using 3-Matic 15.0 (Materialise, Belgium). Volumetric data was collected from 3-Matic 15.0 (Materialise, Belgium). The anterior fossa volume was separated by tracing along the edge of the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone to the edge of the cranial vault. The anterior fossa was further split into left, and right-sided volumes separated by a plane through the anterior nasal spine and sella turcica ( Volumetric segmentation of the orbit, zygoma, mandible, and anterior cranial fossa. The three-dimensional rendered skeletal models were analyzed by measuring various craniometric distances and angles. The anterior fossa angle was measured between the mid-sagittal plane and the lesser wing of the sphenoid ( Orbital landmarks (top left), zygomatic measures (top right), zygomatic angle (bottom left), and nasal deviation (bottom right). Maxillary angle (top left), mandibular lengths (top right), mandibular angle (bottom left), and chin deviation (bottom right). Heat maps demonstrating areas of difference between composites of right sided unilateral lambdoid and control patients. Warmer colored areas representing projection and cooler colored areas representing retrusion. Composite (average) heads were calculated using previously described mathematical models. All craniometric distances and angles were collected in triplicate. The average value and standard deviation were then calculated. Two different authors collected the measurements independently and then averaged their values. Measurements were obtained in an unblinded fashion but were corroborated with blinded analysis. Statistical analysis between groups was performed using two-sample unpaired student t-tests with statistical significance considered a value of  The anterior intracranial volume distribution is shown in  Upper, Middle, and Lower Facial Third Measurements (Mean  ±  STD). (*) Statistical significance. The results of the orbital measurements are shown in  The maxillary angles were not significantly different between sides and compared to control. Mandibular volume was not significantly different shown in  Heat maps created from overlaid right sided ULS and control patient group composites are shown in  Premature closure of the lambdoid suture profoundly affects skull growth, resulting in significant asymmetry of the cranial base, calvarium, and facial skeleton. Although many of the characteristic deformities in ULS are well documented in the literature, previous studies have primarily focused on calvarium and cranial base morphological changes. The current study provides a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS patients, employing a combination of volumetric, craniometric, and composite heat map analysis using preoperative three-dimensional rendered CT scans. This approach allows for a more detailed and accurate assessment of the anterior craniofacial features in ULS patients than previously reported. The relatively large cohort of 30 patients enables us to draw more robust conclusions regarding anterior craniofacial asymmetry in ULS patients. These novel findings enhance our understanding of this rare condition's complex anterior deformational changes, ultimately informing more effective diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies. Reports of anterior cranial morphology in ULS have been inconsistent in previous studies and have described ipsilateral and contralateral frontal bossing cases. While orbital dysmorphology is a documented feature in craniosynostosis of other major sutures, particularly metopic and coronal synostosis, this has not previously been described in lambdoid synostosis. When examining the midfacial structures, the zygoma length was significantly longer on the contralateral side compared to the ipsilateral side. This indicates midface protrusion on the contralateral side of the face in ULS patients. This had previously been theorized by Smartt et al., who speculated that anterior displacement of the mandible on the ipsilateral side might coincide with anterior displacement of the midface and lengthening of the zygoma on the contralateral side. The results of the lower facial analysis are consistent with the findings of previous studies and demonstrate that mandibular angles at the articular fossa were all increased on the contralateral side, which appears to reflect a posterior shift of the cranial base on the contralateral side. Notably, 43% (13 out of 30) of our patients with ULS exhibited visible metopic ridging on skeletal CT images. Benign metopic ridge is thought to be present in 10-25% of infants as a variant of normal, which raises the question if the increased incidence in our study population is more than coincidental. Traditionally, surgical correction for ULS has focused on reshaping the posterior cranium. Depending on the patient's age, this may involve endoscopic strip craniectomy or open posterior cranial vault remodeling. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex anterior craniofacial deformations in patients with ULS when planning surgical management. Although our study does not explicitly propose a surgical technique or staged procedures, our results contribute to the ongoing discussion about the most appropriate surgical management for ULS patients. By incorporating a comprehensive understanding of anterior craniofacial asymmetry into the decision-making process, clinicians can develop more targeted and individualized treatment plans that address each patient's specific needs. Future research should focus on evaluating the outcomes of various surgical approaches in the context of these findings. Unilateral lambdoid synostosis results in a significant asymmetry in the anterior craniofacial skeleton. There is compensatory contralateral superior and midface protrusion found with frontal bossing and increased zygomatic protrusion. Orbital height expansion with decreased depth. There exists midline deviation toward the contralateral side in both the nose and the chin. In the lower third the ipsilateral side has increased protrusion in the mandible and in the body length. An increased incidence of the benign metopic ridge was also observed in our cohort. These findings in the anterior cranium, orbits, midface, and mandible should be considered for diagnosis and potential clinical management strategies.","['craniosynostosis', 'craniofacial morphology', 'facial morphology']",2023-5-17,The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal,STD
11468025,Transfusion burden and willingness to pay for temporary alleviation of anemia status in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients in China,"Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) is one of the global public health concerns highlighted by the World Health Organization. Patients with TDT require regular blood transfusion to survive. However, the availability of blood resources is extremely limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate transfusion burden and willingness to pay (WTP) for temporary remission of anemia status among patients with TDT and to explore the associated factors. Adult patients with TDT were recruited through cluster sampling across several high-incidence provinces in China. Consenting patients completed online questionnaires on demographic information, transfusion burden and WTP with real-time WeChat communication assistance from researchers. The guiding techniques of double-bounded dichotomous choices and open-ended questions in the contingent valuation method (CVM) were used to obtain participants’ WTP for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. WTP calculations were performed using maximum likelihood estimation, with further insights gained through subgroup analysis based on gender, family monthly income level and convenience of blood transfusion. The analysis included 149 TDT patients from five high-incidence provinces, with an average monthly income of $198.5. Patients received an average of 3.7 units per transfusion, 15.4 times annually, with an average WTP of $70.4 per unit (95% CI [62.0, 78.9]). Estimated WTP for temporary anemia alleviation per transfusion totaled $260.6, exceeding monthly income by 1.32 times. Higher WTP was observed among males, higher-income households, and those with at least junior education. Lower WTP was noted among patients with lower transfusion volumes and those needing to travel for transfusion or during hospitalization for blood transfusion. High WTP indicated a strong desire for temporary anemia relief. Most TDT patients faced significant economic and transfusion burden. The evident gap in meeting clinical needed underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments to reduce transfusion dependency, potentially transforming TDT care and improving socioeconomic well-being and clinical outcomes. These findings supported evidence-based decision-making for TDT pharmacoeconomics and efficient healthcare resource allocation in China. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11547-2. 
 In China, patients generally had low economic levels and faced high transfusion burden and severe challenges in obtaining transfusion. They received an average of 1.4 blood transfusions per month. In addition, 25.5% of patients did not receive regular transfusion, and 91.9% experienced delayed transfusions. Chinese transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) patients, aiming to temporarily alleviate anemic conditions, were willing to pay up to RMB 513.5 (USD 70.4) for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. This finding may provide valuable insights for future health economic studies focused on TDT. Male gender, higher household income, and education beyond junior high school were correlated with higher WTP. Additionally, patients with lower single-transfusion volumes and more convenience of blood transfusion exhibited higher WTP. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12913-024-11547-2.","β-thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder marked by ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia of varying severity, the overall prevalence is 2.21% in China [ China’s blood supply has faced a'tight balance,' with shortages that are seasonal, structural, and regional. The red blood cell distribution rate per thousand people, a measure of blood institutions’ clinical supply capacity, stood significantly lower than the global average, at 11.1 donations per thousand in 2020 and 3.4 milliliters of red blood cells per capita [ In China, blood is not a commodity. It is collected by blood stations, which are non-profit organizations, and used exclusively for clinical purposes without any trade. Since 2005, a uniform national fee for blood has been in place, with a standard charge of RMB 220 for 200 milliliters. This regulation significantly ensured the safety of blood transfusions. However, the blood price may not reflect its true value. If the price of blood was the sole criterion, the monetary value of blood for patients could be underestimated, potentially impacting the development of innovative technologies aimed at reducing transfusion burden. Standardized blood transfusion and chelation therapy were major challenges for many developing countries and represent major and unsustainable health burden [ WTP elicitation methods are crucial techniques for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of CVM assessment [ The data were collected from adult TDT patient samples in five high-prevalence provinces in China [ In this study, “anemia status” referred to the state in which patients exhibited anemia symptoms and required blood transfusions for life sustenance. To clarify this concept for participants, the questionnaire was developed with insights from six leading hematologists across China, who concurred that blood transfusion is pivotal for temporary relief from anemia—a concept easily understood by patients as essential for their health. Therefore, the measurement of the willingness of TDT patients to pay for a unit of blood was chosen, reflecting their willingness to temporarily alleviate anemia. The pilot survey confirmed that patients had a positive understanding of the questionnaire. As the payment unit for WTP, this study focused on 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted suspended red blood cells due to: (1) the recommendation in the 2022 Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia, which prescribed these cells for TDT patients unless autoimmune hemolytic anemia necessitates washed red cells [ This study designed a questionnaire, which was composed of two sections (as detailed in the Supplementary File). The first section encompassed 44 items, concentrating on patient demographics and the burden of transfusion. In this section, the part on blood transfusion treatment-related information comprised details such as the number of units transfused in a single session, the frequency of annual transfusions, the need for hospitalization, experiences with anemia, and chelation therapy. This section was designed to gather information about the patient’s transfusion history and aided in the recollection of the transfusion experiences. It also aimed to facilitate patients’ mental engagement with the treatment scenario, enhancing their comprehension of the subsequent sections related to WTP. The second section of the questionnaire focused on the WTP. CVM was used to examine TDT patients’ WTP for temporarily alleviating anemia status. The formal survey employed the double-bounded dichotomous choices based on the predetermined bids which were determined by the pre-survey using open-ended questions. In the scenario where blood transfusion offered temporary relief from anemia and no other temporary relief was available, interviewees answered two rounds of questions to assess their acceptance of the bid for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. The term ‘bid’ referred to the proposed price that participants were asked to consider in their WTP evaluations. If respondents answered ‘yes’ to the initial bid (Bid The dichotomous choice method. Bid To explore the WTP of patients under ideal conditions, this study examined patients’ WTP under conditions both with and without economic constraints. Except for the consideration of economic limitations, the descriptions for the two scenarios were otherwise identical. This required participants to provide answers for both scenarios at each set of bids. Eligible participants were those diagnosed with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and willing to participate. Exclusion criteria encompassed the inability to independently complete the questionnaire due to health or cognitive impairments and those prescribed washed red blood cells for transfusion. Given the rare nature of this disease and the lack of incidence data across provinces in China, coupled with their typically close communication with medical institutions due to the need for long-term transfusions, a convenience sampling approach was adopted. Furthermore, a snowball sampling method was utilized to identify additional participants, which involved asking patients to post recruitment notices in WeChat groups, thereby expanding the sample size to 149 patients. The local hospital hematology department directors explained the nature and purpose of the investigation. Patients who consented to participate were then contacted by trained investigators through WeChat. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data for the questionnaire were collected using the WJX platform (www.wjx.cn). The survey instrument, developed by the research team in Chinese, was subjected to a thorough evaluation process. This involved consultation with six hematology department directors from major tertiary hospitals and four health economics professors. Experts provided recommendations for refining the guided scenarios and minimizing interpretive ambiguity in the questions. After two rounds of revision, all experts deemed the questionnaire to have satisfactory validity and reliability. A pilot survey was then conducted with 20 patients to assess the questionnaire’s rationality, understandability, and readability. Following this survey, researchers conducted one-on-one interviews with participants to ensure accurate comprehension of the questionnaire items. Subsequently, the study conducted both a pre-survey and a formal survey. The surveys were administered by three interviewers who had undergone two days of training and were familiar with the questionnaire, under the supervision of two public health experts. Consistency and completeness checks were performed after the questionnaire was submitted. Mean, variance and frequency were used for descriptive statistics.

 Patients’ WTP in pre-survey RMB 589 (SD = 1123) [USD 81(SD = 154)] RMB 658 (SD = 1111) [USD 90 (SD = 152)]  The bids, as detailed in Table  Design of bids Twenty TDT patients, with an average age of 26.2 years (SD = 6.5), participated in the pre-survey. Among these participants, 55% were male. Appendix  Formal survey questionnaires were obtained from 149 TDT patients across five provinces in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hunan and Guizhou. The patients had an average age of 26.2 years (SD = 9.0), and 31.5% of them were students. Most patients (78.5%) had an educational background below a bachelor’s degree. A total of 28.2% of patients were unemployed or without employment, 46.3% of the patients had no income at all, and 85.2% of the patients had a monthly per capita family income below RMB 5,000 (USD 685.9). Excluding students, the personal income of other patients was RMB 1979.9 (SD = 1601.7), equivalent to USD 271.6 (The exchange rate on November 13, 2023, was 1 USD = 7.29 RMB). Patients’ self-perceived health status was classified into four levels: “poor,” “fair,” “good,” and “excellent”. Of these, 77.2% of patients rated their health status as “poor” or “fair”. Regarding the current transfusion situation, patients had an average transfusion burden of 3.7 units per single blood transfusion (SD = 1.2) and an annual transfusion frequency of 15.4 times (SD = 11.2). In terms of transfusion history, 25.5% self-reported that they did not receive regular or adequate transfusions, and 28.9% received transfusions in different locations, taking an average of 2.5 days per transfusion including pre and post transfusion. A total of 75.2% of the patients required hospitalization for blood transfusions, 76% of whom mentioned complex admission procedures Delayed transfusions were reported by 91.9% of patients, with the longest delays averaging 41.3 days (median 30 days). Hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 9 g/dl were observed in 67.1% of participants, and 36.2% perceived a timely blood supply as inadequate. Moreover, 83.9% of patients experienced insufficient blood supply during a single transfusion. Symptoms reported included weakness (65.1%), delayed growth (37.6%), and heart failure signs (10.1%). Patients underwent iron monitoring every 4.3 months, on average (SD = 4.5). Deferasirox was the most commonly used iron chelator (59.7%), followed by deferoxamine (26.2%). Patient details are presented in Table  
 Basic patient information and transfusion burden Following randomization, 74 patients participated in the survey for the first set of bidding scenarios, and 75 patients engaged with the second set. Table  
 Patient response statistics  Considering their own economic circumstances, TDT patients had an average WTP of RMB 513.5 per unit of leukocyte-depleted suspended red blood cells (95% CI [452.0-575.0], equivalent to USD 70.4). Furthermore, the study endeavored to assess patients’ WTP without considering economic levels. Consequently, the average WTP reported by patients was RMB 1,104.1 (95% CI [931.5-1276.7]), equivalent to USD 151.5. See Table  Estimates of WTP ¥513.5 ($70.4) 31.4 (4.3) ¥1104.1 ($151.5) 88.1 (12.1) To explore the determinants of WTP for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells, the basic model incorporated all possible factors (variable definitions in Appendix  
 Expanded model results *** The subgroup analysis results are presented in Table  Results of subgroup analysis The results of the gender subgroup analysis indicated that male patients showed a higher WTP than female patients. Female patients were willing to pay RMB 444.8 per unit of blood (95% CI [373.0-516.5]), equivalent to USD 61.0, while male patients were willing to pay RMB 580.5 per unit of blood (95% CI [480.2-680.8]), equivalent to USD 79.6. The monthly household income subgroup analysis revealed that, in general, patients with higher monthly household incomes expressed a higher WTP per unit of blood. Specifically, patients with monthly per capita incomes at or below RMB 3,000 were willing to pay RMB 448.2 per unit of blood (95% CI [365.4-531.2]), equivalent to USD 61.5. And those with incomes between RMB 3,001–5,000 were willing to pay RMB 465.1 (95% CI [379.1-551.2]), equivalent to USD 63.8. Patients with incomes of RMB 5,001 or above presented the highest WTP at RMB 906.0. (95% CI [686.0-1126.0]), equivalent to USD 124.3. The convenience of blood transfusion subgroup analyses revealed that patients with less convenient access to blood transfusion demonstrated a higher WTP. In this study, convenience of blood transfusion was measured by whether hospitalization was required and whether blood transfusion needed to be performed in a different location. The WTP for patients with convenient access to blood transfusion was RMB 529.4 (95% CI [458.3-600.6]), equivalent to USD 72.6. In contrast, the WTP for patients with inconvenient access to blood transfusion was RMB 457.4 (95% CI [339.4-575.3]), equivalent to USD 62.7. This study investigated transfusion burden and WTP for temporary relief from anemia among adult TDT patients in high-prevalence areas by analyzing factors influencing WTP. From the results, it was clear that patients place a high value on anemia relief, regardless of their financial situation, indicating a significant WTP for health improvements. Patient gender, age, household income, and the number of units transfused in a single session were also associated with their WTP. Adult TDT patients, frequently of lower socioeconomic status, bore a considerable disease-related financial strain, predominantly due to the increasing costs of clinical transfusion and iron chelation therapy with age [ Furthermore, the hospital admission process, necessitating navigation across multiple departments, was cited as onerous by numerous respondents, significantly consuming time and energy. Moreover, in light of blood shortages, some hospitals enforced strict criteria, requiring patients to exhibit low hemoglobin levels or additional medical complications to qualify for inpatient blood transfusions. Thus, the standardization of clinical blood management protocols could markedly alleviate the burden associated with transfusion. Even though patients had a low economic status, they consistently faced high disease burden. Their WTP for temporary relief from anemia was still high, and their actual payment willingness may be higher due to costs beyond the blood itself. On average, each patient received 3.7 units of blood per transfusion session, with an annual average of 15.4 transfusion sessions. The WTP of RMB 1,900 (USD 260.6) for survival in a single session and RMB 29,259 (USD 4,013.6) annually for temporary relief from anemia could be roughly calculated. However, a single transfusion involves more than just the value of the blood itself. It also includes various costs, such as pretransfusion tests to prevent immunological reactions, medical equipment costs, hospitalization costs, and iron chelation costs. This study found that elderly and higher-income patients exhibited a higher WTP, consistent with previous research [ The amount of blood transfusion and its convenience also influence patients’ WTP. Patients who required a greater number of units of blood in a single transfusion session expressed a lower WTP. The increase in the number of blood transfusion units led to higher economic burden. Consequently, patients may reduce their WTP for each unit of blood due to concerns about the high medical costs. Additionally, as the volume of transfused blood increases, the marginal health benefits per unit of blood may diminish, resulting in a decreased WTP among patients. Patients with more convenient blood transfusions exhibited a higher WTP. This could be attributed to the fact that the convenience of blood transfusions may enhance psychological comfort and reduce anxiety associated with the procedure, thereby increasing WTP. Furthermore, convenient transfusion conditions may save patients additional costs such as transportation, examination, and cost of hospitalization, thus potentially increasing their WTP for blood. These findings suggested that when formulating medical policies and blood transfusion services, it was necessary to consider the economic status and needs of different patient groups. To improve the accessibility and equity of medical services, more support and subsidies may be required for patient groups with weaker economic capabilities. At the same time, improving the convenience of blood transfusion services, such as by optimizing appointment processes and reducing waiting times, may also help to enhance patients’ WTP. This study was the first to investigate patients’ willingness to pay for transfusions to alleviate anemic conditions. The burden of transfusion and TDT patients’ recognition of the value of health could provide data insights for future related health economic research. This study had several limitations. First, for the sake of patient understanding, this study concretized the concept of sustaining life with blood transfusion. However, in reality, the costs of temporarily alleviating their anemia status also included the costs of testing, iron chelation, etc. Blood was only the most crucial component of transfusion therapy, and it may not fully represent patients’ WTP to temporarily alleviate their anemia status. Second, due to limitations in the research conditions, this study employed online questionnaires for data collection, compared to face-to-face interviews, this method may have resulted in less accurate responses. This study investigated transfusion burden of patients and explored the WTP for temporary relief from anemia among patients from Chinese provinces with a high prevalence of TDT. The study pinpointed key determinants of WTP, notably age, gender, income, education, the convenience of blood transfusion and the number of units transfused in a single session. The results indicated that patients exhibit a high WTP for temporary relief from anemia and that thalassemia imposes significant burden of blood transfusion on patients. The evident gap in meeting clinical needs underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments that can lessen transfusion dependency, potentially transforming the care landscape for TDT, improving patients’ socioeconomic well-being, and enhancing overall clinical outcomes. This research contributed to a deeper understanding of TDT’s transfusion burden, serving as a valuable resource for pharmacoeconomic studies and informing effective healthcare resource allocation in China.

Can Multivalent Glycoconjugates Improve
upon Nature’s Design?","Multivalent interactions
between receptors and glycans play an
important role in many different biological processes, including pathogen
infection, self-recognition, and the immune response. The growth in
the number of tools and techniques toward the assembly of multivalent
glycoconjugates means it is possible to create synthetic systems that
more and more closely resemble the diversity and complexity we observe
in nature. In this Perspective we present the background to the recognition
and binding enabled by multivalent interactions in nature, and discuss
the strategies used to construct synthetic glycoconjugate equivalents.
We highlight key discoveries and the current state of the art in their
applications to glycan arrays, vaccines, and other therapeutic and
diagnostic tools, with an outlook toward some areas we believe are
of most interest for future work in this area.","Carbohydrate recognition plays a pivotal
role in many different
biological processes, including cell–cell recognition, pathogenesis
and the immune response. The mammalian cell surface is decorated with
a rich array of complex glycans tethered to membrane-bound proteins A representation
of the diversity in form and function of the glycocalyx.
a) Glycolipids, for example the glycosphingolipid sialyl Lewis x antigen
shown; b) proteoglycans, for example the mucin MUC1, displaying branched  Often these key processes of physiology
and pathology rely on interactions
with multiple copies of a displayed glycan, and this multivalent presentation
furnishes selectivity and avidity not achievable with individual (or
monovalent) interactions. The attractiveness of this precise, yet
tunable molecular recognition has led to the design of biomimetic
systems which exploit the power of multivalent glycan interactions,
for applications in drug discovery, vaccines, diagnostics, and tools
to probe fundamental biological interactions. Despite significant
progress, however, we remain far from achieving the complexity and
intricacy displayed in nature. This perspective will briefly
explore the basis of the potent,
selective yet dynamic recognition and binding enabled by multivalent
glycan presentation, and then introduce the scaffolds commonly utilized
to produce synthetic equivalents. We will highlight key examples of
synthetic systems which harness multivalent glycan interactions in
the context of developing diagnostics, designing vaccines and therapeutics,
and probing biological recognition through glycan arrays. Finally,
we will discuss the outlook for this exciting field, exploring the
key opportunities and challenges presented. It has long been established that multivalent
presentation of recognition
motifs can enable increases in affinity and avidity of recognition
events ( Representations of a) monovalent binding; b) multivalent
binding;
c) reduced enthalpy due to conformational strain associated with multivalent
binding and nonoptimized linker length; and d) impact of increasing
the effective local concentration through multivalent ligand presentation. Unlike proteins and nucleic acids, however, complex
carbohydrates
are not created using a templated biosynthesis, and confer macromolecules
with far more structural diversity, owing to their large monomer palette,
multiple attachment points that allow for branching, and variable
enzymatic modification. Lectins are proteins which
bind carbohydrates, and are often complexed
as multimers possessing several recognition sites, with the ability
to interact with multiple copies of the relevant glycan. The idea
that polydentate ligands could form more stable complexes than their
equivalent monodentate ligands (the chelate effect) is a concept that
has long been familiar to supramolecular chemists. The favorable free energy changes of multivalent binding interactions
are driven by the enthalpic and entropic contributions of linked carbohydrate
ligands with a receptor protein. A favorable binding enthalpy is driven
by networks of hydrogen bonds between the carbohydrate ring hydroxyl
groups and amino acid residues, The influence
of a previous binding event upon the enthalpy and
entropy (and therefore free energy) of a subsequent binding eventis
known as cooperativity. Cooperativity is quantified with a parameter
α, which is >1 when cooperativity is synergistic, <1 when
cooperativity is negative and interfering, and =1 when recognition
is noncooperative/additive. The classic biochemical example of positive
cooperativity is the allosteric binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, Even in systems
where subsequent binding is negatively cooperative,
multivalent systems still provide useful degrees of higher-avidity
binding. Many carbohydrate–lectin
interactions are multivalent with
respect to both the carbohydrate and the lectin recognition domain,
furnishing access to multiple binding modes. Multivalent glycoconjugates
may bind to multiple recognition sites on a single lectin, or cross-link
recognition sites on adjacent lectins. It is often difficult to deconvolute
the contribution of these distinct binding modes, particularly in
complex biological systems, yet their impacts may be profound, as
has been demonstrated by a model system exploring recognition of DC-SIGN. There are several suggested reasons
for why nature employs the
multivalent presentation of low-affinity interactions, rather than
many different, specific and high-affinity contacts. First, multivalency
provides a chance to increase binding affinity over a dynamic range,
giving a breadth of response to mono or multivalent ligands, rather
than a simple on/off switch. Finally, multivalent interactions allow for recognition events
and aggregate structures over large surface areas. For example, it
is thought they may play a role in processes such as cell–cell
signaling and tissue structure at the membrane The synthesis of multivalent systems is typically
achieved by conjugation
of an appropriately compatible glycan onto a central or core structure
suitably equipped for multiple points of glycan attachment. Robust
chemistries, such as copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition
(CuAAC), amide coupling, Michael addition and oxime or hydrazone ligation
are frequently used as attachment methods ( a) Common attachment methods for the synthesis
of multivalent glycoconjugates.
b) Classification of constructs commonly used to achieve multivalent
glycan presentation. In order to facilitate
multivalent binding, surfaces or macromolecular
scaffolds are often used to present glycans in two or three dimensions,
with a high degree of diversity in the structures used ( The presentation of multiple carbohydrate recognition motifs
on
a synthetic macromolecular scaffold also allows for the use of simplified
carbohydrate structures, A key development in the pursuit of complex
synthetic multivalent
systems was in the automated production of the glycan itself. Automated
glycan assembly (AGA) was pioneered by Seeberger in the early 2000s Chemoenzymatic synthesis, where synthetic building blocks
are assembled
or modified by enzymes, is another strategy which has pushed forward
the production of more complex glycans. Glycan arrays are a high-throughput approach
to screen glycan recognition
capabilities against target proteins or other binding partners of
interest. This technology was pioneered in the early 2000s, with the
noncovalent deposition of glycolipids onto nitrocellulose surfaces Schematics of a) typical glycan array setup for investigating
the
glycan-binding preferences of a protein of interest (POI); b) spherical
liposome-based 3D glycan array; Development of orthogonal attachment
chemistries means that sugars
can be grafted onto distinct areas of a given solid support using
a myriad of methods, including thiol–ene and tetrazine click
reactions, imine condensations, and nonspecific photolabeling strategies. Glycan arrays have aided in the discovery of many interactions
of glycans and binding proteins from viruses, One advantage of glycan arrays is the very small amount of
material
that is needed for screening (down to femtograms of glycan), and which
is printed onto slides with automated robots that can routinely print
spots with 100 μm diameters, The spacing and
orientation of glycans on a biological interface
such as the cell surface is critical for carbohydrate recognition,
in particular for multivalent binding. One interesting route to overcoming the enforced structural
presentation
of surface attachment, and to introduce equilibrium control over density
and orientation, is the modification of glycan array approaches to
incorporate fluid membranes, for example by using liposomes or lipid
bilayers. For example, by incorporating varying amounts of D-mannose-appended
glycolipids into a supported lipid bilayer, Guo and co-workers have
showed  By allowing for the free diffusion of glycans, these
membrane-based
systems can equilibrate with glycans clustered at the correct distances
and orientations for optimal multivalent binding. Separately, this
concept has also been demonstrated in supported lipid bilayers ( More recently, whole cells have been demonstrated as platforms
which may offer enhanced functionality compared to conventional glycan
arrays. This can be done in one of two ways. First, the surface expression
of glycans can be manipulated by harnessing the mammalian cell’s
own glycan synthetic machinery. While the density of glycan presentation
is more easily controlled
with the synthetic glycoconjugate scaffolds discussed here, it can
be hard to replicate the heterogeneity present in biological systems
without significant synthetic effort. By utilizing genetically engineered
and chemoenzymatically altered whole cell platforms, it is simple
to access controlled diversity in the glycans presented, although
the more granular details of binding constants or cooperativity for
individual interactions may not be possible to infer. A spectrum of
technologies is available, ranging between precisely defined systems
and fluid, whole-cell glycan arrays, and the ideal technology will
depend greatly on the application and desired information. A therapeutic application of multivalent
glycoconjugates that garners
considerable research effort is vaccine development. Glycans are generally
considered to be poorly immunogenic, failing to produce long lasting
protection, particularly in infants and the elderly. a) T-cell-independent
immune response with carbohydrates. b) T-cell-dependent
immune response using glycoconjugate. c) Semisynthetic antibacterial
vaccine developed by Gening and co-workers. A list of current FDA approved
glycoconjugate vaccines has been
compiled recently. Both semisynthetic
and fully synthetic vaccines consist of three
main components: a synthetic carbohydrate antigen, a linker and a
carrier. The Cuban vaccine, Quimi-Hib, against the pneumonia and meningitis
causing bacterium  The development of fully synthetic vaccines
also garners considerable
research effort, however no fully synthetic vaccines have been licensed. A further application of multivalent
glycoconjugates is toward
the synthesis of anticancer vaccines and immunotherapy, an area of
research that has been reviewed extensively in the past 15 years. Quimi-Hib has shown us that semisynthetic glycoconjugate vaccines
are possible. A major bottleneck in the application of semisynthetic
and fully synthetic vaccines is the large-scale synthesis of the desired
glycans through increased manufacturing complexities and higher costs,
when compared to obtaining glycans through pathogen cultivation, Multivalent glycoconjugates
are being investigated for a variety
of other therapeutic and diagnostic applications, including for lectin
inhibition, a) Antiadhesive therapies against  The macromolecular nature
of multivalent glycoconjugates typically
excludes them being considered “drug-like”, e.g., considering
Lipinski’s rules. Given the rapid acceleration in antibiotic
resistance, Multivalent glycoconjugates have also been applied to the inhibition
of carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Deficiency in the β-glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase),
which
is the underlying cause of the glycosphingolipid lysosomal storage
disorder Gaucher disease, can be counterintuitively improved by the
application of multivalent inhibitors in a technique called chaperone
therapy. Influenza A
infection is dependent on the action of two carbohydrate-binding
proteins The multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands on a macromolecular
scaffold also presents opportunities for the design of antiadhesive
agents, which act to prevent the adhesion of bacteria to cellular
surfaces in the initial stages of infection. For example, uropathogenic  Biofilm formation in  Mimicking natural structures synthetically is an important step
in the development of new therapeutics. Mucin, a densely glycosylated
polypeptide, is the primary component of mucus and provides an important
barrier for cells against microbial infections and toxins. Kiessling  Interest in the use of glyconanoparticles as diagnostic tools has
also been garnering attention. Colorimetric and fluorometric approaches to detect disease
markers
are attractive from a point-of-care context on account of their rapid
throughput, and typically high-sensitivity. With these applications
in mind, tetraphenylethylene scaffolds have been decorated with multiple
copies of carbohydrates that bind to the bacterial toxins As discussed above within
the context of glycan arrays, there is
a move toward creating biologically engineered whole-cell systems
for the specific display of multivalent glycoconjugates for therapeutic
and diagnostic applications. Early work used chemoenzymatic glycocalyx
editing to produce cells with specific glycosylation patterns, for
example using fucosyltransferase to install E-selectin ligands onto
the cell surface to enhance engraftment and trafficking of stromal
cells The progress made in complex glycan synthesis
and characterization
over the past 20 years has brought about a “golden age”
for glycobiology. Automated synthesis, chemoenzymatic methods, and
the huge diversity in scaffolds available means chemists can synthesize
multivalent carbohydrates which more and more closely approximate
the complexity and diversity seen in nature. This is complemented
by the tools that have been developed for the characterization of
complex systems, including mass spectrometry and chromatography techniques,
as well as a host of chemical biology and bioinformatics techniques
which can more accurately predict the natural systems we are seeking
to emulate. With these tools and techniques to hand, there remains
many challenges and opportunities for synthetic chemists to expand
our understanding of glycobiology. Heteromultivalent systems
present an area which deserves increased
attention, both for our fundamental understanding of interactions
with the glycocalyx in nature, and for the benefit of therapeutic
and diagnostic design. There is evidence to suggest that secondary
binding effects could have different entropic and enthalpic contributions
than their corresponding homomultivalent systems, The fluid, three-dimensional presentation of
a glycan within a
dynamic surface is a factor deserving increased consideration in the
design of multivalent systems. Multivalent interactions occur over
large surface areas, and the glycocalyx is thought to regulate membrane
shape by exerting forces that bend the plasma membrane in high-density
regions, Finally,
multivalency produces opportunity for aggregates as proteins
and multivalent glycans interact with one another through networks.
There is evidence that multivalent ligands and receptors can aggregate
and become kinetically trapped as a result of a phase transition. The ability to synthesize
mimics of the multivalent glycoconjugates
we see in nature affords the potential to understand their behavior
on a fundamental level. Further to these examples, there will be a
plethora of new biological questions, as well as applications in diagnostics
and therapeutics, which are fertile ground for synthetic chemists
who can increasingly make systems that reproduce the complexity and
diversity seen in nature.",[],2024-09-28,Journal of the American Chemical Society,STD
11467826,Comparison of urine protein–creatinine ratio and urine dipstick test for significant proteinuria in preeclamptic women,"Assessing for significant proteinuria in pregnancy (SPIP) stands as a key indicator for diagnosing preeclampsia. However, the initial method typically employed for this assessment, the urine dipstick test, often yields inaccurate results. While a 24-h urine collection is considered the most reliable test, its implementation can lead to delays in diagnosis, potentially affecting both maternal and fetal well-being. The urine protein–creatinine (P/Cr) ratio can be used as an alternative to 24-h urine protein analysis, but its diagnostic accuracy has remained uncertain. There is a need to compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine P/Cr ratio and dipstick urinalysis for SPIP, especially in resource-poor settings. To determine and compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine P/Cr ratio and dipstick urinalysis in a spot urine specimen for the diagnosis of SPIP among women evaluated for preeclampsia using 24-h urine protein excretions as a gold standard. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The study involved 82 singleton pregnant women evaluated for preeclampsia from 20 weeks of gestation who underwent dipstick and P/Cr ratio tests in the same urine sample. Women at risk of preeclampsia were given a specimen container for the collection of urine samples on an outpatient basis. Participants were trained and told to collect the urine sample 24 h prior to their next antenatal appointment. However, those on admission and evaluated for preeclampsia had their 24-h urine collected in the hospital. The outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio and accuracy for the two tests. Significant proteinuria was defined as a P/Cr ratio >0.27 or ⩾2+ of proteinuria on the dipstick test. Preeclampsia was confirmed in women with both high blood pressure and SPIP. The mean age of participants was 28.65 ± 5.76 years. Comparatively, the diagnostic accuracy (91.46% (95% CI = 83.29–96.59) vs 59.76% (95% CI = 48.34–70.44),  The spot urine P/Cr has superior diagnostic accuracy in the determination of significant proteinuria in pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia than the widely used dipstick test. A more robust multicenter study is needed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of spot urine PCR with the standard 24-h urine protein in low-income settings. 
Comparison of diagnostic tests for the detection of protein in the urine of pregnant women with preeclampsia
 • Preclampsia is one of the medical disorders that can complicate pregnancy, and it is a major cause of feto-maternal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. • Preeclampsia is the development of elevated blood pressure beyond the normal value during the second half of pregnancy with a significant amount of protein in the urine. • The detection of a significant amount of protein in the urine is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia; however, there are limitations with the various methods of urine protein detection and estimation. • The study was conducted among women being evaluated for preeclampsia. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of the urine protein-creatinine ratio and dipstick urine test for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria in pregnancy using 24-hour urine protein excretions as a gold standard. • Our findings showed that the spot urine protein-creatinine ratio has superior diagnostic accuracy when compared to the regular dipstick urine tests for the detection of significant protein in the urine among pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia.","The examination of urine for the presence of protein constitutes an important part of detecting people with preeclampsia. Traditionally, significant proteinuria (0.3 g/24 h) has been diagnosed through the collection of a 24-h urine sample, and this remains the widely recognized gold standard for the diagnosis of significant proteinuria. Due to the above shortfalls in 24-h urine collection, other methods are being proposed, which include the use of a urine dipstick, urine collection over shorter periods (2, 4, 8 or 12 h) and urine protein–creatinine (P/Cr) ratio. The dipstick is cheap, does not require much technical input and gives an instant result; however, studies show that it has low sensitivity and specificity when compared with the gold standard test. The protein–creatinine (Pr/Cr) ratio is superior to 24-h urine protein measurement, as stated by the UK Chronic Kidney Disease guideline. Medical disorders in pregnancy associated with significant proteinuria may increase adverse outcomes for the pregnant woman and her baby; therefore, the importance of an accurate assessment of SPIP cannot be overemphasized. Significant proteinuria in pregnancy may be seen in conditions such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension and renal disease. Preeclampsia remains a significant cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A lack of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) specific to glomerular foot processes (podocytes) is linked to kidney impairment in preeclampsia. fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), a soluble VEGF receptor, is expressed at higher levels in hypoxic placentas in patients with preclampsia (PE). In the end, sFlt-1 disrupts the filtration barrier and causes proteinuria by preventing VEGF from attaching to its receptor on endothelial cells and podocytes, leading to damage to the podocytes and glomeruloendotheliosis. Most of the previous studies on this have used only subjects in Western or Asian countries. There is a paucity of studies in our environment on the comparison of the P/Cr ratio and the urine dipstick test for significant proteinuria in preeclamptic women. Therefore, this research is undertaken to determine and compare the P/Cr ratio and dipstick test in a spot urine sample for accuracy in detecting the presence of SPIP against 24-h urine protein estimation for the diagnosis of preeclampsia. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The reporting of this study conforms to the Standard for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement. This study was conducted at the obstetrics and gynaecology unit of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH) in Nnewi, Nigeria, between March and September 2020. The study participants were pregnant women at risk and evaluated for preeclampsia that presented to the antenatal clinic and labour ward unit of NAUTH, Nnewi, Nigeria. Those included in the study were all pregnant women with raised blood pressure diagnosed from 20 weeks of the index pregnancy, pregnant women with ⩾1+ of proteinuria on routine urinalysis from 20 weeks gestational age and pregnant or intrapartum women with a history of convulsion. The exclusion criteria were as follows: women diagnosed with hypertension and/or renal disease before pregnancy; pregnancy less than 20 weeks of gestation; pregnant women with a history of recurrent infection of the urinary tract; participants with concurrent clinical and laboratory evidence (bacteriuria) of urinary tract infection, molar pregnancy, or multiple pregnancies; and women who delivered before the completion of 24-h urine collection. The minimum sample size required for the study was calculated using Fisher’s formula. Documented, informed consent was obtained from all participating women. Women at risk of preeclampsia were given a specimen container for the collection of urine samples on an outpatient basis. They were told to collect the urine sample 24 h prior to their antenatal visit. However, those admitted to the hospital and evaluated for preeclampsia had their 24-h urine collection done on an inpatient basis. A container tagged with the patient’s full name and identification number was used to collect the specimen. Thorough washing of the hands with soap and water was done, and the hands were dried with a paper towel. The cap of the specimen container was removed, and care was taken to avoid touching the inside of the cap or the inside of the container. The cap was then placed on the table with the inside of the cap facing up. A sterile wipe was opened, and the patient was taught (by a female research assistant) to separate the labial folds covering the urinary opening with fingers and clean inside using one sterile wipe, moving from the front to the back. One side was cleaned and discarded, and then, with a new sterile wipe, the centre was cleaned and also discarded. The other side was finally cleaned with a new sterile wipe. The participant urinated into the toilet while still parting the urinary opening. The specimen container was introduced into the urine stream until it was half-filled with a mid-stream specimen. The cap was placed back on the container without touching the inside of the cap or the inside of the container. Every drop of urine during the 24-h period was collected, and it was started in the morning after emptying the bladder upon waking up from sleep. The time of starting was recorded. Urine was collected into the sample container and stored at room temperature. Urine was also collected at the time of defecation; care was taken to avoid fecal contamination. It was concluded the next morning after collecting the first urine. A midstream specimen of urine was provided by the participant in a 10-ml sterile container. The test was conducted immediately by dipping the strip into the urine sample, ensuring that the coloured reagent part was completely immersed in urine. The test strip was placed flat on a paper towel and read after 60 s by holding the strip against the container to compare the standardized chart with the sample strip. The result was recorded, and the strip was discarded. The dipstick test was performed by the researcher at any time of the day that the participant was seen, using N-Multistix SG-L, manufactured by Siemens Health Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. This Multistix container was colour-coded such that 1+ protein = 30 mg per 100 ml and 2+ protein = 100 mg per 100 ml. The research assistants were blinded to the clinical status of the participants. The estimation of protein and creatinine content in the urine sample was done using the colorimetric method. The sample was run as soon as it was collected. Boric acid was added as a preservative. In situations where the test cannot be done within 2 h after voiding, the sample is refrigerated immediately and then allowed to return to room temperature before the test is performed. Microbial multiplication in unpreserved urine at room temperature may lead to protein loss. Samples were stored at 0–8°C for a week or at 20°C for a month without significant effect on test results. Proteinuria was measured by the quantitative method Creatinine was measured by the quantitative method The protein concentration was divided by the creatinine concentration in mg per 100 ml. Significant proteinuria is a protein concentration greater than or equal to 300 mg in a 24-h urine specimen, greater than or equal to 2++ on a dipstick in a random mid-stream urine sample or a P/Cr (mg/mg) threshold of >0.27. Hypertension was defined as the presence of systolic blood pressure ⩾140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ⩾90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 h apart. Women who have hypertension and SPIP occurring after 20 weeks of gestation are classified as having preeclampsia. The outcome measures were the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio, and accuracy of the urine dipstick method and spot urine P/Cr in the diagnosis of SPIP in women evaluated for preeclampsia. The data were checked for completeness and tabulated. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were presented in tables and charts, while continuous data were presented in mean and standard deviation. As shown in previous studies, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios and accuracy for the P/Cr ratio versus dipstick test were calculated. The study was done over 7 months from March 2020 to September 2020. In all, 97 pregnant women with new-onset elevated blood pressure diagnosed in the second half of the index pregnancy were assessed for eligibility. Eleven of the subjects were excluded. Seven out of the 11 had chronic hypertension, while the remaining four developed hypertension before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Out of the 86 women who were recruited into the study, 82 (95.3%) women completed the study and were analysed, while four women delivered before the completion of 24-h urine collection and were further excluded. The flow chart for this study is shown in  Flow chart of the study. Participants’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

SPIP, significant proteinuria in pregnancy. The motivation for this study was that accurate examination of urine for the presence of protein constitutes a very important aspect of care to detect people with preeclampsia and its complications. Prompt and accurate diagnosis may contribute significantly to reducing the adverse effects of this condition in pregnancy. The principal finding of the present study was that the spot P/Cr ratio has higher diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio than the dipstick test. However, the negative likelihood ratio for the dipstick test was expectedly higher than the spot P/Cr ratio. The spot P/Cr ratio showed a better correlation with 24-h urine protein measurement than the dipstick test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy. Previous studies have reported varying degrees of accuracy and sensitivities for the dipstick urinalysis. Ebeigbe et al. The present study also showed that the spot P/Cr ratio had a higher sensitivity and specificity value when compared to the dipstick test. These results are comparable to those reported by Ebeigbe et al., who showed a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 88.5% for the spot P/Cr ratio. Ebeigbe et al. The present study also demonstrated that there was no relationship between the spot P/Cr ratio and the dipstick test. This could be the result of some mechanisms. For instance, the production of creatinine is constant for every individual, and it depends on the muscle mass of that individual, unlike the excretion of protein in the urine, which depends on the degree of endothelial damage to the kidneys. However, in a prospective observational study done by Baba et al., Contrary to predictive test values, likelihood ratios are less subject to variations in the presence of a disease in a given population. A likelihood ratio greater than 1 indicates that the test result is associated with the presence of the disease, whereas a likelihood ratio less than 1 indicates that the test result is associated with the absence of the disease. The further likelihood ratios are from 1, the stronger the evidence for the presence or absence of the disease. Likelihood ratios above 10 and below 0.1 are considered to provide strong evidence to rule in or rule out diagnosis, respectively, in most circumstances. In this study, the sub-group analysis of women at pre-term gestation compared to term gestation showed that the majority of the participants had preterm delivery. This shows that a greater burden of the disease, in terms of fetal morbidity and mortality, results from complications of preterm birth. The clinical implications of the findings could be very fascinating; for instance, the dipstick test could be described as cheap, easy to perform, does not require technical expertise and gives an instant result. On the other hand, P/Cr ratio tests are more expensive and require technical expertise and trained laboratory personnel when compared to dipstick urinalysis. The P/Cr ratio test result could be available within 30 min (though longer than the dipstick test time), but it is still timely to make a definitive diagnosis and institute appropriate treatment. Though the P/Cr ratio test may be more expensive, its benefits in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy far outweigh the drawback of cost because the consequences of misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions are far-reaching. The strength of this study lies in the fact that our study provided updated information on the accuracy of the spot P/Cr ratio test compared to the urine dipstick test for evaluating significant proteinuria. However, the limitation of the study was that we could not determine the accuracy of the test with respect to the severity of preeclampsia. Also, the study is a single-centre study; hence, it is difficult to generalize our findings; hence, a multicentre, large sample size study is necessary to strengthen or refute our findings. In future studies, factors such as differences in the detection thresholds, variability in test conditions or patient heterogeneity should be evaluated to determine its significant contribution in the interpretation of findings. In this study, the spot P/Cr ratio, a hospital-based test, has superior sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in the determination of significant proteinuria in pregnant women being evaluated for preeclampsia than the widely used protein dipstick tests. There was no correlation between the protein dipstick test and the spot P/Cr ratio test for the detection of significant proteinuria in pregnancy. While the dipstick test may at best be used as a screening tool because of the cost/convenience, there may be a need for universal adoption of the spot P/Cr ratio test for the confirmation of significant proteinuria in pregnancy in women evaluated for preeclampsia in this setting.","['hypertension', 'preeclampsia', 'protein/creatinine ratio', 'proteinuria', 'significant proteinuria in pregnancy']",2024-10-9,Therapeutic Advances in Reproductive Health,STD
11467576,Diagnosis of ophthalmologic diseases in canines based on images using neural networks for image segmentation,"The primary challenge in diagnosing ocular diseases in canines based on images lies in developing an accurate and reliable machine learning method capable of effectively segmenting and diagnosing these conditions through image analysis. Addressing this challenge, the study focuses on developing and rigorously evaluating a machine learning model for diagnosing ocular diseases in canines, employing the U-Net neural network architecture as a foundational element of this investigation. Through this extensive evaluation, the authors identified a model that exhibited good reliability, achieving prediction scores with an Intersection over Union (IoU) exceeding 80 %, as measured by the Jaccard index. The research methodology encompassed a systematic exploration of various neural network backbones (VGG, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet) and the U-Net model, combined with an extensive model selection process and an in-depth analysis of a custom training dataset consisting of historical images of different medical symptoms and diseases in dog eyes. The results indicate a fairly high degree of accuracy in the segmentation and diagnosis of ocular diseases in canines, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. In conclusion, this potentially makes a significant contribution to the field by utilizing advanced machine-learning techniques to develop image-based diagnostic routines in veterinary ophthalmology. This model's successful development and validation offer a promising new tool for veterinarians and pet owners, enhancing early disease detection and improving health outcomes for canine patients.","The purpose of this research was to explore the possibility of developing efficient software models that will be able to provide fast screening for eye abnormalities in canines solely by examining an image taken by a smartphone or single camera under various conditions. Using the developed model, pet owners may have a unique opportunity to detect early development of eye diseases in their pets and seek timely veterinary help. Furthermore, such tools may also provide rapid screening capabilities for veterinarians allowing them to quickly initiate medical treatment or facilitate a referral to the veterinary ophthalmologist, dramatically improving the quality of the veterinary care for patients with eye diseases. To develop the precise and reliable diagnostic success of software tools, it is crucial to construct a precise and robust model based on expert knowledge [ Symbolic representation and general anatomic localization of clinical symptoms - corneal edema (a), episcleral congestion (b), epiphora (c), and Cherry Eye disease (d). Corneal edema  As already mentioned, all the above clinical symptoms and diseases can be early clinical signs of vision-threatening ocular diseases, and their early detection and recognition may provide a unique opportunity for timely veterinary intervention and prevention of more serious complications. The main contributions and novelties of this manuscript are the following. A novel dataset of eye clinical symptoms and diseases with images containing close-ups of ocular structures, annotated and prepared for supervised machine learning. Extension of U-Net architecture for image segmentation composed with the backbone of deep convolutional neural networks VGG16, ResNet34, Inception V3, and EfficientNet B3 with extensive performance comparison. Influence analysis of the selected loss functions (Categorical cross-entropy loss, Dice loss, and Focal loss) in the U-Net segmentation architecture for the canine eye symptoms segmentation. A novel U-Net model with Res-Net34 backbone for pixel-based automatic localization of clinical symptoms and recognition of eye diseases in dogs with detailed statistical analysis. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: A summary of the research about the popular machine learning techniques used in medical-related imagery for humans and pets closely related to ophthalmology is provided in Section  The field of ophthalmology has increasingly integrated the advances of computer vision over the past decade, leveraging its capabilities to enhance the classification and diagnosis of eye diseases [ Despite the broad application of these technologies in human ophthalmology, the exploration into canine ocular diseases has been relatively limited [ The first convolution networks were used for classification tasks only [ Object detection (a) vs. image (instance) segmentation (b). For our modeling, we first needed to detect the eye to localize the area of interest in the image, and then segment the eye image so that we can more precisely mark the area of the eye that is affected by a disease. For this reason, we chose artificial neural networks that are typically used to classify images, localize objects, and extract features from images, such as edges or corners, namely convolutional networks. These networks use convolution operations to process the input data allowing them to handle large amounts of image data and video. We also chose to research the methods that showed the best results on segmentation tasks on benchmark data sets, so in the research, we decided to investigate the possibility of applying and adapting the U-Net architecture and its variants in our tasks. Given that there is no available data that could be used to train models for automatic canine eye disease detection, we had to build a dataset that includes segmentation of eye regions with clinical symptoms and classification into the appropriate class. To build and annotate the database, we used original images and expert knowledge from a board of certified veterinary ophthalmologists. It is known that the training of most neural networks will be more successful if many thousands of labeled training samples are used, which is difficult to ensure when creating a customized database for special purposes such as our case. However, experiences and trends have shown that deep neural networks, including U-Net, can be successfully trained with much fewer images, using methods of knowledge transfer and data augmentation [ To be able to learn a machine learning model for the detection and segmentation of the eye area, as well as for all tasks of supervised machine learning, it is necessary to have an appropriate data set prepared in such a way that the model can be trained on it and a set on which the model will be evaluated and tested. When defining an appropriate data set, it is necessary to collect appropriate images, preprocess them, and prepare them for the appropriate machine-learning tasks for which the model will be trained. In the field of medical and veterinary image analysis, we used expert annotations to associate a diagnosis label to images for the task of image classification and recognition of eye disease diagnoses, then labeling with a bounding box the object (eye) in the image and associating the corresponding label that includes the corresponding diagnosis and coloring the eye region for image segmentation. Careful selection of the learning set, i.e. a quality data set, is key to developing a model that aims to help define diagnoses with relevant and useable suggestions. Many publicly available datasets are designed specifically for a certain purpose, but none involve the detection or segmentation of the eye, especially not the eye of a dog or cat, nor the detection of disease states. The size of benchmark datasets varies from a couple of MB to a few TB and can be applied in classification, object detection, semantics, and instance segmentation. The Pascal VOC dataset [ The MS COCO dataset [ The open Images dataset [ The ImageNet dataset [ We built our original custom dataset DogEyeSeg4: Dog Eye Segmentation 4-Class Ophthalmological Disease [ Some of the images were taken from the Atlas of Veterinary Eye Diseases [ For each image, a corresponding single-channel mask of the same dimensions as the original image is created that includes segmented image regions corresponding to a particular medical symptom or eye disease. There are 4 classes plus the background in the set, which are displayed in such a way that different pixel intensities represent different classes as shown in  The input image examples, column (c1), with the corresponding masks column (c2). The masks are colored to better distinguish between classes. The dataset exhibits a well-balanced distribution among the different classes, as can be observed in  Distribution of Data Classes in the Dataset. The number represents the recurrence of certain diseases in images. To enhance the robustness and effectiveness of our model, we implemented data augmentation techniques. Drawing from the insights of previous research in the domain of medical imaging, particularly referencing the U-Net approach [ In a separate context, those exploring polyp segmentation [ Affine augmentations: Original image (a), horizontal flip (b), horizontal shift (c), rotation (d), and vertical shift (e). The bottom line of our augmentation methodology lies in its ability to diversify the dataset, making it more representative of different viewing angles during image capture, all the while preserving the integrity of the underlying symptoms. This approach aligns with a scientific and rigorous manner of data manipulation, ensuring that the augmentations serve as a surrogate for changes in camera position, without altering the essential clinical characteristics of the eye conditions under study. Transfer learning is a widely used technique in computer vision that allows the use of patterns previously learned on other problems and data sets with little tweaking, on another data set to learn models of interest instead of starting the learning process from scratch. Namely, CNNs in their layers can learn different features on images, e.g.: initial network layers learn low-level features such as lines, points, curves, and the like, layers in the middle of the network learn objects built on top of low-level features while high-level layers can include high-level features based on the features of previous layers. Of course, the more similar the data sets are, the better results can be expected. It has been shown transfer learning achieves as good results as learning from scratch but with significantly less time and computer resources [ Also, thanks to transfer learning more complicated CNN architectures can solve more complex computer vision tasks, so we can build an architecture e.g. object detection or image segmentation on top of another CNN that was originally trained for image classification, we just need to discard the fully connected layers that are intended for classification. In this case, we use CNN as a feature extractor, which is a key part of the model for object detection and segmentation. The networks that are used to extract features in more complicated models and that process the input data into a representation of a particular feature are called the backbone. Many popular CNN architectures can be used as backbone networks, and we have included in our research: VGG (Visual Geometry Group Very Deep Convolutional Network) [ Those networks that we used to extract features work well as stand-alone networks on simpler classification tasks, and we have used their already pre-trained models on large data sets such as the ImageNet dataset [ The pre-trained models, initially developed on the extensive and varied datasets serve as a strong foundation for their adaptability to specific tasks on the custom ophthalmology dataset. This custom dataset is carefully constructed to be used in eye disease detection; tailoring domain-specific features built on the rich knowledge gained from ImageNet. Through a process of fine-tuning, these models were trained to provide the best possible results in the specific area of ophthalmic image segmentation for our research. This fine-tuning involved adjusting model parameters and training strategies to match the unique characteristics and challenges presented by ophthalmic images. As a result, the models are finely calibrated to detect and diagnose eye diseases with high accuracy. To incorporate pre-trained model weights into U-Net architecture it was essential to prepare images to an expected input of the desired model. The desired model is applied to a coder part of the U-Net structure and feature maps are concatenated in the same manner as when the U-Net base model is applied to a decoder segment. This way U-Net becomes the structure that is held by a CNN backbone of one's choice. Further, different backbones used in these experiments will be described along with the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The fully convolutional neural network VGG, which was proposed in 2015, was designed to reduce the number of parameters in the convolution layers and thus reduce the training time. Compared to AlexNet [ The architecture of a VGG-16 deep convolutional neural network. With each layer in CNN, the complexity of model functions increases. The weights of CNN, such as VGG are computed through the backpropagation. Due to backpropagation the gradient loss closely related to the weights is calculated in each layer and reverted through the network. With each multiplication or convolution of small weights, the gradients get considerably smaller in earlier layers, which can result in a significant increase in the training time. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem and considerably affects the performance of CNN [ The architecture of the ResNet18 deep convolutional neural network. In certain cases, objects in focus appear in different sizes and this is proven to be difficult to detect, especially if the dataset doesn't consist of different scale object presentations [ The architecture of Inception V3 deep convolutional neural network. The last CNN used in this research, called EfficientNet, tries to efficiently use the knowledge gathered from the previously introduced CNN-s. The architecture of the net is carefully designed to give better results with fewer parameters. As an example, EfficientNet B1 is 7.6x smaller and 5.7x faster than ResNet152 [ The architecture of EfficientNet B0 deep convolutional neural network. The pre-trained model depends on the usability of the dataset used for training. U-Net is an image segmentation architecture that was developed primarily for medical image analysis [ The encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that downsamples the input image and extracts features at different levels of abstraction. It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers. The base U-Net [ The bridge connects the encoder and decoder. It combines the features from the deepest layer of the encoder with the features from the shallowest layer of the decoder. By doing so it allows the network to propagate contextual information from the encoder to the decoder. This is essential for accurate segmentation. The decoder is also a CNN, but it up-samples the feature maps from the encoder and combines them with features from the encoder at different levels of abstraction. The decoder consists of a series of up sampling and convolutional layers. As before the base U-Net CNN has a 2x2 transpose convolution layer in each up-sampling layer and a kernel size of 3x3 which uses the ReLU activation function. The decoder up-samples the feature maps from the encoder by a factor of 2 at each stage. This means that the final output of the decoder has the same spatial resolution as the input image. The following algorithm diagram  Algorithm explaining the process of getting predicted segmentation masks from training images with corresponding masks describing ground truth. Once the model is trained, it can be used to segment new images by predicting the probability of each pixel belonging to each class. The class with the highest probability is then assigned to each pixel. A visual representation of the algorithm can be seen in  Basic U-Net architecture. The arrows represent convolution, ReLu, max-pooling, and crop-concatenation. Blue boxes feature maps at each layer and gray cropped feature maps from the contracting path. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) The upgraded U-Net model utilized in this study combines the strengths of different backbones, employing a feature extraction at various abstraction levels, like the structure depicted in  Improved base U-Net model with backbone where each encoder block downscales input image and extract features which are then combined with decoder blocks up-sampled feature maps at different levels of abstraction. The purpose of the activation function in CNN-s is to calculate and convert the weighted sum of the neuron to a non-linear output. The most used activation functions and the ones used in the scope of this research are ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit) [ Activation functions from left to right: ReLu (a), Sigmoid (b), SoftMax (c). ReLu is often used in hidden layers of CNN.  It avoids vanishing gradient, and it is simpler than sigmoid activation functions and therefore it requires less computation resources. Its main disadvantage is shown to be for the activations in the part of the domain less than 0 causing dead neurons. Some derivatives avoid such behavior, such as Leaky and Parametric ReLu but cause other problems [ The sigmoid activation function has an output from 0 to 1 and because it is not zero-centered it raises the problem of vanishing gradient which results in great computation time consumption.  Its main advantages are simplicity and applicability to be used as a classifier. In image segmentation, it is widely used for binary classification. For the multiple classification SoftMax activation function is used rather than Sigmoid. SoftMax as shown in  When activation functions are applied for multiple classifications, SoftMax's probabilities sum to a value of 1 which is not the case with a Sigmoid's probabilities. Sigmoid's class probabilities are independent of one another because Sigmoid treats each neural node output value separately. In SoftMax, where probabilities depend on each other, one probability value will decrease in favor of a more probable class. SoftMax for this reason is easier to implement as it gives a vector as an output from which a class can be easily extracted using Argmax. The evaluation metric is used to measure the quality of the trained model to determine its usefulness. There are many different evaluation metrics available to assess a model. Choosing the right one has a great impact on the training and testing and therefore on acceptance of the same. To justly compare models, the same metric must be used. Some metrics are more applicable to image classification than to image segmentation and vice versa. Precision is one of those. It is the simplest and most effective metric but due to class imbalance, it is shown to be extremely inefficient. The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) are the most used in region detection metrics. In image segmentation the IoU, as the name suggests, takes two regions of interest, and measures the similarity between them by dividing the region which overlaps with a region of both regions united. If there are no intersecting pixels the IoU value will be zero but if there are some the IoU score will rise to the value of 1 in case regions overlap one another entirely. The IoU metric is simple and easy to implement once the regions are classified as shown in  Implementation of Jaccard index (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) using a confusion matrix. The way IoU and DSC are calculated is very similar where their score is always within a factor of 2 as seen in  They are also always positively correlated, meaning that if one of classifiers is better under one metric it will also be better using another metric as well. The difference between metrics is visible when the average score over a set of inferences is taken. This can be observed by quantifying how much worse one classifier is over another. IoU leans towards punishing bad classifiers’ single instances more than DSC does. Consequently, DSC leans toward measuring a bad classifier closer to average whereas the IoU tends to measure the score of a bad classifier closer to the extreme. This can have an impact on the final decision like in an example where most of the inferences are slightly better by one classifier and just a small number are drastically worse by the same classifier. In that case, those two metrics may differ in judgment on which classifier to prefer. In this research average scores of both metrics were used to prevent misclassification. Loss functions are mathematical formulations that analyze deviations of the predictions and the ground truth values. A greater loss value indicates the model is more prone to errors whereas a lesser loss suggests the model's predictions are more accurate. The main objective of loss function application is loss reduction. The way this is achieved is by affecting trainable parameters, for instance, biases and weights. There are many loss functions available today and each of them has its ways of rewarding and penalizing the model's accuracy and errors respectively. Some are more applicable to the model on which this research is focused than others, which is why it is important to choose the one that will provide the best results. One of the loss functions used in this research is the Dice loss (DL) function. It is based on the DSC metric, which essentially measures the overlap between two sample areas of an image. The mathematical  DL comes in a range from 0 to 1, where DL leaning towards 1 indicates bad classifier and DL leaning towards 0, which is the desirable outcome, points to a perfect classifier. DSC can be expressed using precision telling how accurate positive predictions are and recall which describes coverage of actual positive samples. Both precision and recall in a good classifier will lean towards 1. The mathematical presentation of precision and recall, as seen in  F1-score is a harmonic means of precision and recall. The harmonic mean will always give the lowest value of precision and recall and by doing so it will penalize the lowest score. By maximizing F1-score both precision and recall will raise in value while staying balanced. To transform the discrete function of DL to calculate probabilities in the range from 0 to 1,  Cross entropy (CE) loss function is another loss function used in this research and it's widely acceptable in the scientific community for its simplicity and positive training results. It measures the difference between two probability distributions rather than overlaying between areas like DL for a specified arbitrary set of events. When used in statistics, entropy refers to the measurement of disorder providing info about the number of ways a system can be arranged. A higher entropy value means higher disorder. CE stands for the sum of all entropies of all the probability predictions. The CE is also known as a Binary CE (BCE) since it's used in the classification of only two classes.  A Categorical CE (CCE) that consists of multiple BCEs is used in multi-class cases, and the  CE loss is focused on minimizing pixel-related error, but in class-imbalanced cases, this leads to over concertation on larger objects, which as a result, lowers the segmentation performance of smaller objects. To improve performance on hard-to-detect objects CCE can be extended to Focal loss function (FL). FL concentrates more on the objects that are wrongly predicted than on the objects that were correctly predicted with high confidence by making sure that predictions on hard examples get better in time. This is achieved by downweighing as described by authors in Ref. [ The BCE can be presented in  For building models, along the U-Net base model, U-Net with four different backbones was used. ResNet34; Inception V3; VGG16; EfficientNet B3. Selection was based on popularity and benefits explained in the previous section along with publicly available pre-trained weights for quicker and better convergence. Particular versions of each backbone were hand-picked after initial experiments considering the speed-accuracy ratio. A learning rate of 0.0001 with a fixed batch size of 16 images, optimized with Adam optimizer for 100 Epoch was used across all models. Four different loss functions were used. Categorical cross-entropy loss – CCE, Dice loss – DL, Focal loss – FL, Balanced Dice and Focal loss function - DL + FL. The training was done using the original dataset in combination with augmented images. The dataset was divided between test and training in a ratio of 1:9 by random selection of images. All models were developed in Python with libraries compatible with Keras and TensorFlow frameworks. The training part was performed on the Windows platform using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 12 GB RAM and the testing part was made using Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1603 v4 @ 2.80 GHz. Models were trained in sequence on the same hardware using the same datasets to maintain the fairness of evaluation. During training, loss, and IoU values were observed. Metrics used to evaluate the performance of models are IoU and F-score equally distributed with a threshold of 50 %. The models with the highest score during each of the 100 epochs were chosen and preserved for further evaluation. The progress of training loss is shown in  The example of average training loss (a) and IOU (b) values for 100 epochs. Trained models can be divided into U-Net base model and 4 groups where each group is trained using based U-Net and with a different backbone. Each group can be subdivided into 4 different models based on loss function as can be seen in  Segmentation  Average test time is computed as approximation of time needed for the segmentation of 20 images on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1603 v4 @ 2.80 GHz. Average train time is time needed for training on full dataset using NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 12 GB RAM. The results clearly show that the use of a more complex model that includes U-Net and backbone models was a very good strategy that contributed in most cases to a significant improvement in segmentation and classification results. Regardless of which type of backbone network is used and which loss function is used in model training, significantly better results than the original U-net network were achieved for all classes except for the Cherry eye class. This can be related to the insufficient data for that class which was not sufficient to adjust the EfficientNet network parameter, and the overly simple VGG backbone network which failed to extract relevant and discriminative features for Cherry eye. The U-Net + ResNet34 model using DL + FL loss has the overall highest score for two out of 4 classes according to the Jaccard coefficient measure. When exclusively employing the Dice loss within the U-Net + ResNet34 model, performance, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, demonstrates a significant improvement of the Epiphora class compared to other models. U-Net + Inception V3 has the best score for the Corneal Edema class with a Jaccard index of 78.3 %. The difference between the best and worst performing models in cases where the background class is disregarded is 27 %. Both are from the model with the same backbone. This is also an example of the highest improvement using different loss functions. If the least detectable class is not considered – Epiphora class, the average score of all models improves up to over 13 %. The models based on U-Net + VGG16 are shown to be the quickest in the segmentation of test images. Further experiments were performed on all models using DL + FL functions which gave the best results according to  Cross-validation using dataset folds in a ratio of 80:20. Notably, in this part of the experiment, the background was considered as first class. This consideration of the background class significantly contributes to the overall improvement in model performance, as background segmentation accuracy is usually particularly high. The results of the cross-validation are shown in  Results of a 5-fold cross-validation with a Jaccard index coefficient in percentage as a reference with background class included. Since we could not compare the models trained on our image database for segmentation and classification of eye diseases with the reference results because they simply do not exist, we analyzed the results with statistical tests ANOVA [ Prior to further statistical analyses we conducted a QQ-Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot) for Standardized Residuals to assess the normality of the data distribution since the normal distribution of residuals is a common assumption in ANOVA [ The QQ-Plot visually compares the distribution of standardized residuals from our data to a theoretically normal distribution. Ideally, for the residuals to be considered normally distributed, the plot's points should align closely with the 45-degree reference line. In our analysis, the points from the QQ-Plot demonstrated a satisfactory alignment with this line, indicating that the assumptions of normality are reasonably met. The QQ-plot following our research is shown in  Shows a QQ-plot, comparing the standardized residuals of a model to a theoretical normal distribution. The data aligns with the expected normal line, with minimal tailing observed, indicating a generally normal distribution of residuals. Based on the results obtained from the QQ-Plot analysis, which suggested that our data distribution adheres to the normality assumption, we proceeded with a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the impact of the proposed network architecture modifications on the segmentation results. ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more samples to understand if at least one sample mean is significantly different from the others due to a specific factor. In this case, we compare the means of the five samples where factor is the architecture modification, and the samples are the Jaccard index coefficient from each fold. The null hypothesis asserts that all group means are equivalent, while the alternative hypothesis suggests that at least one group differs significantly. To compute the p-value, we conducted the ANOVA test [ The next step, Between-Group Variance, involves calculating how much the group means deviates from the overall mean of all samples combined. This metric reflects the variance resulting from the differences in network architectures. After Between-Group Variance, Within-Group Variance is calculated. Here, the variability of individual group samples around their respective group means is assessed. This variance measures the characteristic variation in segmentation performance within the same network architecture across different folds. By dividing the between-group variance by the within-group variance the F-value is calculated. A higher F-value suggests a greater degree of difference among group means relative to the variation within groups. Finally, the p-value is derived from the F-distribution, based on the calculated F-value and the degrees of freedom associated with the between-group and within-group variances. The p-value indicates the probability of observing the calculated level of variation among group means if the null hypothesis were true. A p-value less than 0.05 is a widely accepted standard indicating that the observed data would be quite unlikely under the null hypothesis, suggesting a real effect or difference between the groups tested. In our case, the calculated p-value of 5.294·10 The Tukey HSD test is a widely endorsed method for this purpose, allowing for multiple pairwise comparisons while controlling for the family-wise error rate. This test is particularly useful in situations where multiple comparison tests are required, as it adjusts the p-values to account for the fact that the more tests you perform, the higher the chance of encountering a false positive. The outcome of the Tukey HSD test provides us with a means to rigorously compare each model against the others, returning pairwise significance levels and confidence intervals for the difference in means. These statistical tools guide us in determining which architectural enhancements to the U-Net model yield a statistically reliable improvement in segmentation performance. The analysis, again, was performed using the Jaccard Index as the primary metric for evaluating model performance ( Comparison of models using Jaccard Index based on different architectures with combination of Dice and Focal Loss using Tukey HSD test showing p-value for each pair combination. In this comparative analysis, we specifically focused on how modifications to the U-Net architecture influence its segmentation accuracy, with a use of Jaccard Index. The p-values reported by the Tukey HSD test, as shown in  The comparisons within the enhanced U-Net models reveal varying degrees of performance impact. The match between U-Net + ResNet34 against U-Net + Inception V3 with resulting p-value of 0.013 and U-Net + VGG16 with p-value of 0.001 shows significant performance differences, highlighting a robust performance distinction. However, the comparison between U-Net + ResNet34 and U-Net + EfficientNet B3 yields a p-value of 0.046, situating it at the border of statistical significance. This suggests a meaningful but less distinct contrast in their performance, indicating that while different, the performance improvements from ResNet34 and EfficientNet B3 are closer than with others. Worth mentioning, the comparison between U-Net + Inception V3 and U-Net + EfficientNet B3, with a p-value of 0.9, suggests no significant difference in their performance enhancements. This outcome implies that both architectural modifications offer comparable benefits. Additionally, the near-significant p-value of 0.09 for U-Net + Inception V3 versus U-Net + VGG16 indicates a slight but not statistically significant difference in performance, suggesting their potential equivalence in effectiveness. The results of statistical analysis indicate that the U-Net + ResNet34 models besides consistent well performance, significantly differ from other models based on the different architecture, therefore further experiments will include U-Net + ResNet34 model alone. U-Net + ResNet34 models showed the best segmentation and classification performances on our image database. In  5-fold cross-validation results of U-Net + ResNet34 models based on the Jaccard and Dice Index. The best results are marked in bold, and average in bold italic. In addition, Precision, Recall, and Pixel Accuracy were evaluated, which provides a comprehensive understanding of model performance, as shown in  Precision, Recall, and Pixel Accuracy evaluation of cross-validation models. The best results are marked in bold. Average results are written in bold italic. In  Confusion matrix of U-Net + ResNet34 Cross-Validation Model 2. A confusion matrix provides a practical way to compare a model's performance across different classes, especially when there's an imbalance in the number of pixels belonging to each class. The background has very high precision and it has less than 1 % FP in favor of Corneal Edema. Epiphora class has the best performance with only 3 % belonging to the Epiphora class but being classified wrongly as belonging to the Background. Other classes have fewer pixels classified correctly and are only confused with the background. Zeroes implies that the model does not confuse samples originally belonging to disease class with each other, i.e. the classification boundary between disease classes was learned well by the model. The Cherry Eye prediction outcomes should be the focus for enhancing this model's performance. The classifier misclassified 30 % of samples which is the highest misclassification rate of all the classes. This pattern suggests difficulties in differentiating Cherry Eye from the background, potentially due to texture and color similarities. It's important to note that the confusion matrix in  In  Segmentation of test images containing closeup of an eye with diagnosis. The left column (c1) shows original images, the middle column (c2) shows ground truth (GT) and the right column (c3) predictions. The upper row (r1) predicts two classes as ground truth, the middle row (r2) fails to detect Epiphora class, and the lower row (r3) falsely detects another instance of Episcleral congestion. Segmentation of test images containing whole head figure with diagnosis. The left column (c1) shows original images, the middle column (c2) ground truth (GT) and the right column (c3) predictions. The upper row (r1) predicts Cherry Eye positively and episcleral congestion falsely. The middle row (r2) makes a false detection of the corneal edema but correctly segments Cherry Eye. The lower row (r3) detects a combination of episcleral congestion and corneal edema classes where only the Cherry Eye class is present. From the resulting images of the test dataset, it is evident that the prediction model works within the scope of the expectation, providing the user with sufficient data to assist in the diagnosis of four eye conditions a pet can experience. The epiphora is the class which in general has proven to be the hardest to segment, even though U-Net + ResNet34 Cross-Validation Model 2, which was taken as an example shows otherwise, is also the most difficult to annotate due to not-so-distinguished boundaries. Considering the visual difference, when observed by the human eye, the classes that get most mixed between are the Cherry Eye and episcleral congestion. These are the ones developed models also find sometimes difficult to distinguish, especially when the observed object is small and distant. The problem that arises when the head figure or whole body is present in the image is related to false positives in regions that don't include the eye at all. Such a behavior can be prevented by focusing on an eye before starting a segmentation. The reason for the inclusion of these images in the dataset is the fact that dogs aren't always cooperative during the close-up eye image capturing. Further research could include handling mechanisms of obtaining closeup images by extracting regions with an eye and making an automatic selection of the best eye image in the image sequence. When comparing the results of models based on different backbones, datasets, and loss functions ResNet34 was demonstrated to be the optimal solution providing the best results in the majority of tests. Considering the time of test prediction execution, which is in close relation to complexity and resource requirements, in combination with other scores U-Net + ResNet34 was superior for the analysis of dataset from this study. Only base U-Net and U-Net + VGG16 have a faster response but at the considerable cost of a prediction score. Slightly better segmentation results of corneal edema have U-Net + Inception V3 which can be assumed is caused by better segmentation of images with a variable size of the cornea. The potential model improvement could be achieved by combining various backbones to keep practicality as the major priority. The background should be discarded in average scores. The decision to exclude the background class from average scores warrants further elaboration. In this image segmentation study, it became evident that including the background class in our evaluation metrics did not significantly contribute to the practical insights gained from the model. The primary reason for discarding the background class in our average scores is twofold. Firstly, background pixels typically dominate the majority of images in the dataset, resulting in a disproportionately large share of the evaluation. However, these background regions often do not contain meaningful information related to the specific eye conditions under investigation. As a result, their inclusion would unduly influence the overall segmentation scores without providing valuable insights into the model's ability to differentiate between the classes of interest. Secondly, the study focuses on the accurate identification and segmentation of specific eye conditions in canines, a task that necessitates precise recognition of pathological features within the images. In most cases, the background class does not offer relevant information for the diagnostic process. Therefore, considering the high values achieved in the absence of the background class, its inclusion would not only deceive the observer but also complicate the interpretation of the model's performance on the classes of actual clinical interest. In essence, the exclusion of the background class from our average scores aligns with the study's primary objective, which is to assess the model's performance in identifying and segmenting Corneal Edema, Episcleral Congestion, Epiphora, and Cherry Eye. By doing so, the aim is to provide a more focused and accurate evaluation of the model's practicality and effectiveness in the domain of veterinary ophthalmology. By removing the background class from our average scores, we ensure that evaluation metrics provide a clear and meaningful reflection of the model's ability to address the specific challenges presented by canine ocular diseases. This deliberate choice emphasizes commitment to a balanced and informative assessment of the model's diagnostic capabilities. The Jaccard and Dice Index are used as the main evaluation over other metrics such as Recall and Precision considering segmentation evaluation best practice [ The decision to use a combination of DL and FL gave better results than using FL, DL, or CCE alone. The choice to combine DL and FL, rather than employing each loss function individually, stemmed from the unique advantages they bring. Dice Loss, known for its ability to handle class imbalance effectively, excels in providing precise segmentation results. Focal Loss, on the other hand, prioritizes challenging examples during training, contributing to better convergence and performance in the presence of abundant easy examples. This combination effectively balanced the trade-off between high-precision segmentation and the ability to tackle complex cases. While the alternative strategy of combining FL and CCE was not specifically tested in this study, it can be reasonably assumed that the joined benefits of DL and FL would outperform using FL alone or in conjunction with CCE. This is due to the similarity in objectives between FL and CCE, with FL enhancing the concepts of CCE. The inclusion of an additional 25 % of augmented images in the dataset proved to be a successful strategy in this research. By doing so, the dataset was extended to an optimal number of images based on [ During the training process, it is apparent that all models were converging as expected by continued lowering of the loss and an increase of IoU. It can be speculated that further training could result in better performance, but it would require significant resources, which might not be justified. It would take significantly more training to achieve just a mild improvement. Since the goal of this study was to make the model widely applicable, further research will be oriented toward making it more practical and easily applicable on mobile devices. The final model should strive to be a tradeoff between accuracy and accessibility. Acknowledging the limitations and weaknesses of our study enriches its context and guides future research directions. The current dataset, though informative, could be enhanced by increasing its size and diversity with more classes, potentially improving model generalization. Incorporating attention mechanisms might also refine the results by focusing on relevant features. However, dataset expansion is challenging due to the extensive expert hours required for accurate annotation. Experimenting with a broader range of models and continuously enriching the dataset with more classes and images would likely enhance performance, despite the significant effort and time investment involved. Additionally, exploring advanced data analysis techniques could unveil deeper insights, further advancing the study's contributions. Our model, originally designed for a canine eye disease, was applied to a human eye segmentation dataset – Open Eye Dataset (OpenEDS) [ Notably, the absence of parallel research efforts specifically addressing canine eye segmentation highlights the innovative application of this model. The minor practical difference in mIoU relative to the challenge's top entry suggests the possible further model refinement, especially with a specific segmentation task in mind. Despite the model's origination for diagnosing canine eye diseases, its competitive performance in a human eye segmentation challenge illustrates its broader applicability and underscores the potential for cross-species diagnostic tools. While there is a limited supply of datasets and study dedicated to segmenting the human eyes for numerous reasons, corresponding datasets and studies focusing on canine subjects are virtually nonexistent. The scarcity of comparable studies, especially in the segmentation of canine ocular diseases, highlights the unique contribution of this research and its potential impact on the field. Based on the research results, we suggest further exploration and development of the U-Net + ResNet34 model. This proposed model is designed for the recognition and pixel-based localization of clinical symptoms and canine eye diseases, with a primary focus on achieving the highest Intersection-over-union (IoU) scores for individual and combined classes. The adjustments made to enhance robustness and practicality aim to facilitate effective decision-making for non-specialized veterinary applications. In the domain of veterinary ophthalmology, this research embodies both promise and challenge. The author's machine learning model for diagnosing ocular diseases in canines indicates precision and accessibility, redefining the boundaries of diagnostic capability. The model's diagnostic accuracy is essential to this achievement, reflected in Intersection over Union (IoU) scores that surpass 80 % for a particular class. It empowers veterinarians and pet owners with a dependable, user-friendly tool for the early detection of ocular diseases. This decentralization of diagnosis paves the way for improved treatment outcomes, which will eventually promote the well-being of canine patients. Acknowledging these leaps, it is vital to confront the inherent constraints that frame this study. The dataset, while carefully assembled, remains but a fragment of the expansive clinical landscape. Therefore, as in computer vision tasks, the pursuit of larger and more diverse datasets is imperative to augment the model's generalizability. Furthermore, the specter of subjectivity in data interpretation, despite expert oversight, may benefit from collaboration with a panel of specialists to mitigate individual bias. The exploration of alternative hyperparameter configurations remains pivotal for enhancing the model's precision and robustness. A notable constraint comes in the form of scalability. The dataset needs updating and rebalancing with each new disease that justifies inclusion. This task proves complex, as diseases occur with varying frequencies, potentially making dataset maintenance an ongoing challenge. Real-world application and seamless integration into clinical settings represent uncharted terrain. Bridging the gap between model development and practical deployment remains a focal point. Simultaneously, the constant need for vigilance is required by ethical and privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with legal and moral standards. The path ahead offers numerous avenues for refinement. Collaboration with Specialists: Engaging a panel of veterinary experts further elevates data interpretation and model calibration. Hyperparameter Exploration: Exhaustive hyperparameter exploration can result in more precise and adaptable models. Real-World Integration: Integration into clinical systems and real-world deployment demands exploration. Ethical and Regulatory Adherence: Ongoing commitment to ethical and regulatory compliance is imperative. In sum, this research embodies a juncture where technology converges with veterinary practice, elevating the skill of ocular disease diagnosis. In this context, benefits, limitations, and the path ahead converge to extend the reach and influence of veterinary ophthalmology. The Dog Eye Segmentation 4-Class Ophthalmic Disease (DogEyeSeg4) Dataset: URN:NBN: HR:195:405214 associated with the submitted journal article is publicly available for further research at the [ The images included in the dataset were collected as part of routine clinical evaluations conducted by a veterinary ophthalmology specialist. For the purposes of this study, images were selected randomly and anonymized, ensuring that no examination dates, client information, or animal identifiers were included.

11467404,A flexible and fast digital twin for RRAM systems applied for training resilient neural networks,"Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) has gained considerable momentum due to its non-volatility and energy efficiency. Material and device scientists have been proposing novel material stacks that can mimic the “ideal memristor” which can deliver performance, energy efficiency, reliability and accuracy. However, designing RRAM-based systems is challenging. Engineering a new material stack, designing a device, and experimenting takes significant time for material and device researchers. Furthermore, the acceptability of the device is ultimately decided at the system level. We see a gap here where there is a need for facilitating material and device researchers with a “push button” modeling framework that allows to evaluate the efficacy of the device at system level during early device design stages. Speed, accuracy, and adaptability are the fundamental requirements of this modelling framework. In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-like modeling framework that automatically creates RRAM device models from device measurement data. Furthermore, the model incorporates the peripheral circuit to ensure accurate energy and performance evaluations. We demonstrate the DT generation and DT usage for multiple RRAM technologies and applications and illustrate the achieved performance of our GPU implementation. We conclude with the application of our modeling approach to measurement data from two distinct fabricated devices, validating its effectiveness in a neural network processing an Electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset and incorporating Fault Aware Training (FAT).","Resistive Random-Access Memories (RRAMs) are promising due to their built-in non-volatility and since they can perform Vector-Matrix-Multiplication (VMM) of arbitrarily large inputs with constant computational complexity  Surprisingly, despite attempts to address this challenge, we found that there is a lack of models which are (a) fast to simulate, (b) accurate and (c) easy to adapt to new devices and/or programming algorithms. While various modelling approaches exist, these tend to be lacking in one or more of these criteria, hindering system-level development and - subsequently - adoption. These efforts are fundamental for RRAM research since recent research indicates that e.g. individual instances of artificial neural networks react quite differently to device variations In this work, we propose a solution to the before-mentioned challenge. We implemented an end-to-end modelling flow for the generation and usage of Digital Twins (DTs) in a fully automated manner, as depicted in Fig.  We showcase the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed model through its application to three distinct domains. Firstly, leveraging the inherent non-volatility of RRAMs, we explore their potential application as memory, where ongoing research focuses on diverse error correction approaches. Secondly, we illustrate the suitability of RRAMs for real-time applications at the Edge, particularly in tasks like Edge detection. Lastly, we investigate the suitability of two distinct different device technologies for the implementation of ANN. We derived measurement data for  This is not the first work attempting to model memristive devices, significant efforts have been spent on creating simulation environments for both memory and compute applications of memristive devices at different levels of abstraction: At the lower levels of abstraction researchers have devised atomistic To the best of the authors knowledge none of the existing works can achieve simulation speeds which are competitive with the results reported in this work while being as easy to fit to new measurement data and/or a different application domain. Furthermore, limiting RRAM models to the mere device itself lacks substantial information about the surrounding circuit, both regarding area and power draw. Subsequently, we integrated the capability to model surrounding circuitry. This approach has been used successfully to design and evaluate a RISC-V One of the key contributions of the proposed modelling technique lies within the fully automated flow from raw measurements to system-level evaluation; A new generation of RRAM devices, a different wafer or a novel programming algorithm can be modelled by pressing a single button (Fig.  Proposed approach. Generating Digital Twins from measurement data is fully automated (brown box). This can be used to create many individual Digital Twins, each covering a different variability aspect (middle). These can be integrated seamlessly in various simulation environments in order to validate a given application or system architecture (yellow box). A significant number of devices have to be characterized to adequately capture the device behavioural model. To ease this measurement phase, the  Forming voltage sweep: 2.0 V to 5.0 V using steps of 0.01 V and a pulse duration of  Reset/set voltage sweep: 0.5 V to 2.0 V using steps of 0.1 V and a pulse duration of  Read operation: A single 0.2 V pulse.

Subsequently, we derive the individual DT as follows; The percentage of stuck-at-HRS devices can be derived automatically by counting the occurrences of high-resistive (e.g. x The measurements taken for the  HRS/LRS characteristics of  This section describes key aspects of rendering the proposed model fast enough to support both large crossbars and the evaluation of large systems. The model itself is application agnostic, a given Digital Twin can be seamlessly evaluated across application domains. More details are described in the Methodology section. The fundamental concept can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the to-be-written state is selected by the application. Next, the model samples the “baseline” from the first to-be-used distribution which has been found for a given variation type (typically device-to device variation), including the mean. Further variations are added arithmetically by ignoring the mean of the corresponding distribution. The resulting energy usage (provided by the model annotations) is provided to the application. Secondly, during the read operation, the simulated resistance value is compared to the parametrized ADC, determining which digitized state this would correlate to, again providing the energy usage for the system-level evaluation. This procedure has to be repeated for each individual device. We found that this can be implemented on GPU without major data dependencies by spawning an individual CUDA thread per RRAM device. This ultimately leads to impressive overall simulation performance while only moderately taxing GPU memory (up to about  There are two fundamental approaches to integrate a digital twin containing multiple variation modules into a simulation environment. Firstly, one could sample each kind of distribution for each kind of device and each individual variation module and store the result in memory. This is advisable when a lot of operations are required since the computational complexity of retrieving the current state of the memristor is  We implemented a prototype to evaluate whether this holds for an actual simulation. We evaluated its performance by programming to  We have implemented a memory simulator using the proposed concept. A memory block is accessed randomly, setting individual RRAM devices to individual states. In order to achieve sufficient performance we ported our model to CUDA and ran it on a NVIDIA H100 GPU. The achieved equivalent simulation speed for differently sized memory blocks is depicted in Fig.  We have implemented an application which uses individual (simulated)  ( RRAM devices tend to be affected by multiple types of variability (such as e.g. device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations) simultaneously, which need to be taken into consideration for system-level evaluations. Subsequently, multiple types of device variability need to be simulated simultaneously, ultimately slowing down the achieved simulation speed. We performed multiple simulations which program  This section describes the validation of the D2D module using a separate set of data received from  Firstly, a model has been created using measurement data from a specific wafer of  The histogram drawn from these write operations on wafer b is depicted in Fig.  Our efforts to validate the usage of parallel  Results: ( Given the notable speed of the proposed model, it seamlessly integrates into widely used NN frameworks. This integration facilitates the introduction of device faults to the network during the training phase, empowering the model to enhance its resilience to such faults. While the concept itself is not new, the rapid processing capabilities of our model allow its application across NNs of varying sizes. We exemplify this by employing the model to implement FAT in an NN designed for detecting cardiovascular diseases using ECG data sourced from the “China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC)” dataset ( Within this work we have demonstrated a modelling approach which helps mitigate two crucial aspects: Firstly, it outperforms existing modelling works by multiple orders of magnitude (as a result of being fully GPU compatible). Secondly, it resembles a push-button approach to modelling, being easy to fit to new devices or individual programming algorithms. While this model cannot predict the behaviour of hypothetical devices due to the fact that it is not a physics-based model it can emulate existing devices with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have illustrated its portability by integrating it into quite different application domains. Our memory emulation benchmark achieved multiple GB/s of effective simulation speed on a HPC GPU, which - to the best of the authors knowledge - outperforms any previous work. We illustrated that this model can be ported to a CPU implementation seamlessly, allowing for the evaluation of a real-time application. Lastly, our model enabled us to apply Fault Aware Training to a neural network, allowing the training procedure to adapt to two different types of RRAM devices. More implementation details are outlined in the next section. The implemented approach is summarized in Fig.  Proposed framework: The evaluation begins with taking measurement data of RRAM devices (covering a given variation type) and combining them with circuit parametrizations to create a Digital Twin (red box). After selecting variation types (green box) these can be integrated into different applications to evaluate and/or mitigate the effects of device variations (yellow box). Lastly, the individual DT can be validated with additional measurement data (blue box). Although a materials exploration is beyond the scope of this work, we selected two different RRAM devices in order to evaluate the technological independence and flexibility of our framework. This section describes the fabrication of the two types of devices. The  The  Figure  I-V characteristics of the utilized memristive devices. The black line depicts the median of individual measurements. This section describes how to create an individual DT from raw measurement data (Fig.  Within this section we will explain how we rendered the proposed approach universal and ensured it meets performance requirements (Fig.  GPUs use the Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) approach to process many threads in parallel. A prominent example, namely ANN applications, have mostly moved to GPU processing since these provide significantly more compute capacity (about 67 TFLOP/s on a recent NVIDIA H100 Fortunately, RRAM devices are largely independent from each other, which allowed us to spawn threads without data dependencies without being bottlenecked by data transfers. Subsequently, we spawn one thread per RRAM device and spread them on the SMX units containing CUDA cores using the grid interface provided by the CUDA API. Locality effects can be covered using either the grid-thread mapping interface or by setting a cutoff distance (as typical for MD simulation frameworks) accordingly, preventing data movement bottlenecks. However, this needs to be easily accessible from an implementation-agnostic interface - the RRAM researcher should not have to deal with implementation details. Subsequently, we implemented this by initializing a PyTorch tensor per memory block accordingly and using CUDA kernels to act on them. This combination allows for eased integration into a given framework while still providing the full control of using CUDA directly. This GPU implementation can be ported to any language which is interoperable with CUDA without the need to rewrite the model itself. We used this implementation to perform a memory simulation using RRAM-blocks as storage simulating differently sized memories. This yields the performance as reported in Fig.  While a CPU is fundamentally easier to program than a GPU, creating as many threads as on a GPU is not feasible. Nevertheless, a model needs to be compatible since a lot of devices such as laptops or embedded devices might not have a dedicated GPU. Fortunately, a lot of effort has been spent on rendering CPU implementations of iterator patterns within programming languages reasonably fast We used this approach to evaluate the suitability of  The CPU needs to simulate an increasing number of crossbars while still meeting real-time requirements. Fortunately, as depicted in the performance graph in Fig.  Results: We use the DT to evaluate the suitability of  The concept of FAT has been proposed by Zahid et al. PyTorch provides the “tensor” data structure, yielding objects that can be stored and evaluated fast on a GPU. However, this proved not flexible enough to cover all aspects of RRAM models. Subsequently, we have split up our implementation into parts which can be implemented using Tensors and parts which need to be implemented with CUDA and combined them into one coherent implementation. The performance characteristics are similar to the memory simulation described earlier. This approach tries to find a middle ground: For the forward pass, the device faults are applied in a way that is similar to the quantization. To do so, a wrapper for the Digital Twin has been integrated into a custom pre/postquantizer block utilized within the custom Brevitas implementation. A matrix correlating to the stuck devices is constructed for the backward pass. Firstly, each element is initialized with ones (Eq.  As described in a previous section coupling two RRAM devices to form a single weight was neccesary when training for the  Subsequently, we applied both quantization aware training and FAT using the proposed DT approach. We configured the training procedure in such a way that device variation effects would start occuring from epoch 100.

11467093,Moss spores: overlooked airborne bioparticles in an urban environment,"Moss spores are present in aerobiological samples, but their low representation, lack of known allergenic properties, and difficult identification have led to their being overlooked by aerobiologists so far. The data about their presence in the atmosphere and the factors that influence them are, however, important from the biodiversity conservation point of view, since they give us information about their ability to spread to new habitats. In this pilot study, we analysed their presence in the atmosphere of Bratislava city, Slovakia (2018–2023), using Burkard volumetric sampler, and determined the most significant factors influencing its temporal distribution. The size category of 13–18 µm was the most represented in the samples. Environmental factors influenced the daily spore concentrations and the characteristics of the whole spore season. The start of the Main Spore Season (MSS) depended mainly on the temperatures in November–January, initiating earlier growth of sporophytes in the following year, while the intensity of the MSS was influenced by high humidity in April, stimulating the formation of spores in sporangia. The daily concentration of airborne moss spores was mostly influenced by the actual temperature and wind speed, promoting the release and dispersal of spores, and precipitation lowering their levels due to the “wash-out” effect, although no intradiurnal pattern was observed. More data from other locations is needed to determine the role of atmospheric spore transport for the conservation of moss species facing anthropogenic climatic change. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11356-024-35028-5.","Mosses (division Bryophyta) are non-vascular spore-bearing plants, consisting of some 12,000 species worldwide (Goffinet & Buck  Mosses reproduce asexually by production of vegetative propagules or fragmentation of gametophytes and sexually by meiospores which are passively dispersed in the environment predominantly by air currents (Hutsemekers et al.  The concentration of airborne moss spores depends primarily on meiospore production of the parental organisms, the mechanism of their discharge from the capsule and meteorological conditions. In general, moisture is required for the fertilization process and formation of sporophytes. Evidence of high spore production for species with small spores (7–20 μm) is evident; for instance, a single sporangium in  Despite the inaccuracy of the widely accepted statement that mosses only absorb water and nutrients together with the pollutants from the atmosphere (Varela et al.  Despite the decades-long permanent aerobiological monitoring, attention is primarily focused on pollen grains and fungal spores and information about other bioparticles in the atmosphere, including moss spores, and their spatio-temporal variability is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a pilot spatio-temporal examination of airborne moss spore occurrence within the inland temperate climate with regards to their size. Additionally, the effects of meteorological parameters and air pollutants on their levels in the air were assessed. Aerobiological samples were collected in the city of Bratislava (48°08′ N, 17°06′ E, 152 m a. s. l., 367.7 km Location of spore sampler in Bratislava. Forested areas are mainly represented by Carpathian deciduous forests The climate in the study area is temperate continental. The detailed descriptions of the weather conditions in Bratislava can be based on meteorological data from the period 2010–2023 obtained from the Bratislava–Mlynská dolina meteorological station (located 500 m apart from the aerobiological sampler). The mean annual air temperature was 11.4 °C with the highest mean monthly temperature recorded in July (22.0 °C) and the lowest in January (0.3 °C). The average precipitation is 602 mm/year with the highest rainfall in the May˗September period. Over the studied years (2018–2023), the highest mean annual temperature (12.2 °C) and precipitation (1170.9 mm) were recorded in 2023. The lowest temperature (10.8 °C) was recorded in 2021 and the lowest precipitation (830.4 mm) in 2022. Despite the relatively dry and warm climate and low altitude, 245 bryophyte taxa have been recorded in the study area (Janovicová et al.  The concentration of airborne moss spores was measured from 1 March to 30 November (275 daily samples per year) for six consecutive years (2018‒2023), using a Hirst-type volumetric aerospore trap (Burkard Manufacturing Co Ltd.). The sampler was located on the rooftop (N 48.14973, E 17.07375) at 18 m a. g. l., thus avoiding the barrier effect of urban development on airflow. At this altitude, the air is sufficiently mixed and, in addition to aeroparticles of local origin, also contains those that are remotely transported (Lacey & West  The volumetric sampler sucks in 10 l of air per minute. The air inside hits an adhesive tape placed on a rotating drum, where aeroparticles are captured on a vaseline coating. The drum revolves with a speed of 2 mm/h and turns completely in 7 days, determining the changing interval of the exposed tape. The tape was then cut into segments, each representing a daily exposure, and microscopic slides were prepared by mounting them in glycerol gelatine and staining with fuchsin. Moss spores were identified and counted along twelve vertical transects per slide, each corresponding to two hours, using a light microscope with a magnification of 400 × (Galán et al.  The Main Spore Season (MSS) was determined as the period that includes 90% of the total annual spore concentration (Annual Spore Integral – ASIn). Therefore, the MSS signifies the interval during which the cumulative sum of mean daily spore concentrations ranges from 5 to 95% of the total annual spore concentration (Nilsson & Persson  The effects of the environmental variables on moss spore concentration during the MSS in Bratislava were analysed using Poisson regression with a logarithmic link function.

On average, their MSS starts at the beginning of April (Table  Characteristics of the moss Main Spore Season in Bratislava Based on the analysis of intradiurnal variation in spore concentration over the studied years and sites, we found no significant pattern during individual hours of the day (Fig.  Intradiurnal variation in the moss spore concentration in Bratislava (2018–2023), expressed as percentages The concentration of moss spores in the atmosphere can be influenced by meteorological conditions. Analysis of the studied years showed significant differences in relative humidity in April, influencing the value of SSIn in the given year. The highest SSIn was recorded in 2023, when the mean relative humidity in April reached 81% (27% above the long-term average 1983–2023, SHMÚ), while the 44% relative humidity in April 2020 (31% below the long-term average) was followed by the lowest SSIn (Fig.  Seasonal Spore Integral (SSIn) and mean daily values of relative humidity in April in Bratislava Table  Significant environmental variables in Poisson regression model for airborne moss spore concentration in Bratislava over the Main Spore Sason, years 2018−2023 The spores of mosses, as highly efficient wind-dispersed organisms (see Patiño & Vanderpoorten  The airborne moss spores quantity depends on their size, sporangia placement above ground, the size and distribution of source populations and their proximity to the sampling equipment and meteorological conditions. During the six years, airborne moss spores were found frequently but in quite low concentration in the study area. The ASIn ranged from 124 to 367 spore*day/m In Central Europe, many mosses sporulate during the vegetation season between April and September, resulting in the highest airborne spore concentration (Stark  No intradiurnal pattern was observed in the aerobiological data, which can be explained by the heat island effect in an urban environment. The near-surface layer of the troposphere remains dynamic even during the evening and nighttime hours, thus preventing spore sedimentation in the evening (Jones & Harrison  Regarding the timing and intensity of the MSS, we noted that its start depended mainly on the temperatures in November–January preceding sporulation. Warm temperatures during these months probably initiate earlier growth of sporophytes, similar to the flowering woody plants in spring influencing the onset of their pollen seasons (Schramm et al.  The results of the statistical analysis show a dependence of airborne moss spore levels on a combination of several environmental parameters. The positive impact of temperature and wind speed and the negative impact of precipitation are similar to their influence on other airborne bioparticles, like pollen grains and fungal spores (Grinn-Gofroń & Bosiacka  CO was found to act as a potent antioxidant in plants, protecting them against oxidative damage caused by biotic and abiotic stressors (Sa et al.  We have conducted a pilot study of the presence of moss spores in the samples from the aerobiological trap in Bratislava (2018–2023). Our results show a relatively low representation of this type of bioparticles, despite their characteristics suitable for aerial transport, possibly explained by their preference for closed forest habitats from which they rarely enter free stream air transport. There are several limitations to this type of studies, since the morphological characteristics of Bryophyte spores do not enable accurate identification of genera and their low abundance in the air is an obstacle to metagenomic studies. Without proper identification, it is not possible to determine the possible differences in the responses of individual taxa to environmental factors. Cultivation of spores would be needed for correct identification, but this is not possible from aerobiological samples without some additional spore capture. Since the aerobiological trap placement can have a great role in the ratio of captured local spores to spores originating in long-distance transport, further studies with different sampler placement (including close to the ground in forested areas) are needed to learn more about the aerobiological pathway of moss spores. It is important to study the presence of Bryophyte spores in the air despite their lack of allergenic molecules (as known so far) since long-distance transport of moss spores is important for colonising new habitats in the light of the recent climatic change and anthropogenic activities impacting them with gradual loss of their preferred habitats.

We have developed resources for further studies of intracellular organelle networks, a distinct class of dynamic and distributed networks for bioinformatics research. The resources include open-access datasets of intracellular organelle networks, ER and MITO, to support the development of new deep learning segmentation models.

11466868,"Automated pipeline for denoising, missing data processing, and feature extraction for signals acquired via wearable devices in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis applications","The incorporation of health-related sensors in wearable devices has increased their use as essential monitoring tools for a wide range of clinical applications. However, the signals obtained from these devices often present challenges such as artifacts, spikes, high-frequency noise, and data gaps, which impede their direct exploitation. Additionally, clinically relevant features are not always readily available. This problem is particularly critical within the H2020 BRAINTEASER project, funded by the European Community, which aims at developing models for the progression of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using data from wearable devices. The objective of this study is to present the automated pipeline developed to process signals and extract features from the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch, which has been chosen as the primary wearable device in the BRAINTEASER project. The proposed pipeline includes a signal processing step, which applies retiming, gap-filling, and denoising algorithms to enhance the quality of the data. The feature extraction step, on the other hand, utilizes clinical partners' knowledge and feedback to select the most relevant variables for analysis. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed automated pipeline have been evaluated through pivotal beta testing sessions, which demonstrated the ability of the pipeline to improve the data quality and extract features from the data. Further clinical validation of the extracted features will be performed in the upcoming steps of the BRAINTEASER project. Developed in Python, this pipeline can be used by researchers for automated signal processing and feature extraction from wearable devices. It can also be easily adapted or modified to suit the specific requirements of different scenarios.","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are chronic conditions characterized by a progressive decline in motor and cognitive neurological functions. Although they are distinct diseases, they present similar challenges for patients and the healthcare system ( BRAINTEASER (BRinging Artificial INTelligencE home for a better cAre of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple SclERosis) (www.brainteaser.health) is a project funded by the European Horizon 2020 initiative, which aims to deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies for the daily home care of MS and ALS. In this context, AI is considered a key element in meeting the needs of both patients and clinicians. Specifically, AI methodologies can be utilized to analyze the progression of MS and ALS, allowing for the capture and handling of patients’ inter-variability, and providing tools for forecasting disease evolution ( The structure of the paper is the following. We will start by presenting the BRAINTEASER project and its aims, and the rationale behind the selection of the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch and, by exploiting the feedback received from the clinical teams in the project, we will show the procedure we applied to identify the most useful signals and features. Then, we will illustrate in detail the automated pipeline we developed to obtain signals with improved quality and extract relevant features for AI-based models employed in BRAINTEASER. Finally, we will conclude by thoroughly defining all the extracted features, and in the last section, we will present the effectiveness of the automated pipeline by evaluating the result of its application to pivotal beta testing sessions. The BRAINTEASER project aims at exploiting clinically relevant features extracted from wearable devices to feed AI-based models to monitor and predict the progression of ALS and MS chronic diseases. Before selecting the wearable device, there was the need to better understand which signals could be potentially relevant, from the clinical point of view, for the two considered diseases. Both ALS and MS have multiple degradation effects on many vital functions of patients, especially related to respiration, blood oxygenation, and fatigue. These symptoms have been studied and analyzed in recent years by many research teams, to better understand their connection with the disease and its progression. Heart rate and related features have been identified as significantly different between individuals with each respective disease and healthy subjects ( To further validate these findings with hands-on input, we asked the clinical partners of the BRAINTEASER project to provide a list of desired features to collect from the wearable device, their priority, and the ideal sampling rate. For MS, Fondazione Istituto Neurologico Nazionale Casimiro Mondino (IT) and Servicio Madrileño de Salud (ES) are the clinical partners involved in BRAINTEASER and their teams identified a very high priority for activity-related signals, such as daily steps, burnt calories, and the raw accelerometer data. They also identified the tracking of respiration rate and  The clinical input provided expert-based information for identifying the device’s requirements. Subsequently, a more technical analysis of the available devices was conducted. We focused on wrist-worn devices because of their ease of use, small impact on the patient’s life, wide availability, and ability to collect signals such as heart rate, sleep patterns, and blood oxygen concentration. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in order to identify the devices utilized in similar studies. Additionally, we thoroughly explored the manufacturer websites to obtain a more profound understanding of the capabilities and functionalities of each device. Compared wearable devices with a brief summary of the identified advantages and disadvantages. After considering all previously listed aspects, the BRAINTEASER project agreed to select the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s as the one that best fits the clinical and technical needs. The Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s (Garmin Ltd, Olathe, KS, USA) is a smartwatch that comes in two sizes and allows collecting all the signals identified in  List of health-related signals available from the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s. Of course, as discussed in  As far as the accelerometer signal is concerned, its high sampling rate would potentially lead to a high amount of data management and processing. Furthermore, its continuous collection greatly reduces the battery life to a few hours. Due to these considerations, we chose to drop this signal. However, the inclusion of accelerometer data in future studies remains relevant to these diseases. Despite the difficulties associated with its ongoing collection, it has the potential to enhance the understanding of these conditions and should be considered whenever feasible. For this project, we have chosen to use steps and calories as a proxy for physical activity information since they are readily obtainable from the device. These two specific data types represent the cumulative sum of steps performed and calories burned up to the current moment. Regarding Stress and Body battery signals, all clinical partners agreed that they would be beneficial to track. However, these signals are computed by Garmin and there is neither information nor validation on how these variables are calculated by the manufacturer, as well as no info on their clinical validity. The previous considerations led all the partners to agree on discarding these signals as well. Finally, an additional note on the  The final list of signals to be collected, analyzed, and processed with the pipeline presented in this work (see  Final list of health-related signals and the selected sampling rate exploited in the BRAINTEASER project after the device capabilities analysis and usability considerations. The AI models require as input clinically relevant features that are computed from the signals collected with the Garmin Vivoactive 4/4s and allow for a summary of the most important signal characteristics. In this section, we present the processing pipeline that has been designed and developed in Python aimed at extracting clinically relevant features.  Complete processing pipeline. It can be divided into two parts: the first three blocks are devoted to signal processing, to improve the quality of the raw data by retiming the input to a fixed sampling grid, filling data gaps, and removing noise, whereas the last block performs the extraction of clinically-relevant features. All the collected signals need to be processed before being usable for feature extraction. In our pipeline, the signal processing consists of three steps specifically tuned to deal with the characteristics of each signal. The first step is the retiming of the signal, which aims at bringing all data points to a uniform time grid. Indeed, input data might have a non-constant sampling grid and this may bias the calculation of the features. Being our final aim of feature extraction, this aspect represents a clear problem. Retiming is implemented by an algorithm that averages all input data points to the closest output grid point. In this way, the original data are preserved and only translated to the constant time grid. The average is reduced to a sum in the case of cumulative data types, such as daily calories and steps. The second step is gap-filling. Indeed, the data can have missing values, and the presence of missing values can bias the calculation of the features and any further analysis. Several strategies have been investigated to reliably fill data gaps. Since a priori information on wearable-derived data was not available, it has been decided to employ a simple but effective strategy, i.e., fill missing values by linear interpolation of nearby values. This choice is also functional since it allows performing all the feature extraction algorithms without introducing major changes in the dynamics of the wearable-derived data. It is also worth noting that there is no difference between gaps caused by the sensor itself and by non-wearing periods. The ad-hoc procedure we developed consists first of automatically identifying fillable gaps for each input signal, then filling them by linear interpolation only those whose duration is equal or inferior to the limits reported in  For each signal, the maximum time gap that allows linear interpolation is reported. Note that not all signals can be processed with the gap-filling procedure, e.g., steps and calorie signals skip the gap-filling block because of their non-continuous nature, both being aggregated samples over their sampling period. Finally, the third processing step is denoising. Due to the sensor’s characteristics, some noise overlapped with the true signal is always expected. In the case of wearable devices, this might be caused, for example, by device movement on the user’s wrist, sweating, jumps, etc., which all lead to outliers and general noise in the collected data. To improve the quality of the signals before performing the feature extraction, since no a priori information on wearable-derived data was available, we decided to adopt a very robust methodology for denoising that does not require any a priori information on the wearable-derived data, i.e., a moving average algorithm. The algorithm works by calculating the average of data points within a sliding window. This sliding window moves through the time series data, and at each position, it computes the average value of the data points within the window. This process effectively smooths out variations and reduces high-frequency noise in the data, making it a suitable choice for enhancing data quality without requiring prior information about the characteristics of the wearable-derived data. The default window is three samples wide, but it can be easily customized in the code and passed as parameter to the processing functions. The output of the data processing pipeline (i.e., the first three blocks in  The explored features focus on the time, frequency, and geometric domains. In particular, the latter domain is explored by resorting to the Poincaré plot, which allows easy visualization and analysis of recursive signals like heart rate. This method and the geometric features that can be extracted from the plot are widely used in heart rate variability analysis, thus those features have been included in the list of important features for the project ( Heart rate variability is correlated with the presence of ALS and MS ( Complete list of features for heart rate and beat-to-beat signals. The latter is derived by the inversion of the heart rate signal. Sleeping hours are a vital time to watch. Numerous physiological indicators, including respiratory rate and  Complete list of features for pulse oximetry signal. Complete list of features for respiration rate signal. The pipeline for signal processing and feature extraction has been validated using sample data collected during the project’s development period and the initial phase of patient enrollment. This data was obtained from 10 subjects participating in the BRAINTEASER clinical trial, including both ALS and MS patients. The subjects wore the Garmin Vivoactive 4s device in an outpatient setting without any specific tasks for data collection. The subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of A.O.U. Città della salute e della scienza di Torino (314/2021). In this work, we present the results on a representative subject with ALS, who used the device for 7 days to acquire a comprehensive data set that encompasses both daytime and nighttime periods. During this period, this individual engaged in various physical activities, which enabled the verification of the collected data’s quality and the assessment of the efficiency of the processing pipeline in eliminating potential artifacts resulting from the device’s movement on the wrist. The data presented here, as well as additional sample data, can be found in the repository linked as  The sample dataset contains some of the expected artifacts that the processing pipeline is asked to remove/correct. For instance, the sleeping time signal presents some peaks that could be a consequence of the wrong positioning of the device or compression of the sensor due to movement during sleep. Moreover, all signals present data gaps of different durations, which need to be identified and filled by linear interpolation if the gap duration is lower or equal to the limits previously. The results of the signal processing pipeline, comprising the initial three blocks outlined in  Example of the outcome of the application of the signal processing pipeline (first three blocks of  These results illustrate the varying susceptibility of different signals to artifacts. Specifically, the heart rate signal obtained from the wearable device was found to be suitable for feature extraction without the need for further processing. Conversely, the  The cleaned sample was utilized to extract sample features that will serve as input to the AI models. As an example,  List of the extracted features from the heart rate and beat-to-beat sample signal. List of the extracted features from blood oxygen saturation signal. List of the extracted features from the respiration rate sample signal. In this study, the validity and impact of the extracted features on model performance have not been directly evaluated. This evaluation is important to understand the effect of the pipeline on model performance. However, such an analysis would necessitate the complete development of dedicated ALS/MS models to fully leverage the features extracted by our pipeline, which is a matter of ongoing research and is out of the scope of the present manuscript. Of course, once these models are finalized within the framework of the BRAINTEASER project, future investigations will explore the impact of our processing and feature extraction steps on their performance. Health signals obtained from wearable devices present a valuable source of monitoring data for chronic diseases, and AI models can leverage this information to predict disease progression. In the context of the BRAINTEASER project, the Garmin Vivoactive 4 was selected as the device for training the AI models for monitoring the progression of MS and ALS. This paper presents the processing pipeline developed and intended for deployment in the BRAINTEASER project. This pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art techniques and addresses the requirements for analyzing these signals in a real-world consumer scenario. While numerous current techniques concentrate on high-frequency data obtained from specialized and case-specific sensors, this approach utilizes a readily accessible consumer device and their built-in sensors and features, such as optical sensors and pulse-oximeters. During the development and signal selection process, it was crucial to incorporate input from clinicians to ensure the extraction of necessary features and focus on the most relevant signals for the specific situation. The selection process also considered additional engineering and usability factors. However, as a result, the accelerometer data was discarded. It is worth noting that the readings from the accelerometer can be valuable for a variety of functionality assessments, particularly those related to motor skills. This interdisciplinary approach is of paramount importance to guarantee that the processing is performed on valuable signals for the specific case. This process results in the extraction of useful features that can be utilized in subsequent analysis steps or, for example, displayed in a monitoring interface. The proposed pipeline has been developed to work on data covering one day, but it can also process data in shorter time windows. However, when using shorter time windows, the consistency of certain features should be ensured the consistency of certain features. Regardless of the time window, patterns over multiple days can be analyzed at a later stage by comparing the extracted features and metrics as necessary. The proposed pipeline will be implemented in the BRAINTEASER project and continuously refined to meet the specific requirements of its application in the project. Future work will involve examining the noise characteristics of data obtained from wearable devices and evaluating various advanced noise-filtering approaches. One possible approach is to utilize Kalman filtering, as investigated in the study cited in (","['smartwatches', 'processing', 'feature extraction', 'health data', 'wearable devices', 'long-term health monitoring']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Digital Health,STD
11466866,What distinguishes life satisfaction from emotional wellbeing?,"The aim of this registered report is to investigate how the core components of subjective wellbeing, Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB), differ with respect to their relationship to antecedent factors. Seven factors are proposed that have been found in previous research to antecede LS and EWB. Social Comparisons, Meaningfulness, Economic/Social Resources, and Opportunities are hypothesized to correlate more closely with LS than EWB, while Time Use, Hassles/Uplifts, and Neuroticism are hypothesized to correlate more strongly with EWB than LS. A combined online and paper-and-pencil survey was administered to a representative sample of 974 Swedish citizens aged 15 years or older. LS and EWB were measured by self-report methods that have been developed and used in previous research. Index measures were constructed from self-reports of each antecedent factor by means of ratings on two scales developed in this study. Multivariate regression and relative weight analyses confirmed two of the hypotheses in showing that Economic/Social Resources and Opportunities were significantly more strongly related with LS than EWB. Of those hypothesized to correlate more strongly with EWB than LS, support was obtained for Neuroticism. Social Comparisons, Meaningfulness, Time Use, and Hassles/Uplifts did not have different relationships with LS and EWB. The results confirm that to some extent antecedent factors are differentially associated with LS and EWB, thus contributing to a better understanding of the antecedents of the cognitive and affective components of subjective wellbeing. Future research should further explore the mechanisms underlying these different relationships as well as moderators and mediators of the relationships.","Subjective wellbeing (SWB) is generally proposed to include two primary components: Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB) (Diener,  The relationship between LS and EWB is generally positive, with correlation coefficients typically ranging from moderate to strong ( Instead of relying solely on verbal reports, many studies have examined the associations between measures of LS and EWB in relation to different life circumstances. In an empirical study involving samples of women from the United States and France, Kahneman et al. ( Further support for the differences between LS and EWB arises from research indicating that EWB is more influenced than LS by time pressure in everyday life (e.g., Gärling et al.,  A complete understanding is lacking of why certain antecedents have different relationships with LS and EWB. People may directly consider stable life circumstances when making assessments of LS but also explicitly or implicitly place weight on other factors associated with these circumstances—factors which are more important for LS than EWB. In this registered report we propose the following four factors: social comparisons, economic and social resources, opportunities, and meaningfulness. Related to social comparisons, LS inherently carries a comparative aspect with individuals gauging their contentment in relation to others, perhaps employing a “good fortune” heuristic as suggested by Kahneman and Krueger ( According to Hypothesis 3, the presence of economic and social resources, both tangible and intangible (Gärling and Gamble,  An illustration of how the four hypotheses may explain differences between LS and EWB observed in previous research is the following. Unemployment has in several studies been shown to be related more strongly to low LS than low EWB (Knabe et al.,  For a full picture, it should furthermore be recognized that some factors may have stronger relationship with EWB than LS. Kahneman et al. ( In total we propose seven hypotheses (summarized in  The hypotheses tested. LS, Life Satisfaction; EWB, Emotional Wellbeing. To sum up, several studies have compared antecedents of LS and EWB, but they have limitations. First, they have not comprehensively examined a wide range of theoretically meaningful factors within a single study. Second, they lack preregistration, making it unclear if results were obtained through confirmatory or exploratory analyses, potentially increasing false positives and publication bias. The present study aims to address these limitations by testing a comprehensive set of preregistered hypotheses about the relative strengths of relationships between antecedent factors and LS vs. EWB, using data from a large nationwide Swedish sample. To examine the correlations of the hypothesized eight factors with LS and EWB, we use data from a survey of a representative sample of the Swedish population aged 15 years or older. The survey is a combined online and paper-and-pencil replication of the 11th wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) in Sweden that was conducted as face-to-face interviews. Both the sampling procedure and survey content hence closely resemble the standard ESS 11 but with an added set of questions related to SWB. As a result, many questions unrelated to the research question are included in the survey. Mirroring the approach of ESS 11, a stratified sampling technique is employed, with random samples drawn from each of the eight NUTS-2 regions in Sweden. A total of 1,500 individuals were invited to participate and offered a conditional incentive of SEK 300 in the form of gift cards, while an additional 1,500 participants were invited without being offered any incentive. The purpose of offering incentive to one group and not to the other was to investigate potential non-response bias effects. Since not directly relevant to this study, the two samples were combined in the analyses to leverage the full data set. The final net sample consisted of 1,074 individuals (35.8% response rate); however, for the analyses, we only retained participants who provided complete responses to the analyzed survey questions (n = 974). The complete stage 1 study protocol, data, and R code files can be accessed and downloaded from the OSF link:  LS was assessed using the following two items: “Imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. Assume that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. If the top step is 10 and the bottom step is 0, on which step of the ladder do you personally stand right now?”; and “All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays?” with end points labeled “0 Extremely dissatisfied” and “10 Extremely satisfied”. We employed merely two bipolar items to reduce the response burden while capturing evaluations that span from negative to positive wellbeing. This facilitates comparisons with EWB that likewise represents the wellbeing spectrum from negative to positive. It is consistent with Diener et al. ( EWB at the other end of the continuum is assessed by means of retrospective ratings of the frequency of emotions experienced during the past week. Six unipolar adjective scales with seven steps ranging from “never” (0) to “always” (6) were used. Each scale is defined by three adjectives taken from the Swedish Core Affect Scale (SCAS) (Västfjäll et al.,  In this study self-report measures were developed of the eight candidate factors (resources are separated in Economic and Social) hypothesized to have different correlations with LS and EWB. Each were measured with two items (translated into the English) as follows: Social comparisons: “I am more successful than others”; and “I have achieved more than others in my age.” Meaningfulness: “My life is meaningful”; and “I have goals in life that are very important to me.” Economic resources: “My economic resources are good”; and “I have a high material living standard.” Social resources: “I have good support from relatives, friends, and coworkers”; and “People in my surroundings are there for me.” Opportunities: “I have many opportunities to do what I want in life”; and “My life is full of opportunities.” Time use: “I have enough time to do the things I want to do”; and “I have time for relaxing activities.” Hassles and uplifts: “In my everyday life, I experience too many small disturbances or obstacles”; and “There are often things that uplift my everyday life.” Neuroticism: “I easily feel stressed and anxious”; and “I easily feel sad and depressed.” Descriptive statistics of the sample (n = 974). Means (M), standard deviations (SD), Cronbach's α, and product moment correlations of all variables ( Multivariate multiple regression (MMR) was employed to analyze the relationships between the dependent variables (LS and EWB) and the independent variables (social comparisons, meaningfulness, economic resources, social resources, opportunities, time use, hassles/uplifts, and neuroticism). MMR performs a simultaneous analysis of multiple dependent variables taking into account the correlations between them (Hartung and Knapp,  Standardized coefficients estimated by multivariate regressions of the hypothesized independent variables on the dependent variables Life Satisfaction and Emotional Wellbeing ( Coefficients in bold are statistically significant at the 5% level. In a test of the hypotheses (see  Differences between Life Satisfaction and Emotional Wellbeing (LS-EWB) in standardized regression coefficients for the independent variables (n = 974). Differences in bold are statistically significant at the 5% level. In addition to the MMR, a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA, Johnson,  The results show ( Relative importance (proportion of explained variance) of the association of the independent variables with Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB). Differences between Life Satisfaction (LS) and Emotional Wellbeing (EWB) (LS-EWB) in proportion explained variance estimated by relative weight analysis for each independent variable ( Differences in bold are statistically significant at the 5% level. This study aimed at investigating the differential relations a set of antecedent factors have with LS and EWB, the two primary components of SWB. Based on previous research and theoretical considerations, we tested seven different hypothesis regarding factors that relate differentially to LS and EWB. The findings provide partial support for the hypothesized differences in the correlations between these factors and LS and EWB, respectively. The multivariate multiple regression (MMR) analysis followed by a relative weight analysis (RWA) consistently showed that economic resources, social resources and opportunities are more strongly associated with LS than EWB, supporting Hypotheses 3a-b and 4. These results suggest that individuals' perceptions of their economic wealth, social support and future prospects play a more significant role for their life satisfaction than for their day-to-day emotional experiences. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of stable life circumstances for LS (Kahneman et al.,  The results provided additional consistent support for Hypothesis 3b, indicating that social resources are more important for LS than EWB. This finding suggests that the presence of supportive social networks may contribute more to individuals' life satisfaction than to their daily affective experiences, but this pattern is less pronounced than the difference in economic resources. Nevertheless, the finding is intriguing given that some previous research has pointed to the strong importance of social activities for EWB (Kahneman et al.,  The results also consistenly confirmed Hypothesis 7, demonstrating that neuroticism has a stronger relationship with EWB than with LS. This finding aligns with Schimmack et al.'s ( Results from both analyses did not support the hypothesized stronger relationship with LS than EWB of social comparisons (Hypothesis 1) and meaningfulness (Hypothesis 2). First, social comparisons (e.g., perceiving oneself to be more successful than others) were weakly related to both LS and EWB, with associations of similar magnitude, suggesting that relative comparisons may not be that important for LS (Veenhoven and Vergunst,  A compelling case can be made that meaningfulness is more important for LS than EWB, as people can find life meaningful even during periods of distress. However, our results do not support this proposition, as the associations between meaningfulness and both LS and EWB were similar and did not differ significantly. This finding suggests that the influence of meaningfulness on wellbeing may be more complex than hypothesized, and its effects on LS and EWB more intertwined than previously thought. The hypothesized stronger relationships of time use (Hypothesis 5) and hassles/uplifts (Hypothesis 6) with EWB compared to LS were not confirmed. These findings suggest that the influence of these factors on LS and EWB may likewise be more complex than initially assumed, warranting further investigation. We also note that the hypothesis of time use being more important for EWB than LS is primarily based on the results of studies using the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). In the DRM (Kahneman et al.,  We expected hassles/uplifts to have a stronger relationship with EWB than LS, given the direct connection to daily affective states. However, our findings suggest that the cumulative effect of daily hassles/uplifts may also have substantially association with LS. Future research should employ more fine-grained measures that distinguish between recent and long-term experiences of hassles and uplifts to better grasp the nuances between their relationships to LS and EWB. This study contributes to the growing body of research exploring the different antecedents of LS and EWB. By identifying factors that may differentially influence these two components of SWB, the study provides a more nuanced understanding of the differences between LS and EWB. Our results may partly explain previous puzzles in the SWB research. For instance, a recent study of the unemployed (Fors Connolly and Gärling,  The strengths of this study include the use of a large representative sample and the application of both MMR and RWA to test the hypotheses. However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to draw causal inferences about these relationships. Future research employing longitudinal designs would provide further insights into their temporal dynamics. Second, the use of self-report measures may be subject to response biases, such as evaluative biases or biased recall (Schimmack,  A broader potential critique of our analysis is that we did not model SWB as a general factor with LS and EWB as specific factors (i.e., a bifactor model). This approach aligns with the study of Busseri and Quoidbach ( In conclusion, this study confirms that to some extent antecedent factors are differentially associated with LS and EWB, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between these two components of SWB. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at enhancing wellbeing should consider the unique determinants of LS and EWB, and that future research should further explores the mechanisms underlying these differential relationships. Future research should also investigate potential moderators or mediators that may influence the associations between the antecedent factors and the SWB components.","['antecedent factors', 'emotional wellbeing', 'life satisfaction', 'survey', 'Swedish citizens', 'subjective well-being']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Psychology,STD
11466681,Coccygeal Nerve Blockade vs. Impar Ganglion Blockade in Coccydynia: A Randomised Clinical Trial,"Background and objective Coccydynia is a condition that causes pain around the coccyx, severely limiting functionality. Interventional treatment options are available for cases that do not respond to conservative treatment. Coccygeal nerve block (CnB) is a novel method for treating coccydynia. This study compared the efficacy of CnB and ganglion impar block (GiB) and aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CnB in treating coccydynia. Methods  The 12-week results of 56 patients were analysed. One group underwent ultrasound (US)-guided CnB, while the other group underwent fluoroscopy (FL)-guided GiB. Pain intensity was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS), and functionality was assessed using the PARIS Coccydynia Functionality Questionnaire. Evaluations were conducted before treatment, as well as four and 12 weeks after treatment. Results The baseline median NRS score was eight in both groups, while at week 12, it was three in the CnB group and 2.5 in the GiB group. The median PARIS score at baseline was seven in the CnB group and 6.5 in the GiB group, while at week 12, it was four and three, respectively. At week 12, compared to baseline, both the CNB and GiB groups showed statistically significant improvements in NRS and PARIS scores (p<0.001). When comparing the two groups, no significant difference was observed in the NRS and PARIS scores before and four and 12 weeks after treatment. No serious adverse events were observed in any patient. Conclusions  Coccydynia is sometimes refractory to treatment. In our study, we found that CnB, a method recently used in the treatment of coccydynia, was as effective as GiB, which has been used for a long time, and we found no evidence of superiority. The lack of radiation exposure due to its US-guided application, the superficial course of the coccygeal nerves and the low depth of needle penetration make it easier to perform. These advantages suggest that it will be a preferable method in the treatment of coccydynia.","Coccydynia is a condition characterised by pain around the coccyx, which can be caused by musculoskeletal conditions, infection, or malignancy. The etiology is often attributed to trauma or childbirth. Risk factors include female gender, obesity, rapid weight loss, variations in coccygeal morphology, and coccygeal hypermobility. It is more prevalent in middle-aged women [ Increased pain with sitting is a typical clinical presentation for coccydynia. Pain can be worsened by getting up from a sitting position, prolonged standing, the premenstrual period, sexual intercourse, and bowel movements [ Diagnosis of coccydynia is made using clinical and imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can visualise the sacrococcygeal joints and the distal coccyx bone and rule out secondary pathologies such as infection and tumours in this region. Dynamic MRI may also be used to diagnose coccygeal movement [ The impar ganglion, located anterior to the coccyx, is the end point of the sympathetic chain and is responsible for nociception and sympathetic innervation of the perineal region [ The coccygeal nerve is composed of the coccygeal plexus and is responsible for receiving sensation from the coccyx region. Upon exiting the sacral hiatus, the coccygeal nerves travel inferiorly, passing medial to the coccygeal cornu and laterally under the transverse process of the first coccygeal vertebra. The nerve follows a superficial course at this level [ There was limited literature data on coccygeal nerve block (CnB) [ The primary aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of CnB, a new method in the treatment of coccidynia, with GiB, an established method. Secondary aims were to evaluate the effect of the interventions on the functionality score and to determine the adverse events associated with the interventions. This study was conducted as a randomised, controlled, and prospective trial. Ethics committee approval was obtained from the local hospital, and the Clinical Trial submission system was registered (Clinical Trial Number NCT06242587). This study was conducted in the single-center pain clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We used a computer-assisted randomisation program to categorise patients into groups. The other researcher as an independent statistician, unaffiliated with the enrollment of participants, produced the random allocation sequence. This sequence was retrieved through a secure system online. To maintain the integrity of allocation concealment, treatment assignments were enclosed in sealed, nontransparent envelopes. The interventions were performed by a physician with at least five years of experience in US and fluoroscopy (FL). The researcher who collected and analyzed the patients' pain and functionality scores did not know which patient received which intervention.  Participants The inclusion criteria included age between 18 and 70 years, coccydynia >3 months, unresponsive to conservative treatments (such as medication, sitting cushion, physiotherapy), and confirmation of the diagnosis of coccydynia by an MRI. The exclusion criteria included those with a secondary pathology detected by an MRI (malignancy, infection), pregnancy, presence of additional rheumatological diseases, L4-L5-S1 discopathy, diabetes mellitus, interventional procedures or for coccydynia in the last six months, and previous coccyx surgery. Interventions All procedures were performed without sedation, under local anaesthesia, and in sterile conditions. Patients were monitored according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) standards. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mmHg for at least one minute or a drop of more than 20%-30% of MAP during the procedures was defined as hypotension and treated with intravenous crystalloids and vasopressors (usually ephedrine).  CnB Under US guidance, a CnB was performed in the intervention room. The patient was positioned prone and covered with a sterile drape. Using a 5-12 MHz linear US probe (LOGIQ P9, GE Ultrasound, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), the sacral cornuas and sacrococcygeal ligament were visualised. The transducer was then advanced 2-3 mm caudally to visualise the coccygeal cornuas. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were anaesthetised with 1% lidocaine using a 27-gauge needle. Using the in-plane technique, a 22-gauge spinal needle was inserted superomedial to the coccygeal cornu. Negative aspiration was confirmed before injecting 1 mL (4 mg) of dexamethasone (to prolong the duration of pain relief and for anti-inflammatory activity) and 1 mL (5 mg) of bupivacaine 0.5% for each nerve (8 mg dexamethasone and 10 mg bupivacaine total for each patient). Patients were monitored for possible complications for two hours after the procedure. Figure  A shows the ultrasound probe (red rectangle) positioned over the sacral cornu, while B shows the ultrasound image of the sacral cornu and the sacrococcygeal ligament at this probe position. C shows the ultrasound probe advanced caudally toward the coccygeal cornu, while D shows the ultrasound image of the coccygeal cornu at this probe position. E shows the position of the needle insertion relative to the ultrasound probe, while F shows the ultrasound image of the needle on the coccygeal horn. G shows the position of the needle insertion relative to the ultrasound probe, while H shows the possible position of the coccygeal nerve on the ultrasound image and the distribution of the administered drug. Red rectangle: Ultrasound probe GiB The GiB was performed in the operating room under FL guidance using a transcoccygeal approach. The patient was placed in the prone position, and the skin was sterilised and draped. The level of the procedure was determined using a lateral C-arm FL view. The skin and subcutaneous tissue were anaesthetised with 1% lidocaine using a 27-gauge needle. Once the target area was reached with a 22-gauge spinal needle, 2 cc of contrast medium (iohexol, 300 mg iodine/ml, GE Healthcare) was administered. Contrast agent was observed as a reverse coma sign, which is typical of an GiB. After negative aspiration, a total of 2 mL (8 mg) of dexamethasone, 2 mL (10 mg) of 0.5% bupivacaine, and 2 mL of saline were injected. Patients were monitored for side effects for two hours. Figure  A shows the needle passing through the intervertebral space to the anterior side of the coccyx for ganglion impar blockade, and B shows the appropriate contrast agent spread Outcome measurements The primary outcome of this study was to evaluate and compare the changes in pain intensity between CnB and GiB using the numerical rating scale (NRS) score. The NRS scale was used to assess pain intensity. Patients were shown a template with numbers ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain) and were asked to mark the intensity of their pain. The NRS scale was marked three times: before the procedure, four weeks after the procedure, and 12 weeks after the procedure. One of the secondary outcomes of this study was to analyse changes in the functional status of the patients using the PARIS functional questionnaire. This questionnaire includes self-administered questions about pain during various activities and assesses the relationship between pain and physical activity on a scale of 0 to 10. The questionnaire was completed by patients at the initial assessment and 12 weeks after the procedure. The other secondary outcome was the detection of adverse events related to the interventions. Statistical analyses and sample size All analyses were performed with the jamovi project version 2.3 (Released 2022; Jamovi, Computer Software, Sydney, Australia). The results of the study are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Normality analysis was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, skewness-curvature, and histograms. Normally distributed variables are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. Numerical dependent variables were compared between groups using independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Repeated measures were analysed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Changes over time were compared using the Bonferroni correction. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The sample size was based on primary outcomes and calculations performed with the G*Power version 3.1.9.4 software program (Released 2019; Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany) by taking an effect size 0.692, α = 0.05, power (1-β) = 0.90. A total of 37 individuals were reached for each group. Sencan et al.'s third-week NRS scores (mean and SD values) were obtained for this analysis [ In total, 118 patients with coccydynia were screened for eligibility. A total of 19 patients refused to participate in the study and 23 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 76 patients were randomised into CnB and GiB groups, with 38 patients in each group, and interventions were performed. After exclusion during the follow-up period, the study was completed with 30 patients in the CnB group and 26 in the GiB group. A patient flowchart is shown in Figure  There was no difference in age, sex, and aetiology between the two groups (Table  a: Independent sample T-test; b: Chi-square test; c: Mann-Whitney U test

There were no differences between baseline and week 12 scores between groups. When analysed within groups, the decrease in PARIS scores observed at week 12 was statistically significant (p < 0.001 for both groups) (Tables  During the treatment, two patients in Group CnB experienced numbness at the injection site, and one patient experienced hyperalgesia. In Group GiB, one patient had the needle tip advanced a little too far, but it did not cause rectal perforation. Antibiotic treatment was started prophylactically. Two patients experienced hypotension, and one patient had a transient increase in pain. Hypotension was mild and appropriately treated with crystalloid infusion without complications. These mild adverse events resolved spontaneously within 18 hours in both groups, with the longest lasting without the need for treatment. No major complications were observed with either intervention. This is the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided CnB at the level of the coccygeal cornuas in the treatment of coccydynia. After 12 weeks of follow-up, both GiB and CnB were found to have similar efficacy in reducing pain and improving function in patients with chronic coccydynia. Pericococcygeal injection, caudal epidural injection, and GiB are methods in persistent coccydynia. Injection content varies as a local anaesthetic, steroid, dextrose, and combinations [ Pericoccygeal injections can be considered a first-line injection method because they are minimally invasive and can be performed with a blind technique. This technique can be performed using US guidance or blind technique, but FL is rarely used. The injection site is typically located at the sacrococcygeal junction or most painful points. Conflicting data exists regarding its effectiveness [ Caudal epidural injection is another frequently used method. It can be performed with both FL and US (4). It is a more favourable option for patients with lower lumbar radicular pain accompanying coccydynia. In terms of efficacy, Sencan et al. compared GiB with caudal epidural steroid injection in the treatment of coccydynia and found that GiB was more effective [ Based on the available information, the GiB seems to be the most effective interventional procedure among those discussed above for coccydynia. The procedure can be performed using various approaches, including transcoccygeal and sacrococcygeal, and can also be guided by FL or US. Ghai et al. stated no complications in 15 patients who underwent GiB with US and reported US-guided intervention as a safe method. However, considering its close proximity to the rectum, we believe that FL-guided intervention is more reliable [ In 2021, two meta-analyses of coccydynia treatment were published by Andersen and Choudhary [ The coccygeal nerves arise from the coccygeal plexus and are responsible for pain sensation in this region. After emerging from the sacral hiatus, they become superficial as they follow a mediolateral course through the coccygeal cornuas. This superficial course makes it easy to reach the nerve with US [ Although Gruber et al. said that the coccygeal nerves can be reached above the sacral cornu by US, sometimes the coccygeal nerves are located between the sacrococcygeal ligament and the medial wall of the sacral cornu at this level [ Domingo-Rufes et al. described a US-guided block of the coccygeal nerves at the level of the sacral cornu. They visualised the sacral hiatus and the sacrococcygeal ligament with US and inserted the needle into the sacral canal along the medial edge of the sacral cornu using an out-of-plane approach. However, there is a risk of caudal epidural puncture if the needle tip passes the S2 level [ Recently, Wu et al. published a paper in which they blocked the coccygeal nerves at the level of the coccygeal cornu under US guidance in a case of coccydynia. In this article, it is stated that the nerve trapped in the medial part of the coccygeal cornu can be visualised with the US probe and is safe in terms of the risk of epidural puncture as the injection site is outside the sacral hiatus. After two local anaesthetic injections two weeks apart, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores decreased by more than 50% [ Following Wu's case report, Can et al. published an article with 32 patients [ In terms of side effects, although GiB is usually associated with minor side effects, serious side effects such as rectal perforation, cauda equina syndrome, and neuritis have been reported [ Regarding adverse events associated with coccygeal nerve procedures, paraesthesias and increased pain were reported in three patients in the study by Can et al. In the CnB group in our study, two patients developed paraesthesia and one patient developed hyperalgesia at the injection site, but no treatment was required. In terms of adverse events, we had only minor adverse events like Can et al. We had two complications requiring treatment in the GiB group, but all adverse events resolved spontaneously without treatment in the CnB group. The superiority of the CnB over the GiB was that it was performed under US guidance. The absence of radiation exposure is an advantage for both the practitioner and the patient. Although it is said that the GiB can also be performed with US, there is a serious risk of major complications. In addition, the superficial course of the coccygeal nerve means that it is sufficient to advance the needle tip about 1 cm during the procedure. This results in the patient experiencing less pain during the procedure. In our clinical practice, the CnB was easier to perform than the GiB. Our study had several limitations. First,, we could not evaluate the effect of interventions on analgesic consumption. Second, we could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments according to aetiologic perspectives. Third, we could not evaluate the effect of the interventions on the quality of life, mood, anxiety, and sleep quality. There are many invasive methods that can be used in patients with chronic coccydynia who do not respond to conservative treatment. However, nerve block at the level of the coccygeal cornu is a relatively new method. The present study is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of this new method. The results of this study do not provide evidence that GiB and CnB are superior to each other in terms of pain relief. The possible advantages of CnB include no radiation exposure, the site is far from the epidural space, no contrast is required, and it is easier to use because of the superficial course of the nerve. Further studies will increase our knowledge of the success of this method.","['coccydynia treatment', 'coccyx pain', 'fluoroscopy intervention', 'nerve block', 'peripheral nerve ultrasonography']",,Cureus,STD
11469534,Sore Throat to Still’s: Group A Streptococcus Causing Adult-Onset Still’s Disease,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare hyper-inflammatory disease with poorly understood etiology, often presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, inflammatory polyarthralgia, transient salmon-pink maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. We are presenting an unusual case of AOSD triggered by Group A streptococci (GAS) throat infection. We report the case of a 37-year-old male with no significant medical history admitted to medicine service after three emergency room (ER) visits. Our patient had a confirmed GAS throat infection and initially met the Jones criteria. However, further testing revealed significantly high inflammatory markers, clinically evident symmetrical synovitis in wrists and left knee, and widespread lymphadenopathy with worsening maculopapular rash. Given this, he met the Yamaguchi criteria, resulting in a diagnosis of AOSD. Group A Streptococcus infections are usually linked to acute rheumatic fever (ARF), but in our case, we believe GAS infection triggered the cascade of inflammatory responses resulting in AOSD. The patient received treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and high-dose steroids with a resolution of arthralgia, down-trending ferritin, and clinical improvement in a skin rash. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first case of GAS-triggered AOSD, highlighting the need to uncover atypical causes for AOSD and warranting the need to investigate triggers for AOSD.","Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an uncommon systemic autoimmune disorder with poorly understood etiology and often is a diagnosis of exclusion that contributes to delay in diagnosis, so it is crucial to have a clear diagnostic flow [ A 37-year-old Ecuadorian male with no known medical history was initially evaluated in the ER on day three after his symptoms started for a pruritic rash on his upper back and left lower abdomen. During the first ER visit, there were concerns about shingles or insect bites; the patient was discharged from the ED after a dose of diphenhydramine with hydrocortisone 1% topical cream because of a localized allergic reaction. The patient had an insidious onset of arthralgias one to two weeks after the initial ER visit with subjective fevers and persistent rash; all the symptoms were getting worse. The patient later returned to the ER on day 62 with complaints of flu-like symptoms, intense joint pains, intermittent subjective fever, and chills with a persistent rash on the chest. The patient was found to have a febrile temperature of 38.7°C in triage with tachycardia of 107 beats per minute (bpm). His lab reports were significant for a positive throat swab for GAS, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,000 cells/μL, AST of 43 IU/L, and ALT of 87 IU/L. His chest X-ray was negative for acute pathology. The patient was treated with clindamycin 900 mg IV and discharged from the ER with a diagnosis of GAS throat infection and was prescribed a short course of oral clindamycin. The patient returned to the ER a few days later, on day 69, with persistent but worsening sore throat, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and intermittent fever. He was febrile in the ER with a temperature of 38.8 °C and tachycardia of 112 bpm. The patient denied any recent travels or hiking. His labs were significant for elevated WBC of 19,900 cells/μL, AST of 58 IU/L, ALT of 149 IU/L, nonreactive HIV antigen-antibody, lactic acidosis of 4.5 mmol/L, CRP of 232 mg/L, ESR of 96 mm/hr. Sepsis protocol was initiated, and the patient received weight-based fluid resuscitation, received intramuscular penicillin G injection 1.2 million units with a stat dose of vancomycin 1,500 mg, with minimal symptomatic relief. A CT scan of the neck with IV contrast was normal; the patient was discharged from the ED the same day and recommended to follow up with a primary care provider (PCP). However, the patient returned to the ED on day 72 with a worsening rash (Figure  The patient denied any sick contacts and was admitted to the medicine service with suspicion of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) secondary to GAS. The patient was started on empirical antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-sulbactam for GAS infection treatment; on the fourth visit, admission, labs were significant for persistent leucocytosis and further worsening. Reports of AST of 460 IU/L/ALT of 847 IU/L and ultrasound of the abdomen showed diffuse hepatic steatosis with a nonreactive viral hepatitis panel for hepatitis A, B, and C. During the initial days of admission, the patient complained of migratory arthralgia in the bilateral wrist, right shoulder, right knee, and left ankle with redness or swelling of affected joints. X-ray imaging of affected joints showed no acute pathology; a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis done with contrast was notable for bilateral atelectasis. no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy were noted. Antistreptolysin-O and anti-Dnase titles were found to be in normal ranges. We considered several differential diagnoses, focusing mainly on infection mimics such as ARF due to the overlap in symptoms with AOSD. Other mimics, like infections, including viral as well as bacterial, were ruled out as per infectious diseases consult. Hematology was consulted and recommended that his symptoms and labs were consistent with inflammatory syndrome rather than malignancy. On day 75, naproxen 500 mg twice daily was started; during the days following appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) dosing, arthralgia resolved on day 78. The patient had symptomatic relief; however, he did have a persistent rash and worsening liver function and was found to have hyperferritinemia of 88,000 ng/mL and an IL-2 level of 13,277 pg/mL. The patient met the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD, including arthralgia for more than two weeks, typical rash, a WBC count of more than 10,000 cells/μL, sore throat, and abnormal liver enzymes, with GAS being the suspected triggering factor. Figure  PO: per oral; QD: four times a day Clinical exam and hyperferritinemia of 92,999 ng/mL were suggestive of severe systemic inflammation and organ involvement-liver, associated with AOSD, hence, three days of methylprednisone 1,000 mg was given from day 83 till day 85, resulting in quick resolution of symptoms, followed by slow tapering, high dose steroids during the inpatient stay. One mg/kg oral prednisone was used due to the persistence of severe symptoms or organ involvement, significantly elevated inflammatory markers as listed in Table  WBC: white blood count; NA: not available; GAS: Group A  AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug CRP: C-reactive protein; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug A skin biopsy was done, and it showed perivascular dermatitis with extravasated erythrocytes and rare eosinophils and neutrophils. The patient was discharged on day 91 after an extended inpatient stay on oral prednisone 60 mg daily. The patient was seen in an outpatient setting on day 99 and found to have a resolving rash on physical examination and a further downtrend in inflammatory markers; the patient was continued on prednisone 60 mg four times a day (QD). Following the clinic visit on day 114, the patient was tolerating slow tapering of steroids and was noted to have decreased left knee effusion; however, the patient reported bilateral knee pain and left elbow pain. The patient was started on methotrexate 7.5 mg and prednisone was tapered down to 50 mg QD. Methotrexate is typically initiated at 15-25 mg/week in autoimmune diseases like AOSD. We started with 7.5 mg as there were concerns about liver function (elevated liver enzymes) but it was increased to 15 mg/week on the next follow-up visit after blood showed normalization of liver function. We tapered steroids along with starting methotrexate, hence, to achieve disease control with the tapering and eventual discontinuation of steroids, we transitioned the patient to steroid-sparing agent methotrexate. Table  Adult-onset Still's disease is a rare clinical entity. Due to the lack of definitive diagnostic tests, diagnosing AOSD is challenging, and clinical criteria hold an essential place in diagnosing this life-threatening condition. Yamaguchi criteria is widely used in diagnosing AOSD; major criteria include fever of at least 39°C for at least one week, arthralgia or arthritis for at least two weeks, non-pruritic salmon-colored rash on the trunk/extremities, granulocytic leukocytosis (10,000/mL or greater), and minor criteria are sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, and negative in tests for rheumatoid factor (RF) and ANA. [ Though our patient had three ED visits for on and off subjective fevers, sore throat, non-resolving rash, and worsening migratory polyarthralgia, he was admitted to the medicine floor after eight weeks of initial clinical presentation, therefore, having high clinical suspicion is crucial to prevent delayed or misdiagnosis. Presentation of AOSD is often found to be very similar to other systemic diseases [ The proposed mechanism for AOSD is similar to other autoimmune diseases, likely secondary to various triggers in genetically predisposed individuals [ Given widespread microbial and non-microbial triggers, there is growing evidence that infections could cause these rare disorders. Due to the growing incidence of these infections, investing resources to study the agents inducing inflammatory responses resulting in autoimmunity is appropriate. Although it is well known that GAS pharyngitis patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent ARF and eradicate GAS carriage, patients who have had ARF benefit from long-term antibiotics in terms of preventing recurrences and severity of ARF in subsequent attacks [ Our case report highlights the difficulty with diagnosing AOSD. As this is a clinical diagnosis, the most commonly used is the Yamaguchi criteria. However, these criteria have high sensitivity but very low specificity, so high clinician suspicion aided by diagnostic criteria and blood work can help diagnose these inflammatory syndromes. Along with diagnosing the disease, understanding the etiology would push clinicians to suspect these rare pathologies. Multiple authors have reported cases in the literature to identify various triggering factors. The case we are reporting is to isolate GAS as one of the etiologies for AOSD, although further epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the genuine associated risk with these triggers.","['adult-onset acute rheumatic fever', 'adult-onset still’s disease', 'autoinflammatory disease', 'group a β hemolytic streptococci', 'hyperferritinemia']",,Cureus,Gonorrhea
11464204,Understanding the influence of the microbiome on childhood infections,"The microbiome is known to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.","The human microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes – including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea – that have co-evolved with our species for millennia. The number of microbes colonizing our bodies is truly staggering; for instance, infants have an estimated 1.9 trillion human cells but are colonized by more than twice that number of microbial cells, including approximately 4.4 trillion bacterial cells [ At no point across the lifespan is the microbiome as dynamic as during childhood. At birth, infants are colonized by trillions of pioneering microbes from the maternal vaginal, gut, and skin microbiota. Over the ensuing days and months, these microbial communities undergo substantial shifts in composition due to changes in the local microenvironment, environmental exposures, and microbial competition. For instance, shortly after birth, the gut is an aerobic environment typically containing high abundances of facultative anaerobes, including bacteria from the genera  Although recent studies suggest that host genetics influences the microbiota during childhood [ The comparatively few pediatric microbiome studies that have been conducted after infancy suggest that the microbiota continues to develop and mature in response to environmental exposures. In particular, increasing age has consistently been associated with changes in microbiota composition during toddlerhood. During the second and third years of life, the gut microbiota increases in diversity (number of species), and a gradual loss of  Other environmental factors have been associated with alterations to the microbiota during childhood. Among 33 Japanese children, those who attended daycare were less likely to have nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles dominated by the health-associated species  The human microbiota provides protection against infection by preventing colonization and invasion by exogenous pathogens. This important function of the microbiota, referred to as colonization resistance, occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including competition for nutritional sources, production of antimicrobial compounds, alterations of the local microenvironment, and modulation of host immune responses ( Early-life colonization of mucosal surfaces by microbes is critical to immune system development [ The human microbiota continues to modulate immune system function throughout the lifespan. In health, microbiome-host homeostasis is characterized by low levels of inflammation and immune cell recruitment sufficient to create a state that is primed to respond to potential pathogens [ The microbiota influences the development of host immune responses to pathogens through several mechanisms. Commensal microbes can induce host epithelial cells to secrete antimicrobial peptides that target specific pathogens, as well as other commensal species [ With advances in our knowledge of the factors that disrupt microbiome composition during childhood and the role that the microbiota plays in immune development, there has been substantial interest in identifying microbiome characteristics that are associated with infection susceptibility or severity ( Globally, acute respiratory infections cause more than 740,000 child deaths each year [ There are accumulating data that early-life infections alter microbiome composition or function, contributing to differences in colonization resistance and infection susceptibility later in childhood. In a longitudinal study of 114 healthy infants, de Steenhuijsen Piters and colleagues found that asymptomatic viral infections occurring in the first few months of life were associated with a strong upper respiratory mucosal interferon response that coincided with enrichment of the upper respiratory microbiota by genera containing common pathogens ( The severity of respiratory infections is also influenced by upper respiratory microbiota composition. A cross-sectional study of children and adolescents found that a microbiota profile dominated by the putatively beneficial bacterial genera  Substantial evidence links the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric infections and other infections arising from the gut.  Bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality among several vulnerable populations of children. Among premature infants, late-onset sepsis is frequently caused by gut-derived bacteria, and these infections are often preceded by loss of potentially beneficial species from the gut microbiota and an increase in the gut abundance of the BSI-causative strain [ The gut microbiota is also the major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microbes in human populations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which theoretically enables detection of all antibiotic resistance genes present within a sample (referred to as the ‘resistome’), has substantially advanced our ability to study antibiotic resistance during childhood. Several studies of the gut resistome among children have demonstrated that acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs early in life, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment or other recognized risk factors [ Adolescents account for more than half of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States [ The composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota has also been associated with the risk of HIV infection. Women with cervicovaginal microbiomes with low abundances of  The oral microbiome is integral to the pathogenesis of early childhood caries, a condition caused by specific bacteria in the supragingival plaque that create an acidic microenvironment that promotes tooth demineralization and decay. Higher abundances of  With accumulating evidence that the microbiota influences infection risk and severity, there has been substantial interest in the development of microbiome-targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of infections. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, several such interventions have been studied in infants and children. Because the gut microbiota is recognized to play a critical role in the development of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, there has long been interest in modifying the gut microbiota of premature infants through the administration of probiotics. A recent meta-analysis that included 106 randomized controlled trials of more than 25,000 infants concluded that multiple-strain probiotics, especially when combined with prebiotics, were associated with lower incidences of severe necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality, whereas single-strain probiotics combined with lactoferrin were most effective in lowering the incidence of sepsis [ Most studies of probiotics in older children have evaluated these products among children with acute diarrhea or for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or CDI. Probiotic trials conducted among children with diarrheal illnesses have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefit. For instance, in a study of a probiotic containing a strain of the yeast  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used in the management of recurrent CDI for nearly two decades, although use of this procedure in children has been limited until relatively recently. Fortunately, there have been several recent studies demonstrating that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for children with recurrent CDI. For instance, Nicholson and colleagues recently summarized outcomes of 372 patients aged 11 months to 23 years with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT at 18 pediatric health centers between 2004 and 2017 [ Phage therapy, in which viruses that target and kill bacteria (bacteriophages) are used for infection treatment, dates back more than a century; however, there has been renewed interest in phages as a result of rising antibiotic resistance. Few controlled trials of phage therapy have been conducted among children; most notably, a clinical trial of  Vaccines have contributed to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality over the past century and continue to prevent nearly 3 million child deaths each year [ Perhaps the most compelling data supporting an association between the gut microbiota and responses to childhood vaccines comes from experiments conducted in animal models. In a landmark study, Lynn and colleagues demonstrated that infant mice that were exposed to ampicillin and neomycin prior to receipt of inactivated or live vaccines developed inferior vaccine-induced antibody responses [ Findings from clinical studies of the impact of the gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity have demonstrated varied and often conflicting results ( With the recognition that the gut microbiota may influence immune responses to vaccination comes the possibility that targeted modification of the gut microbiota could promote vaccine-elicited immunity. In particular, there has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as vaccine adjuvants. Isolauri and colleagues reported that oral administration of  In conclusion, the human microbiota undergoes marked shifts in composition during early life as a result of environmental exposures. During infancy, these microbes are essential to immune maturation, promoting the generation of protective immune responses to potential pathogens and the development of immune tolerance to commensal microbes and host antigens. Throughout childhood, the commensal microbiota influences the risk and severity of infections through a complex network of microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactions collectively referred to as colonization resistance. This important function of the microbiota influences the risk of many infectious diseases that are common among healthy children and adolescents, including acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, the microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gut-derived BSIs among vulnerable groups of children, including premature infants and pediatric HCT recipients. Data from animal experiments and correlative human studies also suggest that the microbiota influences immune responses to childhood vaccines. Taken together, the studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the substantial influence of the microbiota on infectious diseases during childhood and the enormous potential of microbiome-based therapies to prevent or treat infections and promote vaccine-elicited immunity among children. Our understanding of the influence of the microbiota on childhood infections has advanced remarkably over the past several decades. However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. To date, we know surprisingly little regarding factors that shape microbial communities and their influence on infections outside of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts or in older children and adolescents. For instance, few prior studies have investigated the microbiota of the male reproductive tract and the extent to which it influences the transmission of STIs among adolescents. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of studies of the early life microbiome have focused solely on bacteria, effectively disregarding the potential impact of microbes from other kingdoms on childhood infections. Finally, there is growing recognition that the microbiome field needs to move beyond correlative studies in order to accelerate the development of microbiome-based interventions to prevent or treat infections and other diseases in children. One of the main challenges facing the field is translating what we have learned about the microbiome to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutics for childhood infections. Next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to diagnosing infections. Recently, several commercial laboratories have developed assays that enable detection of clinically relevant microbes in a variety of human samples with a short turnaround time, providing results that can be used to guide clinical decision-making. These sequencing technologies also have the potential to transform the field of infection prevention and control. Multilocus sequence typing, which involves sequencing of only a handful of microbial genes that typically represent less than 1% of the genome, remains a standard approach for the evaluation of healthcare-associated infection clusters [ Since November 2022, the first two microbiota-based human therapeutics for adults with recurrent  As sequencing technologies and analytic methods become increasingly high-throughput and accessible, we anticipate that the study of the child microbiome will advance in several ways over the next 5 years. First, there will be an increase in studies investigating the extent to which fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa influence childhood infections through both microbe-host and microbe–microbe interactions, including interspecies interactions spanning microbial kingdoms. Moreover, we will see a continued shift from simple correlative studies to translational studies that utilize novel experimental models or that integrate data on microbial gene expression, microbial and host metabolites, and host immune responses. Additionally, commercial next-generation sequencing assays will be further validated as diagnostic tools and incorporated into routine clinical practice. Eventually, in time, the pathways for regulatory review and approval will be updated to enable development of an increasingly broad range of microbiome-based therapies that reduce the burden of infectious diseases among children.","['Colonization resistance', 'gastrointestinal microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'respiratory microbiota']",2024-4-12,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,Gonorrhea
11462721,Female transactional sex workers’ experiences and health-seeking behaviour in low-middle income countries: a scoping review,"For a variety of reasons related to biology, behaviour, and environment, a subset of a population known as female sex workers (FSWs) or female transactional sex workers is at increased risk of health, depression, social stigma and access to timely and quality healthcare when needed. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there was lack of understanding regarding the experiences and healthcare utilisation and behaviours, the health burden among them, their experiences, and how they access health care. Using Anderson’s behavioural model of health service utilisation as a framework, this review aimed to explore the experiences of, and healthcare seeking behaviours of female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries. Six relevant databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed research articles published between January 1990 and December 2023 that discussed female transactional sex work in low- and middle-income countries. Subject terms such as: low-and middle- incomes, sex workers (female and male), sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the sex work industry, prostitution, commercial sex, and health-seeking behaviour were used for the databases search. Out of 6,135 articles that were retrieved for the study, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Of the total number of studies, four were reviews, eight were quantitative studies, six were qualitative studies, and two utilised mixed methods. Results from a thematic analysis of studies that combined quantitative and qualitative methods yielded six overarching themes.The study found that women engaged in sex work for different reasons – to fend for themselves (i.e., livelihood), self-employment and others do it for pleasure. However, force sex or unprotected which can lead to sexually transmitted infections, sexual abuse, job insecurity, were critical risks factors in engaging in sex work. These factors make them vulnerable to predators and health risks. It was found that sex workers were aware of the importance of seeking healthcare, and do make the efforts, however, crucial factors such as difficulty accessing healthcare and maltreatment by healthcare providers and social stigma disincentivises FSW health-seeking behaviours. Sexual workers reported discomfort disclosing their occupations because of the stigma and discrimination which further affects their regular health examinations and obtaining medically approved condoms from healthcare facilities. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare afflict female sex workers in LMICs. The maltreatment and stigma can potentially affect LMICs from achieving using health facility care, with potential implications on achieving the universal health coverage goals. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs."," Female transactional sexual behaviour is associated with public health problems worldwide and presents many conceptual challenges for researchers [ The health and well-being of female sex workers (FSWs) are greatly impacted by a number of issues and vulnerabilities that are specific to the profession in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, FSW in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should not be overlooked as a minor aspect of the social and economic crisis. Governments are becoming more aware of the problems and dangers faced by sex workers and their health-seeking activities [ In addition, the environment in which FSWs conduct their business often vary and with different experiences, thereof. According to a qualitative study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, FSWs meet clients online as well as in real-world settings like venues and outdoor areas. Due to the criminalisation of their profession, the women involved reported experiencing severe stigma, assault from customers and authorities, and difficulties getting access to healthcare. Those who used online venues faced extra dangers, including extortion and cybersecurity threats [ In urban versus rural settings, FSWs may have very different experiences. Though there is more competition and violence in urban areas; therefore, FSWs may have better access to clients and services [ However, the universal health coverage (UHC) principles are widely championed because a population’s healthcare-seeking behaviour (HSB) has a major impact on a country’s health status and, as a result, socioeconomic growth [ It includes factors such as the type of provider, adherence to treatment, reasons for choosing a professional, and reasons for not seeking help. The environment’s characteristics significantly influence individuals’ decisions to seek healthcare, with specific characteristics determining their HSBs [ The literature has shown that many FSWs face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, preferring informal providers due to fear of stigma and discrimination. Studies show that up to 70% of FSWs avoid public health facilities due to discrimination, stigma and mistreatment concerns [ This review draws on Anderson’s model of health-seeking behaviour Fig.  Health service utilization model. Source: Adapted from Saah; Andersen and Davidson [ Thus, this study aim to explore their sex work experiences and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of female sex work in LMICs, addressing the unique challenges faced by sex workers. It highlights the complexities of healthcare utilization and the social, economic, and security threats to their livelihoods, thereby enabling the development of public health efforts and interventions [ To find relevant research, this review conducted a comprehensive mapping of studies that focused on commercial or transactional sex work and the health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) of female sex workers. The following steps proposed by Arksey and O’Malley’s [ These searches were conducted using academic databases such as PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, the author conducted a thorough search for non-traditional sources of information, as well as examined the reference lists of all relevant studies that were found, in order to uncover any more research papers that align with our search criteria [ A systematic search was conducted on published literature within these popular databases in the field health, psychology and social sciences. The following keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were combined in the searches: “transactional sex work” OR “commercial sex work” “prostitute” OR “prostitution” OR “sex work” OR “sex worker” OR “female sex workers” OR “STIs” OR “health-seeking behavior” AND “low-middle income countries”. The study included studies published between 1990 and 2023. This was the period within which discussions on HIV/AIDS and STIs’ among female sex workers became prominent in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa [ Relevant components of the study aims, methods used and the findings were extracted and summarised. Out of 6,347 articles found using the database and manual search, 1,215 made it through the title and abstract screening process after duplicates were removed. After the screening, 202 studies were considered eligible for assessment, and 22 studies were ultimately selected after triangulation by three (3) separate reviewers.

 Summary of Factors 
 Summary of Factors Affecting Health Seeking Behaviour (HSB) of prostitutes Demographics and socioeconomic variables commonly identified and discussed in these studies included age, marital status, level of education, family background, ethnicity, religious backgrounds and poverty. In 80.8% ( In 19 (73.1%) studies participants identified factors that led them to female transactional sex work. FSWs indicated that the primary factor influencing their decisions to work in the area of commercial sex was that, they were from poor financial background, had no job, did not have any identifiable sources of income and found it difficult to fend for themselves [ Respondents in other studies involving FSWs in Nigeria and others in public Universities in Ghana, provided a list of reasons for entering into the sex work industry that extended beyond money or material benefits. A subset of participants in the study provided the following explanations:  From the analysis, female sex workers (FSWs) revealed that the majority of male clients exhibit resistance in regards to condom usage prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. The vulnerability of younger sex workers was heightened by their inexperience and lack of proficiency in bargaining, leading to difficulties in advocating for condom use during sexual encounters. FSWs also mentioned issues of vulnerability to extortion by state security personnel such as Police Officers, who sometimes would abuse sex workers physically, and demand unprotected sex. Most cultures in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) frown upon transactional sex work. Thus, sex workers commonly reported discomfort discussing their profession, accessing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing, and when they need approved and affordable condoms from the local health clinics [ Several studies have revealed dangers associated with violence or sexual assault perpetrated by clients. The circumstances that are thought to increase the vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to violence include visiting a client’s residence, engaging in nocturnal sessions, and meeting unfamiliar individuals at unknown locations [ The iteration of the results show that FSWs visit drinking bars and night clubs in and around urban areas at night in search of customers, whilst others operate in rented rooms (i.e. hotels, guest houses, and brothels). There were other categories such as those who provide escort services to clients. These categories are highly paid female sex work and involve sexual encounters by appointment with an exclusive client. Such FSWs leave their mobile phone contacts and pictures in hotels and guest houses in, and around their respective areas of operations, to be contacted by prospective customers in Mainland China, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria and similar LMICs [ Studies maintain that once they are selling sex, they are also trying to avoid abuse from clients and law enforcement agencies, such Police Officers. It was found that FSWs sought love and to build a future. Therefore, FSW indulge in romantic relationships with young men without prior medical screening for health status including sexually transmitted infections [ Analysis of factors influencing health-seeking behaviours (HSBs) was based on Andersen’s behavioural model of healthcare utilisation [ Andersen indicates that although predisposing and enabling factors are necessary for health service utilisation, they are not sufficient explanations for “actual use” of healthcare. “Actual use” is initiated by need, which might arise as a result of level of the health condition [ In this study, enabling factors at the female sex worker (FSW) level included wealth and income at the her disposal to cover the cost of assuming positive health-related lifestyles such as good nutrition, physical exercising, wearing of condom, engaging in other safe sex practices and good personal hygiene [ At the individual FSWs level, the model differentiates between perceived need for health services, which refers to how individuals perceive and experience their own health status (such as self-rated health, functional state, and illness symptoms), evaluated need, which involves objective measurements of FSWs’ health status, health screening, and need for health care [ The enhanced healthcare seeking behaviour among FSWs can be attributed to their apprehension of developing the intricate type of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their increased awareness about health, as shown in studies in Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and other LMICs [ Two articles reported that women engaged in street-based sex work, whether separated or married, were more likely to seek health services from clinics or hospitals, when compared to those who were not or never married [ The study aimed to synthesize existing findings on female sex workers experiences, survival strategies, and health-seeking behaviours in low- and middle-income countries. The findings revealed that female sex workers had a high level of formal education, were primarily between the ages of 12 and 35, were either gainfully employed in other sectors or unemployed, and had financial needs. Female sex workers (FSWs) who were married or separated showed an increased likelihood of seeking healthcare. However, FSWs faced challenges in seeking healthcare due to derogatory and discriminatory behaviours towards them, high healthcare fees, and discrimination and maltreatment from providers. Generally, the majority of women involved in transactional sex work experience various degrees of vulnerability. Thus, FSWs’ increased awareness of health concerns and their desire to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) motivated them to seek healthcare. Some FSWs engaged in the act to earn a living, while others primarily engaged in sex work for the fun of it. The majority of the studies examined indicate that most women engaged in sex work at the age of 12 or older had received some level of formal education. These women faced a lack of opportunities to earn income, and many considered dropping out of school as a pivotal moment in their lives, which aligns with existing literature [ First, male clients’ non-adherence and prioritisation of heath protection. Crucial concerns of their health was high, due to clients’ refusal, and deliberate uncooperative attitude towards condom usage during sexual service provision, and incidents of violence. It is worth noting that clients’ refusal to cherish and use sexual protection was closely linked to ‘power and control imbalances’ in the transactional sex work business, as well as the ‘terms’ of ‘contract’ between commercial sex workers and their male clients. From the results, the male clientele tends to exert more dominance in the entire negotiation process. In this context, the use of condoms during transactional sexual interactions is an essential aspect. A quick scan of the literature demonstrates that unprotected sex exposes the lives of FSWs and their clients, to STIs including HIV. Indeed, there was high HIV prevalence in the sex work industry. For example, in 2012, the World Bank report on the health of sex workers showed that across all regions, HIV prevalence was 11.8%, and 36.9% in sub-Saharan Africa, with Malawi (70.7%), South Africa (59.6%), Kenya (45.1%), Rwanda (24.0%) [ Second, health and bodily security were crucial findings from literature. The findings have shown that FSWs were susceptible to multiple problems of health risks, violence and physical harm. Indeed, concerns relative to sexual violence, rape, condom failure, and instances of police officers’ misconduct, were mentioned. These led to concerns of anxiety about contracting HIV through rape and unprotected sex [ Female sex workers faced multiple human rights violations. The results have shown that issues of discrimination and class concerns existed and how women’s bodies were turned into commodities for distinct ulterior motives. Indeed, increased criminalization and social stigmatisation, potentially leading to further discrimination from health providers, hindered their access and utilisation of health facility care [ Finally, the study found that FSWs felt compelled to use healthcare, aligning with Andersen’s healthcare usage model. In nearly all of the included articles, FSWs showed increased health awareness and self-reported health screening in locations such as Mainland China [ Key strength of the study stems from its geographical coverage and the wide duration which allowed saturation of data on the themes. The study also included articles from The study was guided by Anderson’s healthcare utilisation model; meanwhile different frameworks were used to analyse female sex workers experiences and health seeking behaviours in the included studies. The subject investigated has cultural and health implications, and thus, the non-inclusion of cultural nuances in the search may have left out relevant articles. However, given the saturation of the findings in the themes, it is believed, additional articles may only support what has been found. Despite the novel findings presented in this study, they must be read against the backdrop of the following limitations. The review investigates the experiences of female sex workers, and their health-seeking behaviours in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, it does not (and cannot) address all of the concerns with geographical distinctiveness in low- and middle-income countries in one study. Further, some articles were not available in full text or freely accessible via search engines for inclusion in the data set. However, the anticipated effect of non-access to the full texts, which are less likely to be published in low impact factor journals, may be to add only a number of supporting articles to the already established themes. Finally, female sex work has shifted from traditional brothel-based sex work to internet-based sex work and a mix of different types, over the last years. The vulnerabilities faced by women in sex work depend on the type of sex work they are engaged in, whether it’s brothel-based, street-based, massage parlour-based, internet-based, or other forms of transactional sex. However, this study could not explore these nuances, which has limited the conclusions relative to the vulnerabilities across the broad spectrum of female sex work. This study recommends further studies in these areas for policy, social intervention and health programming. The review’s findings validate several notions outlined in Anderson’s health seeking model, specifically that socio-demographic factors like education, occupation (particularly sex work), and the effectiveness of medications or pharmaceuticals are inadequate for determining the utilisation of conventional healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, the utilisation of orthodox health facilities by FSWs was not significantly influenced by age or marital status. The study also discovered a noteworthy relationship between the vocation of sex work and the practice of self-medication. Variables such as age, education, marital status, work status, and work experience did not show a significant correlation with self-medication from the literature. The findings have shown that female sex work in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents complex policy challenges with significant implications for public health, human rights, and social welfare. Overall, policies regarding female sex work in LMICs should prioritize the rights, health, and well-being of sex workers while addressing the broader social, economic, and structural factors that shape their experiences. Complex challenges rooted in economic vulnerability, social marginalisation, and limited access to healthcare services was found to negatively impact female sex workers in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was found that female sex work was motivated by the need to earn living although others engaged in the business for the love it. Nevertheless, FSWs were exposed to multiple risks of sexually transmitted infections, threats of sexual and physical violence against them, as well as human rights violations from clients and law enforcement agencies. Indeed, access to health facility for healthcare become problematic due to discrimination and stigma by healthcare providers. The maltreatment and stigma meted to FSWs, potentially inhibits their health outcomes, the countries attainment of universal health coverage goals, and without access to care for FSWs, HIV could become an endemic health problem. Comprehensive, rights-based strategies that address structural injustices and empower these women to live healthier, more secure lives are necessary to address their special needs. Furthermore, to address the factors relative to healthcare seeking behaviours of FSWs, there is an urgent wake-up call to ensure comprehensive, non-discriminatory, and accessible healthcare is available to improve their healthcare utilisation.","['Commercial sex work', 'Prostitution', 'Transactional sex', 'Low-middle income countries']",2024-10-9,BMC Public Health,Gonorrhea

11457904,Self-reported sexually transmitted infections and associated risk factors among female university students,"The spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an ongoing public health challenge, and awareness of risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive interventions. This study aimed to assess self-reported STI occurrences and identify risk factors and sexual behaviors associated with STIs among female university students. This is a cross-sectional, online questionnaire study, including 384 female university students seeking contraceptive counseling at a gynecology clinic in Uppsala, Sweden, and reporting having had sex. Associated risk factors and behaviors were assessed by comparing those who reported STIs and those who did not. The mean age of participants was 22.8 years. Seventy-eight (20%) had contracted at least one STI, with seven (9%) experiencing multiple infections. Seventy-three (94%) reported first-date sexual activity without a condom among STI experienced. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most common STI pathogen (68% of all infections), followed by Herpes simplex virus (18%) and Mycoplasma genitalium (13%). Behavioral factors associated with self-reported STIs were first-date sexual activity without a condom, not using condom at first intercourse, younger age at first intercourse, a higher number of sexual partners overall and in the last 12 months, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regretting sexual activity after substance use ( Condom use was low among the respondents, and STIs were common regardless of the high level of education in this group. Contraceptive counseling needs to highlight the importance of condom use in addition to contraceptive efficacy. It is also essential to consider the specific risk factors and behaviors prevalent among young adults to reduce the spread of STIs.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a common problem worldwide and present various challenges regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prevention in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Most STIs are not life-threatening, but they can still lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and fetal and neonatal morbidity ( University students can be considered especially vulnerable to contracting an STI, as partying, including binge drinking and recreational drug use, is a common and normalized behavior in campus culture ( Studies about sexual behavior and the use of contraceptives among female university students in Uppsala have been conducted regularly since 1989 ( Uppsala is a Swedish university city with about 50,000 students. Swedish-speaking women who visited an outpatient gynecology clinic for contraceptive counseling were asked to participate. Data collection took place between February and June 2023. Previously, only university students could visit this clinic, which was designated as the student healthcare clinic. From 2014 onward, it became open to all women. When attending the clinic, women were invited to participate and received information about the study along with a QR link to the survey. The survey was conducted via REDCap ( No ethical permission was needed since the study participants were anonymous, and no sensitive personal information could be linked to any individual (advisory opinion, Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 219-04587). Since this was a follow-up study, the questionnaire was mostly identical to those used in previous studies ( Statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 29.0.2.0) and R (version 4.2.3). Continuous and discrete variables were analyzed using T-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U-test for skewed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test when there were too few observations for Pearson’s chi-square test. Proportions of STIs are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Clopper-Pearsons exact CIs. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and testing multiple characteristics, we set the level of statistical significance at 0.003 in accordance with the Bonferroni correction method (0.05/20 = 0.0025 ≈ 0.003). In total, 599 persons answered the questionnaire. As this study focuses on university students, those who stated that they worked, went to upper secondary school, or did not answer the question about occupation were excluded from further analyses. In addition, we only included participants reporting having had sex. Thus, 384 women studying at the university remained, and the background characteristics of these are presented in  Background characteristics of study participants ( Out of the 384 study participants, 78 (20%, 95% CI 16.4 – 24.7%) had experienced at least one STI, and seven (9%, 95% CI 3.7 – 17.6%) of them reported a history of more than one STI. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most commonly occurring STI; see  Self-reported STI pathogens among female university students ( The percentage of STI pathogens adds up to 106.3% because seven females reported more than one pathogen Characteristics and sexual behavior related to STI status among female university students. Among those who reported having had anal sex ( Comparison of those who have had an STI with those who have not T-test, Pearson’s chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test Of the respondents, 20% had experienced an STI, and 9% of these had experienced multiple STIs. Both of these estimates were nominally lower than in the previous survey from 2014, when 26% reported one STI and 17% of these reported multiple STIs ( It is possible that the tendency toward a reduction in STI occurrence can be partly explained by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sweden, the Public Health Agency issued recommendations such as limiting close contacts and keeping a distance from others to limit the spread of the virus ( A significant difference in the number of sexual partners was observed between women with and without experience of an STI, with more sexual partners in the STI group, in line with previous studies ( Dating app usage and meeting sexual partners online have been associated with sexual risk behavior ( Among those who reported experiencing an STI, it was more than twice as common to report having ‘regretted sexual activity after substance use’ compared to those without STI experience. Finally, considering the risk of contracting an STI, it is worrying that more than half of all students and almost all the students in the STI group have experienced first-date sexual activity without a condom. As recruitment took place at a gynecology clinic, our study does not capture those using only condom and hence not needing an appointment to obtain a prescription. This might affect the low rate of condom use. However, condom use is always recommended with new partners despite the use of other contraceptives. It cannot be excluded that the low numbers are also affected by impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption, as one-night stands often occur after a night out. However, non-use of condom was not statistically significantly associated with STIs in all situations. This suggests that other risk behaviors besides sex without a condom are more important for STI risk, as one can behave responsibly, for example, by getting tested before having sex with a new partner and therefore not using a condom. With its cross-sectional design, this study only provides information on associations between known variables. Nonetheless, it is a good-sized sample from a clearly defined population and offers valuable insights into factors associated with STIs among university students. We also set a conservative significance level, safeguarding against false positives and overinterpretation of the results. Additionally, the high internal response rate further strengthens the study. All recruited participants attended the same gynecological clinic, which may indicate a certain sociodemographic group and cause selection bias. On the other hand, the clinic’s central location and popularity among students facilitated effective recruitment. Condom-only users rarely visit a clinic for contraceptive counseling, which may also contribute to selection bias. Participation in the study was anonymous, which we considered important to minimize the risk of social desirability bias, as most of the questions were on sensitive topics. A potential downside of anonymity is that we could not examine the representativeness of the sample, and there is a risk of non-response bias if those who declined participation represent a specific group. Furthermore, all the data collected were self-reported retrospectively, making recall bias likely to some extent since a person’s ability to accurately recall past events deteriorates with time. The reliability of self-reported diagnoses depends on many factors, including the type of condition, question design, and participant understanding. With self-reported diagnoses, it is impossible to know if the person truly had the disease and had it verified by healthcare professionals or merely self-diagnosed. Particularly in the case of STIs, which carry stigma, accurate reporting may be further compromised. Altogether, this might contribute to an underestimated STI occurrence. This study’s findings contribute to the existing literature on STIs and sexual risk behaviors, which is crucial for designing preventive measures and promoting sexual health among young adults. Despite efforts to prevent STIs, poor condom use remains a persistent problem, especially among dating app users and those under the influence of alcohol. While this study does not delve into the reasons behind the lack of condom use, further research in this area is essential to identify specific barriers and develop targeted interventions. Future studies should continue to monitor STI occurrence beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as the digital age and widespread use of dating apps may change people’s sexual habits and behaviors. The identified risk factors and behaviors for contracting an STI included younger age at first intercourse, a greater number of sexual partners, not using condom at first intercourse, first-date sexual activity without a condom, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regret of sexual activity after substance use. Despite the high level of education in this group, there was a worrying occurrence of STIs and a lack of condom use, especially under the influence of alcohol. These risk factors and behaviors should be considered when planning prevention efforts in this demographic group, and continuous promotion of condom use should be prioritized, especially in a risk context.","['Sexually transmitted diseases', 'sexual behavior', 'unsafe sex', 'sexual health', 'young adult']",2024-9-30,Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences,Gonorrhea
11457556,"Experiences of harm and mental ill-health among gay, bisexual and other men-who-have-sex-with-men who use methamphetamine or GHB/GBL in different combinations: findings from the COMeT study in Taiwan","Polydrug use in the context of chemsex is commonplace among gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM). This study aimed to examine the differences in experiences of physical, social, and psychological harms, as well as mental ill-health among GBMSM who use different combinations of methamphetamine and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL) during chemsex. Adult GBMSM participants who had experience of chemsex in the past 12 months participated in a cross-sectional online survey in Taiwan and self-reported their sociodemographic background, sexual behaviours, mental health, and experiences of harm following a chemsex session. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess the different experiences of harm and mental ill-health among GBMSM who engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and who used both drugs. Out of 510 participants who completed all items included in the analysis, 24.1% engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, 36.9% used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and 39.0% used both drugs. Eighty five percent of men who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL reported at least one kind of social harm after a chemsex session, such as missing dates or appointments, or appearing “high” at work, followed by used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL (69.7%) and those without using methamphetamine (37.4%). After controlling for polydrug and frequency of drug use in the multivariable logistic regression, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing physical and psychological harms compared to those who did not use methamphetamine ( GBMSM who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in a chemsex context were more likely to report experience of harms than those who only used a single chemsex drug or engaged in chemsex without methamphetamine or GHB/GBL. Harm reduction should focus on both preventing HIV and STI transmission and on minimising psychosocial harm to GBMSM, with varying impacts depending on drug use.","Chemsex is a form of sexualized drug use, broadly defined by the use of methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL), or mephedrone during or before sexual activities to enhance sexual pleasure or performance in gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM) [ Most studies have taken a broad approach to examining chemsex practices, often analyzing drug use as a single group without adequately exploring individual substances or focusing solely on polydrug use without examining potential synergistic interactions. Some studies have focused on only a single chemsex drug, such as methamphetamine or GHB/GBL [ Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL act differently upon the central nervous system (CNS) and can be associated with different harms, possibly due to their pharmacological properties [ Given the different characteristics of methamphetamine and GHB/GBL, as outlined above, it is necessary to separately examine the association of these two main drugs of chemsex with mental health and harms. This paper examines the following: (1) differences in the sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and reported STI diagnoses, and (2) differences in physical, social, and psychological experiences of harm associated with chemsex for GBMSM who use GHB/GBL and/or methamphetamine. The Chemsex Online Survey for Men who Have Sex with Men in Taiwan (COMeT) was an anonymous cross-sectional online study that investigated the characteristics of harm in chemsex scenarios among GBMSM in Taiwan [ All participants reported whether they had engaged in chemsex or sexualized-related drug use in the past 6 months with any of the following substances: MDMA, prescribed sedative drugs (such as Stilnox), amyl nitrite, erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs, ketamine, methamphetamine, 5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-meo), alcohol, marijuana, mephedrone, GHB/GBL, cocaine, and “coffee-pack” (a pack of mixed substances with unknown ingredients). Participants were originally categorised into four groups based on their use (+) or not use (−) of methamphetamine (M) and/or GHB/GBL (G) in the past 6 months: M−G−, M−G+, M+G− and M+G+. Given that the proportion of M﻿−G+ participants ( Polydrug use was defined as the use of drugs excluding methamphetamine, GHB/GBL, alcohol, and ED drugs from the list of drugs in the survey. Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were excluded due to multicollinearity. The frequency of using methamphetamine or GHB/GBL was assessed in separate questions by asking how often they used methamphetamine or GHB/GBL on a nine-point Likert scale from “daily” to “never.” We included age (20–29, 30–39, and > 39 years old), education (college or below, college graduate, and above college), and monthly income (< 15 kilos [K] New Taiwan dollars [NTD], 15–30 K NTD, and > 30 K NTD; 1 United States dollar [USD] ≅ 30 NTD). We asked each participant to report the number of sexual partners they had in the previous 12 months and categorised them as < 3, 3–5, 6–9, or > 9 partners. We also asked about their frequency of using condoms in a chemsex context in the past three months and categorised them as inconsistent (i.e., not always) and consistent (i.e., always). We combined the self-reported status of HIV and PrEP uptake in the past three months in a single variable and categorised it as HIV negative on PrEP, HIV negative but not on PrEP, and HIV positive. Self-reported STIs in the past 12 months, including gonorrhea, syphilis, anal and penile warts, genital herpes, amoebic colitis, chlamydia, shigellosis, and hepatitis virus infection (including type A, B, and C virus) were categorised into none and any. All participants were asked whether they had experienced a range of issues following a chemsex session and were presented with a 17-item checklist. Items were categorised into physical (such as eating problems or missing PrEP or HIV drugs), social (such as having difficulty getting out of bed or absence from work, etc.), and psychological (such as auditory hallucination or paranoid, etc.) experiences. We included four indicators of mental health: mood-related problems, suicide ideation, loneliness, and sexual well-being. Mood-related problems was measured by the Taiwan version of the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5, Cronbach’s alpha: 0.77–0.90) on a scale of 0–4 [ We conducted chi-square tests for descriptive statistics (including frequencies and proportions) to compare different mixed drugs groups (M−, M+G−, and M+G+) on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, the status of STIs, experiences of harm after a chemsex session and mental health. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations among different mixed drug groups and experiences of harm after a chemsex session. We set the alpha level at 0.05 and adjusted the alpha level for the multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni’s method (altered alpha level = original alpha divided by the number of dependent variables). All data were analysed by Intercooled STATA software version 15.0 (College Station, TX).

Nearly half of the participants (44.7%) had experienced at least one STI diagnosis in the last 12 months, excluding HIV (M+G+: 59.3%, M+G−: 44.7%, and M﻿−: 21.1%).

Even though suicidal ideation and mood-related problems were significant in univariable analysis comparing M+G+ and M−, they were not significant in Models 2 and 3 when polydrug use and frequency were further adjusted (see Table  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to distinguish and compare the profile of harm and mental health among GBMSM who engage in mixed patterns of chemsex drug use (i.e., methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL). The users of methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL showed no difference in their sociodemographic characteristics but there were differences in sexual behaviour, HIV status, and the recent diagnosis of an STI. Even after controlling for polydrug, frequency of drug use, and other potentially confounding variables, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing different categories of harm compared to those who did not use methamphetamine. Mental health, loneliness, suicidal ideation and sexual well-being were not different among the three drug combination groups in multivariable analysis. GBMSM in the M+G+ group were most likely to report almost all kinds of harm following a chemsex session. Moreover, the risk of experiencing every kind of harm followed a decreasing gradient from GBMSM in the M+G+, M+G−, and M− groups. Our findings revealed that people who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were most likely to report nearly every kind of harm after a chemsex session. Studies have found that the simultaneous use of drugs with opposite mechanisms (i.e., using CNS stimulant with CNS depressant) was associated with more toxic drug interactions than using a single drug, such as using ketamine with caffeine, using cocaine with alcohol, or using cocaine with heroin (also known as “Speedball”) [ It is worth noting that we found significant differences between M+G+ and M− in each type of harm after we further controlled for polydrug and frequency of using drug. This may reflect that beyond the effects of polydrug and frequency, the pattern of using drugs (i.e., using both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL) itself was still one of the important factors that was associated with different kinds of harm. On the other hand, the physical and psychological harm between M+G− and M− was still significant after controlling for polydrug and the frequency of using drug, but the social harm is no longer significant after controlling for the frequency. This may reflect that physical and psychological harm are related to the pattern of drug use (i.e., using methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL); however, social harm, which has a wider impact, may be partly explained by the frequency of using a drug rather than the type of drug use or polydrug. Although one study showed that polydrug and methamphetamine use were both associated with high risk of HIV infection and condomless sex [ Research has documented an association between the use of methamphetamine or GHB/GBL and condomless sex with nonsteady partners [ There were some limitations in this study. First, participants in this study were recruited through one specific popular app used by GBMSM in Taiwan. This might potentially lead to missing those who engaged in chemsex on other apps or channels. Second, our study sample included very few people of M−G+; however, this might reflect the actual situation of the Taiwanese GBMSM chemsex population. Since we merged M−G+ and M−G− into the M− group, it was hard to detect the distinct profile of harm experiences and mental health of those in the M−G+ group. Future studies may make extra effort to recruit more M−G+ users. Third, there might still exist some confounding variables that were not assessed in this study, such as participants' specific psychiatric diagnosis, which could affect their profiles on harm experiences and mental health. Fourth, we did not know for sure whether men were using the mixture of GHB and methamphetamine on the occasion that they experienced harms after the chemsex session. Future study should collect information at the event level and context of the chemsex. For example, a recent study found that in a cohort of young sexual minority men, same-day use of methamphetamine use was most commonly occurred with cannabis and GHB [ Research studies have rarely discussed the social harm following a chemsex session. Most studies about chemsex-related social harms have taken a relatively general, sociological, or macroscopic perspective and focused on the social stigma or damage to relationships [ Our study revealed that the profile of harm and mental health varied among groups of GBMSM who engaged in chemsex using different combinations of drugs. Typologies of drug use and mixed usage may be key factors differentiating the experience of harm and the interventions that are required to support GBMSM towards safer drug use.","['Gay-bisexual-and-other-men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM)', 'Chemsex', 'Methamphetamine', 'Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)', 'Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)', 'Harm reduction']",2024-10-7,Harm Reduction Journal,Gonorrhea

11455243,Pioneering Physician: Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell and the Path to Medical History,"Elizabeth Blackwell was a remarkable and courageous woman who made significant contributions to medicine, education, and the rights of women. Blackwell achieved significant milestones in the medical field by being the first female physician in America and the first woman to be listed on the United Kingdom medical register. Despite facing challenges, discrimination, and barriers, she founded the London School of Medicine and the New York Infirmary for Women and Children to provide better education and health benefits for women and children. She lived during a time when women were expected to stay in the home; yet, she went on to become a doctor and professor.","This article aims to highlight the remarkable achievements of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, a trailblazing figure in the medical field and the most powerful American woman in Bristol. She made history by becoming the first American woman to graduate with a medical degree. In 1859, Blackwell achieved another milestone by being the first woman to be officially registered with the medical register of the British General Medical Council. Blackwell was a pioneer who launched several leading-edge health programs, played a key role in numerous reform initiatives, and dedicated her life to improving healthcare. She significantly advanced the education and acquisition of female physicians in the United States [ Artist: Elliott and Fry Source: National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution [ Early life and education Elizabeth Blackwell was born in Bristol, England, on February 3, 1821. In 1832, when Dr. Blackwell was just 11, her father's business failed, and her family relocated to the United States. Following a period spent in New York, they moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1835, and later settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1838 [ The journey Even for men, choosing to become a physician was not an easy decision during the 1840s. At the time, human health was generally poor. A concurrent rise in disease transmission was caused by the development of cities next to polluted water sources, a lack of facilities for the disposal of waste, and a large vermin population. Without a clear cause, diseases like cholera, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and influenza spread quickly. The germ hypothesis of disease had not yet been proposed by Louis Pasteur [ To ascertain someone or an organization willing to give an opportunity to teach a woman in medical science, Blackwell began calling physicians and medical schools. She wrote to several family friends who were physicians, and every one of them responded in the same way. In her autobiography, she recalled, ""They all shared a similar view that, although the idea was valuable, it could not be carried out; that a woman could not receive such an education; that the required education was lengthy and costly; that there were many barriers in the way of such a course; and that, in short, the idea, though valuable, could not be executed."" A medical degree was particularly challenging because of the unstable financial situation of the Blackwell family. Blackwell was supported by the profits from her father's sugar plant while growing up in England and then New York. However, her father passed away in 1838, not long after the family had moved to Cincinnati, leaving his wife and nine children with only $20 in his bank account [ While Elizabeth was in her mid-20s, her close companion passed away following a long ailment. Her ill friend expressed that she would not have suffered as much if she had been allowed to see a female physician. This was the tipping point when Elizabeth decided to devote her career to studying medicine and assisting women in accessing high-quality healthcare. She spent a few years studying medicine in private before applying to Geneva Medical College. The college took the opinion of male students into account as well, to decide the acceptance of Elizabeth's application. Elizabeth enrolled in medical school when the students voted ""yes,"" and she made history by becoming the first female to be registered in the British General Medical Council [ Talk of the town Blackwell faced racial discrimination during her college days. She was forced to sit in a separate row by her professors and was often prevented from attending labs, while the community frequently humiliated her as she pursued her education and career goals against the prevailing customs and culture. In 1849, Blackwell finally proved herself to her teachers and companions by ranking first in the class. Although doctors had advised her to restrict herself only to midwifery or nursing training, she nonetheless pursued both fields in London and Paris hospitals. Faced with male doctors who consistently failed to practice better hygiene by not washing their hands while treating patients, she became more interested in preventive care and personal hygiene, as these are crucial aspects of maintaining overall health and well-being. Despite being the only female medical student at the school, she was the talk of the town, and other women disapproved of her for challenging gender norms [ Blackwell’s academic success Elizabeth conducted an observational study at Blockley Almshouse in Philadelphia during the spring and summer semester break. Although she obtained approval from the regulatory agency to observe patients and medical personnel, she faced resistance from the resident physicians, who declined to collaborate with her. Blockley Almshouse served as a treatment centre for the city's most vulnerable population, including impoverished individuals and Irish immigrants suffering from typhus, also known as ""ship fever."" Elizabeth's thesis, based on her observations and research, was highly acclaimed and selected for publication in the Buffalo Medical Journal, a prestigious scientific platform [ Challenges and barriers In April, after obtaining her naturalization as a citizen of the United States, Blackwell moved to England in May to pursue additional training, and in June, she enrolled in La Maternité's midwifery program in Paris. She contracted an infectious condition of the eyes while attending to a newborn who had an eye infection caused by bacteria - most likely gonorrhoea acquired from the baby's mother during delivery - which rendered one of her eyes blind and forced her to give up on her aim of being a surgeon. She moved back to England in October 1850 and began working for Dr. (later Sir) James Paget at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. She returned to New York in 1851, but this time, she was turned down for jobs in the city's hospitals and pharmacies and was unable to even afford private consulting rooms. Her private practice took a long time to develop, so she authored a lecture series that was eventually published in 1852 as  Key achievements First Women-Managed Infirmary in the United States Dr. Blackwell had the dispensary extended into the New York Infirmary for Women and Children. In 1857, she transitioned from operating a part-time dispensary with limited services to establishing the New York Infirmary for impoverished women and children, a comprehensive healthcare facility offering round-the-clock care for medical and surgical patients. This innovative healthcare institution had a dual mission: first, to provide accessible healthcare services to underserved populations, and second, to serve as a professional development hub for female physicians, medical students, and nursing scholars, addressing the gender gap in medical education and practice. By providing a dedicated training environment, the infirmary aimed to enhance the skills and expertise of women in healthcare, promoting gender equality in the medical field [ Providing Women With a Safe Environment to Study Elizabeth advocated for women, arguing that they should study medicine in the same recognized institutions as men. She recognized a gender-based admission bias in medical colleges, which hindered female professionals' education. This led her to set up a women's medical college, addressing systemic inequality. Her initiative promoted gender inclusivity in medical education. When the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary first opened its doors in 1868, it had 15 students and 9 teaching members, including Emily, Elizabeth's younger sister, who was a professor of obstetrics and women's disorders, and Elizabeth, who was a professor of hygiene. The college was managed by Emily after Elizabeth moved to England the year after it opened. Having always intended to pursue her profession in England, she left New York in 1869 and spent the next 40 years there [ Emphasized Women's Health and Hygiene Elizabeth Blackwell emphasized the importance of cleanliness and public health throughout her career as a means of preventing illness and enhancing overall well-being. She was an outspoken supporter of hygiene, sanitation, and preventive medicine [ Establishment of the National Health Society In 1871, Elizabeth contributed to the establishment of the National Health Society, a prominent organization dedicated to promoting public health. She also successfully developed a thriving private medical practice, demonstrating her clinical expertise. Furthermore, in 1875, she was appointed as a professor of gynaecology at the London School of Medicine for Women, a prestigious academic institution. This appointment recognized her authority in the field of gynaecology and enabled her to share her knowledge and experience with future generations of female medical professionals, contributing to the advancement of women in medicine and the development of obstetric and gynaecologic care [ It is remarkable that, at the time of Dr. Blackwell's death in 1910, women made up about 6% of American physicians. By 2021, women accounted for 35% of practising physicians and more than half of medical students in the United States [ A Deft Musician Before pursuing medicine, Blackwell showcased her musical talent by teaching at an academy in North Carolina, using her musical skills to fund her education. This lesser-known aspect of her life highlights her multifaceted abilities, revealing a talented musician behind the renowned physician [ Elizabeth Blackwell’s pioneering spirit, courage, and dedication to her craft have left an indelible mark on the history of medicine. Despite facing numerous obstacles, she made a great contribution to advocating for women’s admission to medical school, fighting for the rights of women and gender equality, as well as emphasizing public health and hygiene. She was the first woman who inspired other women to pursue medical careers. Her contributions toward better health will forever be remembered and celebrated.","['gender equality', 'health reform', 'historical vignette', 'medical education', 'women physician']",,Cureus,Gonorrhea
11451726,"The potential of a hygiene-based message, preferred learning modalities, and *iLubricarte, Liberarte, Lavarte+!” or L 3 + for the prevention of HIV/STI in Peru","Hygiene-based practices of lubrication, genital cleansing, postcoital urination, and rectal douching are common behaviors among populations at higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infections (STI). Yet, the role these behaviors have on HIV/STI risk has not been well elucidated, especially among transgender women (TW) and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Additionally, advances in biomedical strategies have heralded a new era of HIV/AIDS prevention that may be accompanied by behavioral changes that lead to decreases in condom usage and subsequent changes to STI sequelae. Nevertheless, many people at higher risk are not benefiting equally from these options, strengthening the need for more sustainable, evidence-based methods. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices, proven preventative methods, and preferred learning methods among Peruvian TW and GBMSM. 30 interviews and 50 questionnaires were conducted with TW (N=35), GBMSM (N=35), healthcare providers (N=5), and key community informants (N=5). Most participants perceived hygiene-based practices to be common behaviors and a significant aspect of sexual wellbeing. Educational materials utilizing social media and hosting in-person events were also viewed favorably, with value to enhancing HIV/STI knowledge. Several barriers to autonomy surfaced in the data, including systemic disparities to adequate HIV/STI services, top vs. bottom social dynamics, and PrEP accessibility issues. Continued work is needed to address the barriers to the acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of hygiene-based practices, biomedical/barrier strategies, and ","Hygiene-based and other related practices in people assigned male at birth is a forgotten area of research that may prove to be important for HIV/STI prevention [ Understanding common behaviors and attitudes that impact sexual health is essential to inform the development of effective sexual health interventions [ Utilizing a mixed methods research design, this formative project was an exploratory study between November 2022 and December 2023 that primarily assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and proven biomedical/barriers strategies of Peruvian TW and GBMSM. Preferences for learning and educational messaging modalities were also explored to inform the conceptualization of a future intervention in close collaboration with proven biomedical and barrier strategies. Participants were recruited from public health centers, initially at  The eligibility criteria for TW and GBMSM included  A mix of TW (N = 10), GBMSM (N = 10), HCPs (N = 5), and KCIs (N = 5) were first asked to schedule and participate in a face-to-face, semi-structured interview in safe spaces of affiliated organizations. The themes used in the interviews were referenced from the Information-Motivation-Behavioral (IMB) Model, the Health Belief Model, and the core components of acceptability and feasibility [ Following a preliminary analysis of the interview transcripts, TW (N = 25) and GBMSM (N = 25) were asked to complete an online, self-completed questionnaire via  First-generating descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the questionnaires and describe the characteristics of our sample. Most questions were scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Some questions were open-ended, and to further personalize one’s response, participants could choose multiple answer choices and input a typed response. Answer choices of all open-ended questions were randomized to decrease bias. All participants had the option to refuse to answer any question. Thematic analysis techniques were employed to code and analyze the interviews. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, translated from Peruvian Spanish to English, coded, and analyzed. The coding framework developed to elicit the themes within each interview was consistently refined and systematically reviewed as it applied to the data. 36% (18/50) of survey participants completed secondary or technical school, and 14% (7/50) completed university. 41% (20/49) of participants were unemployed, and 65% (28/43) made under S/1000 a month. 45% (21/47) lived alone, and 42% (21/50) shared bathroom facilities (such as a toilet, sink, or shower) at least most of the time with household or community members. 26% (13/50) felt it would be at least somewhat difficult to get the support they need from others (such as friends, family, and HCPs) to practice HIV-preventative methods.
 “I have testimonies from boys and girls here who tell me that the nurse told me that the ampoule I am going to give you is going to hurt, but that happens because you do things you shouldn’t do” Many interview participants described significant, unaddressed inequities experienced among local TW and GBMSM. These disparities ranged from inattention, inactivity, stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization in many aspects of life. There is also awareness of sociopolitical disparities faced by TW that result in insecurities in health care, education, income, and nutrition. Because of these disparities and more, a few recognized that sex work was the only means of survival for most TW. Many TW expressed themselves as feeling isolated, excluded, and completely vulnerable to the disinterest of the Peruvian government and most of its citizens. In the last 3 months, the majority (76%, 38/50) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of condoms within reach, with 82% (41/50) reporting that they will at least most likely use condoms every time during sexual intercourse. 86% (42/49) of participants were aware of PrEP, but 78% (39/50) had never taken it before. The most common reasons why participants did not use PrEP included 13 participants not having access to PrEP-related services, 12 participants not knowing about the use and benefits of PrEP, and 5 participants expressing concern about potential side effects associated with PrEP use. 3 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from healthcare personnel, and 2 participants reported not using PrEP partly due to recommendation(s) from family, friends, or colleagues. Among the participants who have taken PrEP before, 55% (6/11) were at least most likely to have an adequate supply of PrEP pills. Among those who haven’t used PrEP before, 76% (26/34) are willing to take PrEP every day if proven to reduce HIV risk by at least 90%, and 74% (26/35) are willing to take PrEP every day if it is proven to have few or no side effects. If participants were to hypothetically take PrEP every day, 60% (21/35) would expect to use condoms with the same frequency as before, with 29% (10/35) expecting to use condoms at least less frequently. 53% (18/34) would expect to have about the same number of sexual partners as before, with 21% (7/34) expecting to have at least more sexual partners.
 “… there are many people who are afraid to go buy a condom at the pharmacy or the stigma that they put on us just by hearing the word “condom” because we live in a purely religious country both Catholic and Christian, evangelical and always the subject of condoms, the name condom already sounds strong. It has happened to me, I speak personally, that sometimes I tell a boy: “hey go buy a condom at the pharmacy.” And he tells me: “go buy it yourself.” So, from there I see the connotation that the same gay boys are ashamed to buy a condom in a pharmacy right?… So, I feel that there should be a campaign to remove that fear by saying condom, [because] that it’s like buying gum or going to buy a cigarette, a beer… But, I think we could do with expanding it a little more to include all these little extra things that can help, and the new forms of prevention that are also coming out: PreP, post-exposure [PEP], and all that stuff. I believe that we should give a more extensive, more comprehensive approach to everything that is prevention and not just limit ourselves to saying: “no, just use your condom, use your condom.” Many interview participants reported accessibility issues with PrEP. A few expressed concerns with the side effects associated with PrEP and ART. Some questioned why the Peruvian government hasn’t sponsored public health initiatives that destigmatize condoms and demonstrate the proper techniques of condom usage with water-based lubrication. Many considered hygiene-based practices with the use of condoms and PrEP as an important strategy to reduce the transmission and acquisition of HIV/STI. In the last 3 months, 93% (40/43) cleansed themselves at least most of the time after intercourse. 88% (43/49) were at least most likely to have regular access to a sink or shower with running water after sex. 74% (31/42) typically cleansed themselves within 15 minutes after intercourse. 69% (29/42) cleansed for at least 2 minutes. After washing, 19% (8/43) reported genital wetness. 22 participants used antibacterial soap, 11 used bar soap, and 8 used shampoo to cleanse themselves. 41 participants cleansed to become more hygienic, 19 cleansed to increase their peace of mind, 13 cleansed to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI, and 9 cleansed because it was recommended to them by either a close contact or by healthcare personnel. 69% (34/49) at least knew someone who consistently cleansed their genitals after sex. In the past 3 months, 58% (29/50) were at least most likely to use hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents to clean themselves after sex, and 26% (13/50) sometimes used an alcohol-based cleansing agent to clean themselves after sex. 34 participants used hand wipes, and 10 used alcohol-based hand sanitizer. All participants knew at least someone who consistently used hand sanitizer, hand wipes, or other alcohol-based cleansing agents.
 “We always tell men that: “wash your d**k” hahahaha… Really! We tell them in reality, sometimes jokingly, right? But usually when someone approaches me, they approach me like this and I say: “have you bathed? have you washed yourself well?” If he says yes to me and then I discover when he approaches me ready for the sexual act and I perceive “oh, just there, go take a bath, go wash.” If you want and if not bye, nothing happens.” Most interviewees found genital washing to be an essential aspect of both sexual well-being and one’s general bathing process. Although many learned these practices from family members and social circles, many participants questioned this behavior’s utility, efficacy, and proper techniques. A few shared their experiences using wet wipes, especially when bathing facilities were unavailable or during time constraints. For almost all, genital cleansing was an essential aspect of one’s own or their partner’s sex life. In the past 3 months, all participants reported douching at least once before sex. 84% (38/45) had regular access to adequate amenities/supplies (such as running water, enema solution, and enema bottle) for successful douches. 71% (29/41) douched within at least 30 minutes before sex. 39 participants douched to become more clean/hygienic, 30 participants douched to make sex more pleasurable, 23 participants douched to increase their peace of mind, and 16 participants douched due to recommendations from either a close contact or from an HCP. 8 participants douched to decrease their risk of contracting HIV/STI. 32 participants used a water-based douching solution, 10 used a water-based solution with chamomile, and 3 used a water-based solution with salt or vinegar. 96% (46/48) have never shared enema supplies with sexual partners or other associates. 86% (42/49) knew at least one person who consistently douches before sex. In the past 3 months, 59% (27/46) participants reported douching at least most of the time after sex, with 72% (28/39) douching within at least 30 minutes after sex. 83% (34/41) douched after their most recent sexual activity.
 “This is a very worrying issue, I do this type of anal washing myself, right? More hygienic when you have your sexual relations. The issue is that it harms your health, due to the issue of the PH that we have in that part, right? And well, genital washing is normal, it should be done daily, right? Er, there isn’t as much danger there as in anal washings, which harms you. I see it daily with trans girls, uh, we talk about that, but the issue is also about cleanliness, and many people call it “pumping”, it’s the term used in the community. And they demand: “I want you to pump yourself very well”, and many people demand that kind of thing from them and many times they agree to do those washings. We know that we are harming ourselves, I for my part know it, but sometimes because of the issue of looking good, for a cleanliness issue, we agree. And in trans girls, I have seen that [anal washing] is constant, every day every so often, they even don’t eat many times because they don’t [get dirty], because they have their entire stomachs clean, and they don’t get the other person dirty. That is very worrying, and to improve this, enemas are also used, but really many people due to the issue of access to the enema, it is a bit expensive to use. Mostly they do it just like that with bottles.” Douching was a considerable part of one’s sexual hygiene or that of their partner. There was a diverse range of manifestations and justifications for douching, primarily determined by the sexual position they assumed and the accessibility of proper amenities/supplies. Some recognized their complex relationship with douching and its potential harms. A few participants shared that they significantly decreased their nutritional intake to avoid the presence of fecal remnants during planned intercourse. Some questioned why there are no resources sharing this practice’s potential harms, benefits, and proper techniques.
 “They feel bad, with shame they feel dirty, and the client is upset. And they don’t want that. Once, a man got annoyed with me, I told him to go to hell, I told him: jerk, where the hell are you going? He looked at me [and said]: “is that right?” Yeah dude, what do you think? I pump myself, but it’s not my fault that something was left out there. Don’t come to me with that “wash yourself well, stupid”. And he didn’t call me anymore, and he sent me to hell. And I tell the girls: you don’t have to let yourself be dominated like that. In other words, they are very submissive, and at times I get annoyed and tell them: stop fooling around, don’t let this jerk manipulate you and dominate you. “It’s just that he gives me money, I don’t know what to do.” Turn it around [penetrate him too]. “No, mother” [they reply]. Do it -I tell them- and you’ll see that he’s not going to bother you anymore.” In the last 3 months, 65% (32/49) of participants had access to an adequate amount of lubricant within reach at least most of the time. If participants were to have lube on hand, 82% (41/50) are at least most likely to use lube before or during intercourse. 39 participants used water-based lubricants, 16 used oil-based lubricants or Vaseline, and 9 used saliva. 72% (34/47) at least knew one person who consistently uses lubricants before or during intercourse.
 “There is no facility for that, that is a limitation… a limitation that the state must remedy, we consider it important. Because condoms are good for prevention, that is true, but they are used in areas that are not lubricated because we are talking about sexual practices with trans women, right? And they are used in areas, in the rectum, an area that is not lubricated, that is in itself a little dry, it will be wet but not enough to be able to receive, to withstand penetration without harm. Lubricant saves you.” Many interview participants acknowledged the superiority of water-based lubrication to reduce pain and rectal damage. While most stated a preference for water-based lubricants, some reported using saliva and oil-based household products for sexual lubrication due to convenience and preferences from sexual partners. Some participants noted accessibility issues with water-based lubrication and adverse symptoms associated with saliva and oil-based lubrication. In the last 3 months, 39% (19/49) of participants sometimes urinated after sex, with 53% (26/49) urinating after sex at least most of the time. 91% (43/47) typically urinated within 15 minutes after intercourse. 43 participants urinated to relieve the natural urge, 12 urinated for peace of mind, 10 urinated to decrease their risk of HIV/STI, and 9 urinated due to easy accessibility of bathroom facilities. 74% (37/50) were at least most likely to have regular access to a toilet after sex. 59% (29/49) knew of at least one person who consistently urinated after sex.
 “… they informed me from some training that it was convenient to urinate afterwards because that can help eliminate some -er, let’s say- bacteria or agents that can cause diseases of the urethral canals, right? Oh, and we recommend it. Have I been specifically asked questions about it? I don’t think so. People are not very aware of this topic, and it is rather something that I have to bring up in conversation and tell them: “uh, well, remember that after having sex, as much as possible it would be good for you to urinate, right? no?’, And in that way it helps to eliminate germs, er and to the extent possible even that could occur. Er, so, that’s what I recommend, but it’s not like -according to what I remember right now- they have come to ask me: “hey should I urinate? Or how is this urination?” I don’t know if it’s so well spread or if people know it so much that they don’t ask anymore, right? It’s probably not that widespread.” Although most interview participants performed postcoital urination, some were unsure of this practice and questioned its utility and efficacy. A few participants noted the difference in one’s tendency to urinate after sex, determined if the partner is topping (performing insertive or penetrating sex), one’s hydration status, and if they previously voided. 20% (10/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum may increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 54% (27/50) were in agreement that using enemas to clean the rectum did not increase the risk of contracting HIV/STI. 86% (43/50) were in agreement that microscopic tears may increase the chance of contracting HIV, and 8% (4/50) did not know. 82% (41/50) were in agreement that using a lubricant before and during sex didn’t prevent oneself from contracting HIV, and 12% (6/50) did not know. 68% (34/50) were in agreement that water-based lubricant helps prevent condom breakage, and 14% (7/50) did not know. 78% (39/50) were in agreement that Vaseline, oil-based lubricant, body lotion, or cooking oils were not the correct methods of lubrication before or during sexual intercourse. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that showering or washing one’s genitals with soap and water after sex does not prevent a person from contracting HIV, and 16% (8/50) did not know. 80% (40/50) were in agreement that urinating after sex does not prevent oneself from getting HIV, and 18% (9/50) did not know. 76% (38/50) felt it would be at least somewhat easy to stay informed about HIV prevention methods.
 “ do feel that the government should have more authority in working to inform their students through the [school] curriculum, like teachers should speak about this and there should be less power of the family groups to inform because usually the family groups tend to communicate or misinform through a political agenda due to a lack of knowledge of their own, so I prefer that the person who informs them about these important things to people at this age that they need is the government or someone who has studied for 5 years for that” Most interview participants possessed an accurate understanding of basic HIV/STI science, specifically regarding transmission routes, condoms, water-based lubrication, and genital cleansing. However, some participants shared misguided information concerning douching and PrEP The majority (76%, 38/50) had access to a functioning cell phone most of the time, with 92% (45/49) having access to reliable cellular internet at least most of the time. 92% (46/50) used social media at least most of the time during the day. 60% (30/50) of participants sometimes used social media for health-related purposes, with 30% (15/50) of participants using social media for health-related purposes at least most of the time. 49 participants used WhatsApp, 48 used Facebook, 37 used Instagram, 36 used TikTok, and 34 used YouTube. 38 participants used social media for health-related purposes to increase knowledge about diseases, 38 participants to receive updates on advances in healthcare, and 27 participants to exchange tips and ideas on health topics. Participants’ preferences for learning modalities included 31 participants selecting animated videos, 31 selecting virtual educational materials on social media, 28 selecting printed educational materials, 27 selecting a website, and 21 selecting reminders from healthcare personnel.
 Most interview participants recognized the increasing convenience and usability of mobile and social media technologies. However, some acknowledged barriers to mobile technologies, including sharing devices, limitations with rural settings, and acceptability concerns with older, conservative individuals. Some participants shared optimistic perspectives regarding the integration of a hygiene-based intervention in clinical and social settings. Some also noted flyers, brochures, and in-person workshops as potential modalities to increase the awareness of a hygiene-based message. 16% (8/50) of participants were at least in agreement that it frustrates them to think that they will have to use lube before or during sex, wash with soap and water, and urinate after sex. 20% (10/50) were at least in agreement that they would be worried about using these practices because it would harm their health. 86% (43/50) were at least in disagreement with the statement that they would be worried if their healthcare provider found out if they were using a lubricant before/during sex, urinating after sex, and washing their genitals. 84% (42/50) were at least in agreement with the statement that their sexual partners and family would support them if they used these hygiene-based practices, and 76% (38/50) believed their healthcare provider would support them as well. 82% (41/50) of participants were at least in agreement that people in their community would be interested in learning more about hygiene-based practices. 74% (37/50) were at least in agreement that people in their community would consider using lube before or during sex, washing with soap and water, and urinating after sex.
 Most interviewees expressed an interest in learning more about hygiene-based practices. However, many reported barriers to their ability to be well-informed about condom-based and non-condom-based methods for HIV/STI prevention. Some identified the conservative government of Peru, traditional cultural norms, inaccurate HIV/STI resources, lack of LGBTQ+ representation, and substandard values of sensitivity from healthcare providers as the most notable obstacles faced by TW and GBMSM to optimizing one’s sexual and general health.
 “t has to be something constant and always renewable, that is not always the same, that is, not only to make the [trans] girls come for the simple fact that I give them condoms, or in a worship I give them the money, no, but make them come for other things, right? It can also be a space for articulation or union between the girls themselves who can come together and share–what do I know–an afternoon of movies, a talk or a conversation, like we call it a “tea for aunts;” a space where the community can come and -er- at any time they want, not only to receive condoms, lubricants, right? It stays as a community, but it is something that over time, as time goes by, begins to give different -um- prevention in different ways, but for the same community, right?” This study aimed to bring awareness to the commonality of hygiene-based practices and provide a preliminary assessment of the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of lubrication, genital cleansing, postcoital urination, and douching. A diverse range of viewpoints and experiences highlighted real-world trends and needs of local TW and GBMSM. Study data indicated the potential acceptability and feasibility of water-based lubrication and postcoital urination and washing, despite some participants questioning and a few sharing misguided information about the safety and efficacy of these practices. All survey and most interview participants voiced usability with douching, despite a majority of survey participants showcasing misinformation about douching’s potential harms. In addition, an impressive number of participants reported sexual uses of alcohol-based cleansers (such as hand wipes and hand sanitizer), oil-based household products and saliva-based lubrication, and douching with chamomile, salt, and vinegar. Given the prevalence of douching and other hygiene-based practices within our sample, we question whether past epidemiological research has underrepresented the commonality of receptive and hygiene-based practices among Peruvian TW and GBMSM or whether these findings are more reflective of sampling bias. Regardless, most participants recognized that local TW and GBMSM have been longing for more accessible and accurate information about douching, lubrication, postcoital urination and washing, and its associated risks, benefits, and safest techniques. A fair number of testimonials emerged during the interviews highlighting sociopolitical hardships to one’s autonomy in the context of HIV/STI risk. As this study was being conducted, most TW and GBMSM did not have the opportunity to start PrEP due to widespread accessibility issues. Even among the minority who were fortunate to have access to effective methods, a few participants were stigmatized during their adherence to PrEP and condoms, expressing that they were perceived as being “unhealthy” or “unholy” by others for simply prioritizing their sexual health. Interestingly, if given the hypothetical opportunity to take PrEP in the future, most wouldn’t anticipate any changes to their current behavioral practices. Nevertheless, some did predict an increased number of sexual partners and decreased use of condoms with hypothetical PrEP use. Furthermore, some bottoms (or partners performing receiving or receptive sex) shared accounts of victimization and manipulation for the sexual, typically risky, desires of dominant, masculine tops. Although there was a diverse spectrum of femininity and masculinity among our sample, these pains were disproportionately against submissive, feminine bottoms. Some have testimonies of being forced to douche, not using condoms or water-based lubricants, abusing poppers (an inhalant used to enhance sex and relax the anal muscles), and hiding HIV/STI pharmaceutical treatment. It’s reassuring that community leaders recognize this power imbalance and actively empower submissive TW and GBMSM; however, much more discussion and action are needed to dissipate this inequality. Regarding preferred learning modalities, multi-media deliverables are a promising area for future research and public health initiatives. Our results are in line with previous findings that show Internet-based technologies as valuable vehicles for optimizing one’s sexual health–validating the importance of low-intensity modalities. Most participants shared positive attitudes towards accurate, health-related content seen on social media. Many also recognized the utility of printed materials, in-person workshops, and other outreach events to increase awareness of a hygiene-based message. Although most participants liked the direction of the project, participants’ perspectives focused on suggestions to improve our message and implementation in the future. Recognizing the conservative nature of Peruvian society, some participants pinpointed outdated ideologies and prejudices as the main driving force for the many vulnerabilities TW and GBMSM face for equitable HIV/STI care and societal attention. Understandably, some skepticism may be present regarding the acceptability of a hygiene-based message and other new HIV/STI resources due to its novelty and the traditional nature of Peru’s culture. We are grateful that our sample shared valuable strategies to overcome these barriers and ensure a collective mission in the fight against HIV/STI. General recommendations focused on ensuring satisfactory LGBTQ + representation and advisement on all future directions of L Overall, interest in these hygiene-based practices was high, and many were curious about the project’s future. These preliminary results add to an under-valued body of literature showcasing the increasing justification of a hygiene-based message for HIV/STI prevention. To our awareness, this is the first study that explored the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of hygiene-based practices and preferred learning modalities prioritizing TW. Given the exploratory nature of our study, we did not intend to demonstrate statistical significance from our findings. Rather, we sought to identify barriers and facilitators to inform a larger acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy study. Additional work is needed to address the identified barriers and further explore the potential of a hygiene-based message in the prevention of HIV/STI. Unfortunately, our data was vulnerable to considerable bias, and we encountered several limitations in this study. Despite our best efforts, sampling bias likely occurred, decreasing the external validity of our assumptions used to derive real-world trends. Most notably, these included advertising, self-selection, and healthy-user bias. Methodological and statistical limitations were also present, including our small sample size, lack of similar research studies to reference from, the use of self-reported data, cross-cultural and translational drawbacks, and the lack of advanced quantitative analysis techniques. In addition, the investigator team was unable to retrieve particular survey data, likely due to restricted access from a free  There were notable strengths of the study. The mentorship team actively prioritized the core values of the project’s mission and a holistic refinement process using the best available, evidence-based resources and a participatory design process among the research team. Our reliance on diverse organizations and public health centers within different districts of Peru significantly enhanced the depth and variety of perspectives from our sample. The team and our sample were fortunate to have JCA as a vital contributor to the project’s highest standards of transparency, sensitivity, and respect for all involved. All participants received evidence-based HIV/AIDS educational materials, referrals to available HIV-related services, and resources on local community organizations. All interview participants were given condoms and personal water-based lubricants, and provided a safe, private space to discuss sensitive topics of sexual health that are not common in “normal” social settings in Peru. During a post-research event, we additionally shared the study results with past participants, local TW-GBMSM organizations, and community partners. All participants were also provided a PDF copy of all published articles. Lastly, the results from this study may offer indirect benefits to researchers, educators, and key community members with an additional understanding of a variety of common behaviors and attitudes that may impact sexual health and practical approaches to sharing health-related information that may prove critical for the development of important sexual health interventions. This study represents a pivotal step in investigating the role of hygiene-based practices and multi-media deliverables in promoting evidence-based HIV/STI prevention education. Overall, participants found water-based lubrication, and postcoital urination and washing to be potentially acceptable and feasible to adhere to consistently. Most participants also shared significant usability with douching. In addition, mobile messaging modalities for health-related purposes and in-person events were favorably liked among participants.","['Hygiene', 'lubrication', 'cleansing', 'urination', 'douching', 'learning', 'intervention']",2024-9-20,Research Square,Gonorrhea
11451046,The Tulumbe! Partnership: a case study in developing a community-led research agenda to address HIV among African immigrants in the United States,"Grassroots, community organizations are trusted resources within communities, which puts them in an ideal position to effectively engage individuals impacted by health inequities in defining meaningful research priorities. A community-centered approach to HIV research is critical for African immigrants living in the United States, who experience stigma and other socio-structural barriers to HIV prevention, care, and research engagement. Supporting community organizations with financial resources and capacity building activities to lead the development of research agendas ensures better alignment with community interests and fosters sustainability. We developed a community-initiated and -led research engagement project—Tulumbe!, which prioritized community leadership in all project activities. Community forums, health care provider and community questionnaires, interviews, and report-back sessions were held to examine the research interests and health concerns voiced by African immigrants. The iterative, community-led engagement process of more than 200 African immigrants, health providers, and researchers resulted in a community-defined research agenda with six areas of focus: family communication; self-efficacy for African immigrant women; deconstructing masculinity for African immigrant men; sexual health education for African immigrant youth; HIV stigma; and health literacy. Time, resources, and flexibility are needed to develop a viable community-led research partnership. Investing in community leadership not only produced a patient-centered research agenda but also led to community ownership of the process and results; thus, all partners were committed to sustaining the work.","Communities have been at the forefront of organizing and implementing strategies to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis since it emerged in the 1980s ( An asserted shift toward more inclusive and community-centered research methodologies within the HIV response has been essential to advancements in the field of HIV research ( The importance of community engagement is further underscored by the ‘Ending the HIV Epidemic’ (EHE) strategy for the United States, which emphasizes the importance of community-driven solutions to leverage scientific advances in HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outbreak response. A key aspect of this strategy is mandating each jurisdiction under EHE to allocate a minimum of 25% of their EHE funds to programs and initiatives that promote community engagement. These initiatives are to be led by community-based organizations, reinforcing the central role of communities in driving the HIV response ( There are various participatory methods for CBPR/CER ( However, while community engagement practices like advisory boards have shown significant improvements in transparency and inclusion, there are still existing barriers and limitations that not only hinder effectiveness ( One CBPR/CER strategy that warrants attention is directly funding community-based organizations (CBOs) to lead community engagement efforts throughout the research process, starting from the generation of ideas for research projects or studies. CBOs’ familiarity with and proximity to communities position them to not only engage individuals impacted by HIV inequities in shaping meaningful research but also to enhance research literacy and foster community ownership of the work. However, despite their critical role, CBOs face challenges in securing funding and establishing the infrastructure required by funders ( Our key argument emphasizes that CBOs are well-positioned and capable of leading efforts to define research agendas. The effective engagement strategies implemented by CBOs cater to the cultural and linguistic norms of communities. A community-led approach enhances the relevance and impact of research by aligning with the lived experiences and needs of communities. This article documents our process and outcomes, making a significant contribution to the literature on effective community engagement strategies for racialized and minoritized populations. Additionally, it highlights the need for a pivotal shift in the research enterprise. Shifting to a more equitable approach is especially critical in the context of HIV research among marginalized populations. African immigrants are one of the fastest-growing immigrant communities in the United States and accounted for the fastest growth in the US Black immigrant population ( One of the strengths of the African immigrant community in the United States is the trusted sources that have the cultural knowledge, skills, and expertise to break down barriers. African immigrants tend to form close-knit, ethnic enclaves consisting of faith and civic organizations founded by earlier immigrants. Many of these organizations serve as a place to maintain cultural ties, as well as provide support and other services. These truly grassroots entities are often the only agents that African immigrants trust and utilize regularly, putting them in a unique position to lead research engagement. The term ‘stakeholders’ carries a historical and harmful representation of colonization and the stealing of land endured by Indigenous peoples. Hence, we use different terms to describe organizations or individuals with an interest or concern in addressing HIV among African immigrants. Terms such as ‘interested parties,’ ‘partners,’ or ‘collaborators’ depict the nature of our engagements without causing discomfort or perpetuating historical injustices. ‘Stakeholder’ is only used when presented as part of a title for a document or formal statement. The Africans for Improved Access (AFIA) program at the Multicultural AIDS Coalition (MAC) has a strong history of successfully providing HIV/STD outreach, education, testing, and navigation services to African immigrants in Massachusetts ( The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded AFIA through its Pipeline to Proposal (P2P) Awards to establish and build capacity for a patient-centered research partnership addressing HIV among African immigrants. PCORI was formed in 2010 to support patients and their caregivers in making informed decisions about clinical care. The institute funds multi-year patient-centered engagement and comparative effectiveness research (CER) projects. Patient-centered means prioritizing the involvement of patients in the design, implementation, analysis, and dissemination phases. Patients are defined as individuals, “… who are representative of the population of interest in a study, as well as their family members, caregivers, and the organizations that represent them ( As part of its patient engagement portfolio, PCORI launched the Pipeline to Proposal (P2P) Awards, which aimed to engage individuals and groups not typically involved in clinical research. The program was a three-tier funding mechanism designed to build the capacity of patient-centered partnerships to develop comparative effectiveness research questions that could be translated into research proposals for PCORI funding or other health research funders. Tier I focused on building partnerships and capacity for patient-centered research, Tier II supported partnerships in developing research questions, and Tier III provided funding to develop a full research proposal ready for submission to PCORI or other funding sources. In addition to small funding, grantees were provided training and technical assistance through webinars, one-on-one consultations, and tools/templates ( AFIA was funded for Tier I (2016) and Tier II (2017). In 2018, funding for Tier II P2P grantees to progress through the pipeline to Tier III was discontinued. Throughout the funding cycle, the Tulumbe! Partnership (hereinafter referred to as Tulumbe!) met biweekly to plan and implement project activities. “Tulumbe!” is a Luganda (language spoken in Uganda) word that means, “to engage.”  Tulumbe! process and outcomes.

The overall purposes of the Pipeline to Proposal award were to develop a multi-sector research partnership, build capacity for patient-centered outcomes research, and inform a subsequent research application. In addition, the P2P award specifically prohibited the use of funds for research purposes. The information presented in this article is a retrospective evaluation of the project. During Tier I, Tulumbe! developed the partnership structure and engagement strategies for African immigrants and key organizations. We held two community forums to hear from African community members, leaders, and civic and faith organizations about barriers and facilitators to utilizing HIV services. Forums were divided into two parts—video with a large group discussion and small discussion groups by gender. Following the introduction, we showed a 25-min, locally developed video, In Our House: An African Story, which depicts an African immigrant family’s journey in dealing with HIV and HIV-related stigma in the United States. Participants were encouraged to discuss the video and ask questions. After lunch, participants were divided into gender-specific small discussion groups. Each group had two facilitators who prompted a discussion on ‘what works’ and ‘what does not work’ in accessing and utilizing HIV primary and secondary services. The facilitators took notes during the discussions. Both community forums lasted 3 h and ended with thanking the community members for their time and celebrating with an African dance and drumming performance. Participants received a $50 gift card for attending the community forums and providing valuable input. Testing for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis C was provided on-site by the AFIA program. During Tier I we also administered a 17-item questionnaire to healthcare providers on the critical issues and successes experienced when providing HIV screening, linkage to care, and treatment services to African immigrants. Engagement activities for Tier II started with convening a community report-back forum (approximately 4 h) where community members, providers, and researchers prioritized 5 health topics defined in Tier I and began developing the content for research questions. At the forum, we provided a brief history of Tulumbe! and reported back on Tier I accomplishments. We also shared the HIV epidemiology data on the epidemic among African immigrant communities. All this information provided context for attendees to fully engage with a prioritization exercise. We continued to gain feedback on the health topics and ideas for research questions by presenting at various provider meetings. In addition, we distributed a questionnaire to have African immigrant community members prioritize CER topic areas and questions. Community members who completed the questionnaire received a $10 gift card as a token of appreciation for their time and valuable input. The theoretical perspective that guided the project, including the data analysis, was grounded in a participatory approach. Our approach was informed by CBPR principles, which emphasizes active collaboration between community members, researchers, and other interested parties. Academic partners acknowledge power differentials and work to reduce these differentials by building trust, mutual respect, and community leadership. Qualitative data were documented by notes taken during discussions and staff written reports. Questionnaire and evaluation data were collected in hard copy, assigned a unique identification number, and analyzed using Statistical Analysis System version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics were computed for each variable. All data were reviewed with Tulumbe! partners during in-person biweekly meetings. Partners engaged in an iterative, participatory data analysis process to identify themes and make meaning of the data (further described in Results section). Tulumbe! consisted of African immigrants living with HIV and representatives from key organizations in Massachusetts’ HIV services landscape, including clinical researchers, state public health officials, clinical social workers, direct care providers, advocates, and African immigrant community and faith leaders. Majority of the leadership team members were first- or second-generation African immigrants, representing several African countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. In addition, most leadership team members had been involved in HIV care for at least 5 years, with several having over 10 years of experience. Community members and direct care providers on the leadership team were actively involved in their local communities, holding positions in African civic organizations, and participating in events. These deep community connections and extensive knowledge about providing HIV services to African immigrants supported effective communication about the project and the development of clear engagement strategies. Early during Tier I, partners named the partnership “Tulumbe!” to reflect our vision. Partners developed a governance document and created a partnership structure that centered around a continuous engagement process for African immigrants, providers, researchers, and relevant organizations. The document created agreement around the partnership’s mission, values, guiding principles, structure, responsibilities, and decision-making process, as seen in  Tulumbe! governance document. As shown by  Tulumbe! partnership organizational structure. Most members of the Core Circle served voluntarily; however, African immigrant community members received a stipend for attending meetings which included meals. Childcare, parking, and travel were reimbursed separately. Community Forums: Two community forums were held—one in Lowell, MA at a local African church and the other in Boston, MA at the AFIA office. African immigrants were recruited through flyers distributed via the social networks of leadership team members and through direct outreach to African-led organizations and community leaders by AFIA staff. Approximately 50 community members, including both men and women aged 18 years and older, were in attendance. Diverse African countries were represented including, Eritrea, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. For the small group discussions, participants were divided into gender-specific groups—men and women. This division fostered a comfortable and open environment, enabling participants to freely discuss sensitive topics, including HIV stigma and gender-specific experiences with HIV. Similar topics were discussed in gender-specific groups across both community forums. HIV stigma emerged as a central concern. Participants highlighted the cultural factors that contribute to HIV stigma, emphasizing the consequences of being isolated if someone discloses their HIV status and the secrecy and the taboo around discussing sex. One participant mentioned that “sex can be viewed as sacred and sinful simultaneously.” Specifically, in the women’s small discussion group, issues with gender dynamics were noted. These dynamics often position men as superior to women, with women being unjustly blamed for HIV transmission and related issues. Both men and women accept and often normalize this notion. Women face difficulties in understanding their bodies, expressing themselves, and challenging traditional beliefs. Participants noted that these challenges are further exacerbated when immigrating to more open societies, such as the United States. Existing prevention strategies were perceived to be ineffective for African immigrants. Participants emphasized the need for community outreach and comprehensive sex education. More strategies should invest in partnerships with the community to ensure more effective outreach efforts. Consistent and widespread culturally sensitive education about HIV/AIDS and other infections within the community was thought to be essential. The role of African men and women in discussing sex with children was explored, revealing a tendency for communication about sex to be led by mothers or other women, with men often absent from these discussions. Women participants expressed a desire for assistance in having open and sex-positive communication with male and female children while also integrating their cultural and religious values. One participant exclaimed, “We do not know how to do it [because] no one did it for us [when we were growing up].” Other strategies discussed included having representatives within the African immigrant community who can openly share their experiences with HIV or related diseases and establishing more social organizations specific to the African immigrant community to address HIV-related issues. Facilitators observed that there was also a lack of basic knowledge on HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment. Provider Questionnaire: Fifty-three providers completed the questionnaire. In delivering HIV prevention and care services to African immigrants, most providers identified stigma and a lack of cultural appropriateness in services and HIV prevention messaging as significant barriers. Effective strategies used by providers included: ensuring confidentiality, offering open access to publicly funded services and medications, training and employing African immigrants in various roles like Community Health Workers (CHWs) and case managers, conducting outreach in local African immigrant-owned businesses, facilitating community-based testing initiatives, integrating services for a seamless approach (e.g., test and treat strategy), and prioritizing individualized, one-on-one client consultations while addressing broader concerns before focusing on HIV-related aspects. Ineffective interventions for HIV in African immigrant communities involved using existing evidence-based approaches designed for other groups, like African Americans or Caribbean immigrants. Also, aggressive HIV-focused messaging and peer support groups have not proven successful. Similarly, assuming one approach fits all and using English-only campaigns have shown limited effectiveness. The Tulumbe! Core Circle held two in-person partnership meetings to review data collected from the provider questionnaire and the two community forums, with the aim of developing Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) topics. Partners also reflected on their experiences as direct care service providers and researchers. It was an iterative process. First, key themes were identified and posted on a board. Then members considered the themes that occurred more frequently and those that were raised by both the community and the providers. Common themes were developed into research topics. Some issues were specific to sub-groups in the African immigrant community—women, men, youth, and families. However, others were cross-cutting (e.g., stigma and communication). See  Five HIV-related research topics developed through a community-led process for addressing HIV among African immigrants. Engagement of Wider Community and Interested Parties: Tulumbe! presented at the Massachusetts Integrated Prevention and Planning Council (MIPPC), a group of consumers, HIV providers, and staff from the Office of HIV/AIDS that provide guidance on HIV prevention and care programs and policy initiatives. The discussion with MIPPC members yielded another topic: health literacy. This refers to the extent to which a person has “the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others ( Community Report Back Forum: Thirty-three African immigrants attended the forum. Participants engaged in an interactive process to prioritize research topics and brainstorm research questions. Facilitators guided a discussion with participants to understand the research topic. Using dot voting, all participants prioritized three (3) research topics—(1) reducing HIV stigma in the community, (2) increasing safer sex and testing among African immigrant youth, and (3) improving family communication around sexual health. In small groups, participants were able to further explore the prioritized topics using information sheets, which included (a) narratives and quotes that reflect community perspectives about the research topic (b) state epidemiological data, and (c) findings from the project. Each group received one topic. This structured process facilitated meaningful and informed discussions to identify data gaps and areas requiring research. Community Questionnaire: In preparation for developing the questionnaire, C.B. facilitated training on CER. During this training partners used the data from the community report-back forum to develop questions that apply to CER and other study designs, such as qualitative exploratory studies. The community questionnaire aimed to gather feedback on prioritized research topics and questions selected during the community report-back forum with the added ‘health literacy’ research topic. Respondents were tasked with ranking the most vital question within each research topic on a scale of 1 (least important) to 5 (most important). Approximately 40 community members completed the questionnaire during a local African event. All were adults representing 16 African countries, primarily Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, and Kenya.  Prioritized research topics and questions. Partners disseminated the community-defined research priorities to community and academic networks at the end of Tier I and Tier II. Presentations were made at several national and local health and HIV conferences whereas Tulumbe! community members were stipend to attend. Partners also went to different African events, such as the African Festival Lowell, Moroccan Cultural Day, Kenyan Youth Cookout, and African Health Cup to share the research priorities with the community. For dissemination activities, partners created an infographic with the final six health topics. (See  Despite the significance of community organizations in addressing the critical HIV needs of minoritized and racialized communities, often these organizations are not adequately supported to lead research engagement efforts. With dedicated funding and capacity building, Tulumbe! successfully engaged over 150 African immigrants and more than 50 healthcare providers and researchers through in-person events and questionnaires. Efforts yielded six HIV-related research priorities that were responsive to community needs and critical to addressing HIV among African immigrants in the United States. Our process of developing a research agenda engaged diverse individuals and organizations and was specifically led by African immigrants. The topics and questions were developed for a research agenda but were also applicable to what needs to be accomplished in other areas, such as advocacy, policy, and service delivery. The creation of a governance document played a pivotal role in unifying our partnership around shared values, guiding principles, and expectations. We demonstrated that being open, appreciating, and understanding that each person at the table has different experiences to offer enriches the collective work of the partnership. This not only fostered collective buy-in and ownership within the partnership but also provided a clear roadmap for our work during both Tier I and Tier II phases. In addition, all partners were committed, fully engaged, and retained throughout the funding cycle. This was evident by meeting attendance, partners taking on specific tasks (i.e., facilitating meetings, leading completion of deliverables), and partners participating in project activities (i.e., facilitating the community forum, disseminating the provider questionnaire). Because of our partnership’s comradery, we were able to create safe spaces for the community to share and have difficult, realistic, and sometimes personal, conversations about HIV/AIDS. The flexibility in the use of funding further allowed us to actively involve the community in our partnership and offer support for their engagement in a way that fostered leadership. As a community-led group, Tulumbe! served as the initial engagement of members representing the patient population—African immigrants, including their family members, caregivers, community leaders, and the organizations that represent them—and interested parties. Through intentional engagement at various project stages, community members gained confidence in understanding and actively participating in research, thereby enhancing their research literacy. Tulumbe! had several challenges when planning and implementing the project. Time Commitment: The project required a significant time commitment from all members. Active engagement included members attending regular meetings, contributing to planning tasks outside of meetings, and leading project activities. Balancing these commitments with other work, school, and family responsibilities was challenging for some members. In addition, the partnership had to manage supporting members who lived far from the central site location, Boston. To minimize these challenges the Program Coordinator maintained ongoing ‘check-ins’ with members, and when possible, Tulumbe! held meetings online. In addition, community members were compensated for travel to project activities and leadership meetings. Managing Membership: Several members could no longer continue after Tier I. In addition, the governance document was revised in Tier II to include specific language allowing the removal of inactive members. Thus, Tulumbe! had to add members to ensure representation of the community (e.g., youth) and expertise needed (e.g., mental health). This presented an additional layer of complexity because new members joining the partnership needed time to familiarize themselves with the project’s goals, processes, and the unique dynamics of the collaboration. It was important to balance the need for building comradery and effectively integrating the perspectives of these new members while maintaining momentum in implementing the project. Funding: The unexpected cancelation of Tier III funding had a significant impact on the project, disrupting planned activities and jeopardizing the partnership’s continuity. It was communicated at the last stages of Tier II, so partners had to quickly discuss opportunities to support sustainability. Many funders cater to more traditional research approaches, which makes it difficult to secure the necessary resources for community-driven initiatives that require the time-consuming work of developing the partnership and meaningfully engaging the community. Securing funding, especially for capacity building and community engagement, required Tulumbe! to be creative and strategically identify aspects of the project that were fundable. Partnership Momentum: Maintaining momentum and enthusiasm among partnership members while waiting for grant funding decisions was difficult. Tulumbe! was able to use this time to disseminate the outcomes of the project. The development of six community-defined research priorities led to Tulumbe! submitting grants to enhance the sustainability of the community partnership, further explore HIV-related issues among African immigrants, and develop community-driven behavior change and structural interventions. Two proposals were funded (a) a photovoice project developing a digital campaign to address HIV-related stigma funded by Getting to Zero MA ( Essential to the HIV response has been that those closest to the problem are often closest to the solution. Providing community-based organizations with the capacity and resources to lead research engagement endeavors can enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of HIV research. Prioritizing opportunities for African immigrants to lead at all levels of the project—from leadership and decision-making to administering and participating in the engagement activities—created research directions that accurately represent the community’s unique perspectives and lived experiences. In addition, the research priorities identified provided other key entities such as hospitals, health departments, and policymakers with the most current information on the evolving needs of African immigrant communities and the fundamental factors contributing to HIV inequities. It is imperative that funding allocated for community-led efforts remains flexible to accommodate the time required for establishing a viable research partnership founded on shared values, capacity building, and commitment. Recent initiatives like the National Institutes of Health’s Community Partnerships to Advance Science for Society (ComPASS) Program have started to recognize and support this need ( This paper has outlined the processes utilized during two tiers of PCORI P2P funding to actively engage the African immigrant community in identifying research topics of greatest interest to them. The engagement strategies described are not only replicable but also adaptable, offering a blueprint for other contexts where community leadership in defining a research agenda is vital. By documenting and sharing these experiences, we aim to inspire a paradigm shift toward more community-centric research that centers community voices and leadership in shaping health research priorities.","['community-engaged research', 'HIV/AIDS', 'patient-centered', 'African immigrants', 'community engagement', 'refugees', 'migrant health']",2024-9-20,Frontiers in Public Health,Gonorrhea
11450779,Medicinal plants diversity among the oromo community in heban-arsi district of Ethiopia used to manage human and livestock ailments,"Medicinal plants are commonly employed mainly due their accessibility, affordability and potency. However, medicinal plants and the associated knowledge are disappearing at an alarming rate due to natural and anthropogenic causes and thus a need for their proper documentation conservation. This study was performed to document traditional knowledge related to use of medicinal plants in Heban-Arsi district, West-Arsi Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Interviews were conducted with 185 informants to identify medicinal plants used in traditional therapies in the study area. Informant consensus factor (ICF), rank order priority (ROP) values were computed, and preference ranking exercises were performed to assess the relative importance of medicinal plants. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to measure and compare medicinal plants knowledge between social groups. A total of 120 medicinal plants were identified for being used to treat different human and animal illnesses in the study area. Most of the medicinal plants (76.4%) were uncultivated ones obtained from different habitats. Leaf was the most frequently used plant part constituting 62.6% of preparations. Oral was the most commonly used route of remedy administration (46%) in treating diseases. Gastrointestinal ailments category had the highest ICF value (0.83). In the study area, the highest rank order priority (ROP) values were recorded for  The study area was found to be rich in medicinal plants that are useful in treating a wide range of human and animal illnesses. In future pharmacological and phytochemical investigations, priority needs to be given to medicinal plants of the highest ROP values and those that were reported against ailment categories scoring the highest ICF values.","Historically, humans have relied on nature to provide for their basic needs, including the use of plants as medicine to treat a variety of illnesses ( Traditional medicine has been practiced in Ethiopia since antiquity and hence it has permeated all social groups, and continues to be important to both human and animal health ( Like other developing countries, Ethiopian plant resources, including medicinal plants ( The study was conducted in Heban-Arsi district, West-Arsi Zone of Oromia Regional State, southeastern Ethiopia ( Map of Heban-Arsi district showing sampled kebeles. A reconnaissance survey was conducted in Heban-Arsi district in September 2022 with the purpose of selecting study kebeles and informants. Accordingly, four kebeles distributed across two agro-ecological zones of the district, and known for rich plant-based traditional medical practice were purposively identified for the study with the help of elders and local authorities. Argada Shaldo and Sanbaro Rogicha kebeles were from midland agro-climatic zone and Buku Waldaa and Dawe kebeles were from lowland agro climatic zone. From each kebeles, two villages were selected for sampling ( Study kebeles and sampled villages in the study district.

Prior to the initiation of interviews, every informant who took part in this investigation was provided with an explanation regarding the objectives of the study and assured of the utmost responsible and judicious handling of the information. The main methodologies employed for the collection of ethnobotanical data encompassed semi-structured interviews and field visits ( Ethnobotanical data were compiled in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and analyzed using SPSS version 20. The most useful information collected about medicinal plants was summarized using descriptive statistical methods, such as frequency and percentage. Preference ranking exercises were conducted on selected medicinal plants based on  The study proposal was reviewed and approved by the Addis Ababa University, Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology Institutional Research Ethics Review Committee (ALIPB-IRERC). Permissions were obtained from West-Arsi zone, and study district and Kebeles administrative offices to carry out the fieldwork. Verbal consent was obtained before interviewing each informant and traditional healer. Out of the total 185 informants involved in this study, 78.4% (n = 145) were males and 21.6% (n = 40) were females. The age of the informants in the study ranged from 20 to 89. Most of the informants were aged 41–60 years (45.4%; 84), followed by those aged 61–89 years (35.1%; 65) and aged 20–30 years (19.5%; 36). Regarding educational status of the informants, the majority (60.5%; 112) were illiterate and the remaining (39.5%; 73) were literate. The study found that 120 traditional medicinal plants taxa, distributed across 98 genera and 55 families, were used by the community in Heban-Arsi district ( Growth forms of traditional medicinal plants. The majority of medicinal plants (76.4%) used in the study district were reported to be uncultivated that were harvested from forests, rivers banks, grasslands, farm fields, farm edges, hills sides, roadsides, life fences and school compounds. Some were cultivated in home gardens (15%), and few others were harvested from both the wild and homestead gardens (8.6%). Leaf was the most commonly used plant part accounting for 62.6% of the remedy preparations, followed by bark (22.14%) ( Proportions of medicinal plant parts used in remedy preparation.

Result revealed that oral application was the most common route of remedy administration (80.1%) followed by external/dermal (32.1%) and nasal (4.6%) application. Few remedies were reported to be administered by insertion into deep wound (0.8%) and ocular (0.8%) ( Routes of remedy administration. The majority of traditional healers (81%) in the study area understood the effects of overdose use of the medicinal plants on the health of patients. They determined the dosages based on patient’s sex, age, presence and absence of pregnancy, body condition, nature of the ailment treated and the route of administration. Water glass, teacup, coffee cup, teaspoon, bottle cap, handful, and between two tips of fingers were used to determine dosages. Traditional healers advised their patients to drink fresh milk, coffee, yoghurt, roasted barley juice, butter and honey as antidotes during adverse effects. For example, leaves of  In the district, 54 human and 25 livestock ailments were recorded during interviews. The highest cited human ailments in the district were gastrointestinal complaints (157; 84.9%), skin disorders (98; 52.9%), infectious and parasitic diseases (liver disorders and internal parasite) (82; 44.3%), and malaria (71; 38.3%), while gastrointestinal disorders (bloat, stomachache and diarrhea) (130; 70.2%) and bacterial infections (anthrax and pasterollosis) (27; 14.6%) were the highest cited diseases of livestock. Result of preference ranking exercise conducted on medicinal plants that were used against diarrhea, the most commonly cited ailment in the study area, showed that Syzygium guineense (willd.)

Acquisition of traditional medicinal knowledge happens in multiple ways. Most of (167, 90.3%) informants said they acquired traditional healing knowledge through their family routes orally. The remaining (18, 9.7%) informants confirmed acquiring their healing knowledge from different sources through observation, friends and following the activities of traditional healers. A significant difference ( Comparison of medicinal plants knowledge between different social groups in the study area (n = 185). shows significant difference between groups with  The present study revealed a number of threats against medicinal plants in the study district. The most frequently cited threat was the expansion of agriculture into forest area and grasslands, which was reported by 55% of the respondents, followed by production of timber, unsustainable fuelwood collection and charcoal making, which accounted for 35% of the informants. Frequent drought was also reported by 10% of the informants as factor responsible for degradation and extinction of medicinal plants. Factors responsible for the depletion of traditional medical knowledge related to use of medicinal plants in the area include lack of interest by the younger generation to learn and practice it (14%), cultural changes and modernization (20%), the oral culture of medicinal plant knowledge transmission (14%), the secrecy surrounding the traditional medicine (25%), and the migration of youth from rural areas to cities in search of employment opportunities (27%). The fact that high diversity of medicinal plant are used in the study area indicates the high dependence of people on medicinal plants in the day-to-day management of a wide range of human and livestock diseases and this might be related to easy accessibility, cultural acceptability and affordability of medicinal plants, and the associated services. In the study area, Fabaceae contributed higher number of medicinal plants as compared to other families. Other studies conducted elsewhere in Ethiopia also reported the high contribution of Fabaceae to local medicinal flora ( According to the results of the current study, oral administration of medicinal plants was the primary mode of administration. Traditional healers advised their patients to take the necessary precautions when administering medicinal plants, by oral route since there is possibility that the patient will experience short- and long-term health complications. When using herbal remedies externally through the skin as opposed to internally through the mouth, there was comparatively less chance of poisoning from improper use ( In the study district, leaf was the most commonly used plant part in the preparation of traditional remedies. Other ethnobotanical studies conducted in other parts of Ethiopia ( Crushing was the most commonly used method in the preparation of remedies in the study area, which is consistent with earlier reports of studies carried out elsewhere in the country ( Inconsistency in dosage prescriptions of plant remedies used against same or similar ailments in the study area was frequently noted, which could be considered as one of the predicaments of traditional medicine. A study conducted elsewhere in the country also reported similar finding ( Among the human diseases categories reported, the high ICF value was scored for gastrointestinal problems (0.83). Similarly, of the livestock disease categories, the highest ICF value was scored for skin diseases (0.89), demonstrate the better agreement among informants in the selection of certain medicinal plants, which might be considered as indication of the potency of the plants used in treating such disorders. In the study area, the highest ROP values (100 for each plant) were obtained for  In the Heban-Arsi district, it was discovered that men had better knowledge on the use of medicinal plants than women and that could be attributed to the choice of most traditional healers to transfer their knowledge on the use of medicinal plants along the male line, preferably through their first son. The traditional medical knowledge transfer through the male line is also a common occurrence elsewhere in the country ( The fact that traditional healers possess better knowledge on the use of medicinal plants shows the unevenly distribution of the knowledge among community members in the study area. Study conducted elsewhere also revealed the better knowledge on the use of medicinal plants by traditional healers compared to general informants ( The majority of medicinal plants were reported to be harvested from the wild, which is consistent with results of studies conducted elsewhere in Ethiopian ( Medicinal plants in Heban-Arsi district still play a vital role in fulfilling the primary healthcare needs of community members as revealed by the high diversity of the reported medicinal plant species. Among the various ailments categories, human gastrointestinal disorders and skin disorders of animals scored the highest ICF values.

of helix 2 unwinding in the presence of dATP, we evaluated the α–β
interface as revealed in the previously determined α Considering the conformational
changes in reverse: the binding of two molecules of ATP would destabilize
the α Although
the above mechanism of helix 2 unwinding and rewinding
in the presence of dATP and ATP, respectively, beautifully explains
how the binding surface for the β subunit can alternately be
exposed and tucked away, and all ATP-bound structures show helix 2
fully wound ( We,
therefore, sought a different crystal form for α Allosteric activity regulation
in enzymes
often involves the movement
of side chains in an active site in response to the binding of an
allosteric effector to either increase or decrease enzyme activity.
This more subtle regulation mode does not apply to  A key component of this Rube Goldberg machine is H59. Previously,
Sjöberg and co-workers showed that a H59A variant was not able
to discriminate effectively between dATP and ATP and implicated H59
in triggering allosteric regulation. In terms of stabilizing the α Cartoon representation
for the different states of the cone domain.
(A) dATP-bound cone domain: H59 hydrogen bonds to the ribose (R) hydroxyl
group of dATP (yellow); site 2 is blocked by Phe87 and Trp28; β-hairpin
(black) is anchored down via contacts between dATP and R10 and K9;
and helix 2 (green) is unwound, creating a binding surface for β.
(B) ATP-bound cone domain: H59 does not engage in hydrogen bonding
to site 1 ribose (R) of ATP (pink) and H59 is tilted; F87 and W28
have moved and site 2 is open with bound ATP (gray); the β-hairpin
(black) is pushed up due to the presence of 2ATPs; the strain on helix
2 (green) is decreased and helix 2 is rewound. (C) (Left) the binding
surface for β (orange) is available when dATP (yellow) is bound,
the β-hairpin (black) is tilted down, and a turn of helix 2
is unwound. (Right) the binding surface for β (orange) is unavailable
when two ATP molecules (pink) are bound, the β-hairpin (black)
is tilted up, and helix 2 is fully wound. The molecular mechanism by which ATP frees the
β subunit
from the α The
tilting of the H59 side chain starts a Rube Goldberg-like mechanism
in which H59 movement results in the movement of the side chain of
F87, which in turn results in the movement of the side chain of W28.
With the side chains of F87 and W28 repositioned, the second ATP can
bind to the previously unavailable site 2 ( It is quite impressive from a protein design perspective that a
95-residue domain has two “hideaway” binding sites,
one for a nucleotide effector (site 2) and the other for a protein
subunit and that these sites are in communication. The exposure of
one binding site necessitates that the other is sealed. When ATP is
bound and site 2 is exposed, the β-subunit binding site is tucked
away. Conversely, when dATP is bound and site 2 is tucked away, the
β-subunit binding site is exposed. Importantly, we were able
to demonstrate that site 2 is relevant to allosteric activity regulation
through W28A substitution. Although dATP inhibits W28A RNR in the
absence of any ribonucleoside triphosphate, the addition of ATP or
GTP restores activity for W28A RNR under conditions that are inhibitory
for the wild-type protein. In other words, when site 2 is open, the
identity of the nucleotide in site 1 does not matter. Thus, like the
H59A RNR variant, Parallel
studies show that the  Molecules

Ia RNR would be expected to be successful RNR inhibitors. Notably,

Systemic symptoms of infection, such as fever and chills, were present. There was no accompanying skin rash, arthritis, dysuria, or urethral discharge. He had sought medical attention at a walk-in clinic 5 days prior where he was prescribed a 10-day course of empiric oral clindamycin 500 mg twice daily without symptomatic improvement. His medical history was significant for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sialadenitis, and poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (with a hemoglobin A On examination, he was alert and in no acute distress. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His airway was patent with no stridor, and he talked with a muffled voice. Inspection of the oral cavity showed no tonsillar exudate. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed a normal nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The base of the tongue was erythematous and bulky displacing the epiglottis posteriorly. There was no edema or eythema of the epiglottis, vocal cords, and arytenoids. The airway was not obstructed, and the vocal cords were mobile. Palpation of the anterior neck disclosed a tender swelling overlying the hyoid. Other than for bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, the remainder of the examination was within normal limits. Results of investigations showed no leukocytosis and a negative heterophile antibody test. A chest x-ray showed a normal result. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck disclosed a 3.7 × 3.4 × 2-cm loculated rim-enhancing lesion along the posterior root of the tongue extending to the tongue base with involvement of the peristaltic space with mild thickening of the epiglottis (Fig.  Axial (A) and sagittal (B) CT scan images with contrast showing a lobulated rim-enhancing lesion along the posterior midline root of the tongue extending posteriorly to the base of the tongue and preepiglottic space with stranding of the preepiglottic fat and mild epiglottic thickening.

Because of the clinical concern of the inflammation causing potential airway compromise, he underwent surgical drainage of the abscess. The initial incision and drainage of the abscess via the lingual surface was unsuccessful. Complete resolution of the abscess was achieved by percutaneous drainage superior to the hyoid bone. He was discharged on oral clindamycin pending results of the abscess culture. The isolation of  Further evaluation revealed that his sexual encounters were exclusively heterosexual, with the last exposure occurring 1 month before symptomatic onset in which he engaged in active orogenital contact with an anonymous partner. There was no history of sexually transmitted infections. Screening for concomitant sexually transmitted infections showed no serologic evidence of infection due to HIV, syphilis, hepatitis A, or hepatitis B. A single 250-mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone was administered. Follow-up assessment indicated that complete clinical and radiologic resolution of the thyroglossal duct cyst abscess had occurred. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital anterior neck masses, accounting for 70% of all such congenital neck anomalies. The cyst develops when the thyroglossal duct connecting the developing thyroid gland to its final position in the neck fails to atrophy. The clinical recognition of the cyst differs between children and adults in which an asymptomatic anterior neck mass After radiologic confirmation by either high-resolution ultrasound or CT scans of the neck, Although the most likely pathogens causing thyroglossal duct cyst infections would be anticipated to arise from the endogenous residential oropharyngeal microflora, there is a paucity of literature detailing the organisms isolated from these infections that have included  Our patient is the second case of an infected thyroglossal duct cyst due to  Pharyngeal gonococcal infection and thyroglossal duct cysts share a cryptic clinical feature commonly typified by asymptomatic presentation.

11442807,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Incidence of Notifiable Infectious Diseases in China Based on SARIMA Models Between 2013 and 2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government implemented nationwide public health interventions to control its spread. However, the impact of these measures on other infectious diseases remains unclear. The incidence of three types of notifiable infectious diseases in China were analyzed between 2013 and 2021. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test and Mann-Kendall mutation test were employed to examine trends and mutations in the time series. Based on the counterfactual inference, historical incidence rates were employed to construct SARIMA models and predict incidence between January 2020 and December 2021. Differences between reported and predicted incidences during the pandemic were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Between 2013 and 2019, the incidence rate of three types of notifiable infectious diseases fluctuated between 494.05/100,000 and 550.62/100,000. No discernible trend was observed for types A and B infectious diseases (Z = −1.344,  The public health interventions implemented during the pandemic had a positive consequence on the prevention and control of other infectious diseases, with a particularly notable effect on type C infectious diseases. Among the diseases with different transmission routes, respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases decreased significantly. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s44197-024-00273-x.","Detecting an outbreak of infectious disease is a cornerstone of public health to mitigate risk and prevent further transmission [ In response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government initiated a comprehensive nationwide vaccination program and implemented a series of robust public health interventions, including the use of masks, compulsory home quarantine, restriction of movement, and so on. These measures began with the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January, when all provinces in the country activated the highest response level for public health emergencies [ Despite their many disadvantages, prevention and control measures have been proven to be essential in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases [ Understanding the impact of public health interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on different types of infectious diseases is essential for guiding the prevention and control of infectious diseases in the post-pandemic era [ In this study, we collected data on the incidence of various infectious diseases in China between 2013 and 2021 with additional four quarters of data, in comparison with data from the previous studies. The data were published by the National Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. To quantify the impact of public health interventions on three types of notifiable infectious diseases, we developed time-series models to fit historical incidence rates and compared the reported incidence rates of each type of infectious disease in 2020–2021 with the predicted incidence rates under a counterfactual scenario of no COVID-19 pandemic and related public health interventions. The results of this study would improve our understanding of the effectiveness of public health interventions implemented during the COVID-19 outbreaks in mitigating different types of infectious diseases in China, and provide empirical evidence of behavior change during the pandemic on other infectious diseases. Data on notifiable infectious diseases in China from January 2013 to December 2021 were collected from the official website of the Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan ( The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Infectious Diseases categorises infectious diseases in China into three types (A, B, and C), based on their transmissibility and virulence ranking from high to low. Different types of infectious diseases will be subject to different levels of prevention and control measures. For example, type A infectious diseases, subject to the highest level of disease control measures, require compulsory isolation and treatment for patients, suspected patients and close contacts, and report the infectious disease cases within two hours of diagnosis, while most type B and all type C infectious diseases require to report cases within 24 hours [ To predict the incidence of different types infectious diseases, we used historical data from January 2013 to December 2019 tomake the prediction from 2020 to 2021 with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The predicted incidence was regarded as the scenario without COVID-19 impact. The ARIMA model is commonly used to predict the incidence of various types of infectious diseases [ The models can be classified into various categories including ARIMA (p, d, q) and ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q)  The monthly data from January 2013 to December 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19) were used as a training set to construct ARIMA models. The stationarity of the time series was tested by the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Non-stationary sequences were transformed into stationary sequences by differencing and exponential transformation. The best-fitted model was selected based on the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The model fit was measured by computing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Root mean square error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE), Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R To further validate the accuracy and reliability of the models, we used data from 2013 to 2018 as a training set to predict the incidence rates in 2019. The results were then evaluated by comparing the reported and predicted values and the MAPE values. The optimal model was used to predict the incidence rates from January 2020 to December 2021 as the counterfactual scenario without the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and then the difference between the reported values and the predicted values was used to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on incidence rates of three types of notifiable infectious diseases. Additional analyses were conducted for specific infectious diseases based on their transmission modes to provide a more detailed understanding of the impact of COVID-19 control measures. Specifically, we selected three diseases of high incidence or substantial concern from each of the following transmission categories: respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal or enteric viral diseases, sexually transmitted or blood-borne diseases, and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases. Excel 2016 was utilised for storing the data and performing descriptive analyses (e.g. estimation of incidence) of three types of notifiable infectious diseases. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test was used to examine trends in the incidence of each type of infectious disease, and the Mann-Kendall mutation test was employed to detect sequence mutations [ Between 2013 and 2019, the average annual incidence of three types of notifiable infectious diseases was 525.27/100,000, with an average of 7,223,169 cases per year. The number of cases was the highest in 2018 with 7,653,990 cases reported. The incidence rates of three types of notifiable infectious diseases remained stable between 2013 and 2019. Similarity, the overall trend of types A and B infectious diseases exhibited a slight decline, from 270.96/100,000 in 2013 to 263.66/100,000 in 2019, with no significant fluctuations. The incidence rate of type C infectious diseases increased from 241.45/100,000 in 2013 to 263.31/100,000 in 2019. The results of the seasonal Mann-Kendall test suggested a significant upward trend for type C infectious diseases (Z = 2.56,  However, the results of the Mann-Kendall mutation test indicated a significant change in the incidence of both types A and B, and type C infectious diseases after 2019 (please refer to Appendix 1 for change point). Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of three types of infectious diseases decreased significantly to 367.08/100,000, with the incidence of type C infectious diseases decreasing from 263.31/100,000 in 2019 to 143.29/100,000 in 2020 and types A and B infectious diseases decreasing from 263.66/100,000 to 223.08/100,000 in the same period. The incidence of three types of infectious diseases in 2021 remained at a low level of 434.99/100,000, slightly higher than that in 2020, but lower than that in 2019. The detailed information can be found in Table  
 Number of infections and annual incidence rates of three types of notifiable infectious diseases(except COVID-19 and influenza), 2013–2021 In the process of model construction, due to the widespread outbreak of influenza epidemic in mainland China in 2019, the model fitting was effectively improved after the removal of influenza in this study (please refer to Appendix 2 for model constructions that include influenza). The results of the ADF test indicate that the sequence of types A, B, and C infectious diseases, types A and B, as well as type Cinfectious diseases were stationary ( The results of the residual tests of the above three models showed that the residuals for all three models conformed to the white noise series (Model 1: χ² = 0.29,

 Difference between reported and predicted incidences for infectious diseases with different transmission routes. The black lines represent reported values. The blue line represents predicted values We found that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of three types of notifiable infectious diseases exhibited limited variation. Specifically, the incidence of type C infectious diseases showed a significant upward trend, while the incidence of types A and B infectious diseases remained relatively stable. However, the annual incidence of three types of infectious diseases decreased significantly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the incidence rate of three types of infectious diseases began to decline, with a 15.12% reduction for types A and B infectious disease and a 45.59% reduction for type C infectious diseases. Although there was a slight increase in 2021, it was still lower than the incidence between 2013 and 2019. In addition, there are significant differences in reported and predicted incidence rates of the types of infectious diseases in 2020, and the differences converged in 2021. There is also a significant decrease in respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal or enteroviral diseases, sexually transmitted or bloodborne diseases, and vector-borne or zoonotic diseases during the pandemic. The reasons for the reduction in the dynamics of notifiable diseases are multifactorial [ On the other hand, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government implemented nationwide public health interventions such as using masks, social distancing, and compulsory quarantine. These measures effectively controlled the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevented the transmission of other infectious diseases, resulting in a reduction in their incidence. As COVID-19 was still prevalent in mainland China in 2021, and nationwide public health interventions were still in place, all healthcare facilities, schools, businesses, and many commercial and recreational activities had returned to normal [ The study found that the changes in the difference between reported and predicted values were closely associated with alterations in the intensity of public health interventions with the development of the pandemic.For example, the difference between reported and predicted incidences for three types of notifiable infectious diseases reached a maximum negative value of -53.34% in May 2020, after which it began to contract. For types A and B, the difference was − 45.82% in February 2020. Meanwhile, for type C infectious diseases, the maximum negative value reached − 78.93% in May 2020, after which it also began to contract.This is probably due to the fact that after the Wuhan government declared the city blockade on 23 January 2020, the Chinese government imposed a nationwide highest level of emergency response. As a result, all cities closed their schools, 64.3% of cities banned public gatherings and closed entertainment venues, and 64% of cities banned intercity travel [ In subgroup analyses of transmission routes, we found that TB, scarlet fever, and mumps selected for respiratory diseases, all showed a decrease during the COVID-19 period. The difference in the incidence rate of TB was − 8.87% and − 9.04%, respectively, similar to the − 11.6% reduction in TB cases during the COVID-19 period in Germany [ For sexually transmitted or blood-borne diseases, there was no significant decrease in the differences between reported and predicted values for HIV and gonorrhoea. The difference for syphilis in 2020 and 2021 was − 19.47% and − 22.58%, respectively ( Several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. Firstly, there is potential for underreporting of infectious diseases during the COVID-19 period, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic. Due to reduced availability and accessibility of medical treatment, coupled with public fear, some cases of infectious diseases may not be reported to the national system. Despite the potential underreporting in 2020, our data in 2021, which is less affected by the public fears of infectious diseases and thus less subjective to the underreporting issue, also shows a reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases, providing more valid findings. Secondly, various factors affect the occurrence of infectious diseases (e.g. policies & regulations, migration, and vaccination), and this study, which did not use transmission dynamic models for the prediction, failed to take into account the impact of such factors on the incidence of infectious diseases. However, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, it is unlikely that the reduction of the incidence is due to the change of such factors (e.g. improved coverage of vaccinations). Instead, the reduction in incidence is largely attributable to the control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirdly, this study, with data until December 2021, could not assess the impact of COVID-19 measures in the post-COVID-19 period. Using transmission dynamic models and with the data available for the post-COVID-19 period in the future would address this concern. Our findings suggested that the incidence of all types of infectious diseases in China declined significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, not solely because of the decline in availability and accessibility of medical care and underreporting of infectious diseases, but likely owing to public health interventions that effectively interrupted the transmission of all types of infectious diseases and influenced the epidemic patterns of other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant burden on the national public health system and society, but it served as a wake-up call for increasing public health awareness and investing in public health system. Although national public health measures have been suspended, it is important for the state to strengthen its surveillance of all kinds of infectious diseases and for the local government to increase publicity related to the prevention and control of infectious diseases according to their geographical and seasonal characteristics, and it is recommended that the public maintain good health habits to keep away from infectious diseases.

11442320,"Bacterial sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men and transgender women using oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in Latin America (ImPrEP): a secondary analysis of a prospective, open-label, multicentre study","The global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) poses a challenge in the context of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programmes. We aimed to explore factors associated with prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women on PrEP in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. ImPrEP was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study that enrolled MSM and transgender women in the context of the public health systems of Brazil (14 sites), Mexico (four sites), and Peru (ten sites) between February, 2018, and June, 2021. Eligibility criteria followed regional PrEP guidelines at the study start, including participants aged 18 years and older, not living with HIV, and reporting at least one of the following in the previous 6 months: condomless anal sex (CAS), anal sex with partner(s) living with HIV, any bacterial STI, or transactional sex. Eligible participants were screened and enrolled on the same day to receive daily oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg). We assessed three outcomes: prevalent bacterial STIs, incident bacterial STIs, and recurrent bacterial STIs. Testing occurred at baseline and quarterly for syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, and anorectal gonorrhoea. Behavioural data were collected at baseline and quarterly. The study was registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, U1111-1217-6021. Among all 9509 participants included in the ImPrEP study (3928 [41·3%] in Brazil, 3288 [34·6%] in Mexico, and 2293 [24·1%] in Peru), 8525 (89·7%) had available STI results at baseline and were included in the prevalent STI analysis, and 7558 (79·5%) had available STI results during follow-up and were included in the incident and recurrent STI analyses. 2184 (25·6%) of 8525 participants had any bacterial STI at baseline. STI incidence during follow-up was 31·7 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI 30·7–32·7), with the highest rate for anorectal chlamydia (11·6 cases per 100 person-years, 95% CI 11·0–12·2), followed by syphilis (10·5 cases per 100 person-years, 9·9–11·1) and anorectal gonorrhoea (9·7 cases per 100 person-years, 9·2–10·3). Although only 2391 (31·6%) of 7558 participants had at least one STI during follow-up, 915 (12·1%) participants had recurrent diagnoses, representing 2328 (61·2%) of 3804 incident STI diagnoses. Characteristics associated with prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs included younger age, multiple sex partners, receptive CAS, substance use, and previous STI diagnoses at baseline (incident or recurrent only). Our findings underscore the nuanced dynamics of STI transmission among MSM and transgender women across Latin America, highlighting an urgent need for tailored interventions to mitigate STI burden effectively, especially among the most susceptible individuals. Unitaid, WHO, and ministries of health (Brazil, Mexico, and Peru). For the Portuguese and Spanish translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","According to WHO, 374 million adults globally acquired new infections of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, or thrichomoniasis in 2020. A meta-analysis of PrEP trials that mainly enrolled MSM from high-income locations after 2015 reported a pooled prevalence of any bacterial STI (syphilis, gonorrhoea, or chlamydia) of 23·9% (95% CI 18·6–29·6), with an incidence of 72·2 (95% CI 60·5–86·2) cases per 100 person years. 
 
 We searched PubMed between database inception and April 30, 2024, using the keywords “PrEP” or “pre-exposure prophylaxis”, combined with “sexually transmitted infections” (including “syphilis”, “gonorrhea”, and “chlamydia”), along with geographical qualifiers (“Latin America”, “Brazil”, “Mexico”, and “Peru”). There were no restrictions on publication date or language, resulting in the identification of 38 relevant manuscripts. Our review focused on literature concerning the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among gay, bisexual, and other cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as transgender women, in Latin America. Despite the availability of PrEP through the public health systems of Brazil (since December, 2017), Mexico (since mid-2021), and Peru (since August, 2023), its scale-up remains restricted in the region. We found reports on STI incidence among PrEP users from implementation studies in Brazil and clinical trials such as iPrEX and HPTN083. However, evidence regarding incident STIs in Latin America remains scarce, with most published data primarily focusing on prevalence rates. Notably, none of these studies delved into factors associated with incident and recurrent STIs among PrEP users. Existing data indicate a substantial burden of STIs among MSM and PrEP users in Latin America, particularly syphilis. 
 The Implementation PrEP (ImPrEP) study was the largest PrEP implementation study in Latin America, evaluating the feasibility of same-day oral PrEP in the context of the public health systems of Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. The ImPrEP study reported data on prevalent and incident STIs for 8525 participants, drawing attention to the high prevalence and incidence of bacterial STIs among study participants, including syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, and anorectal gonorrhoea. Age younger than 30 years, self-identification as a non-White race, low educational background, high number of sexual partners, and receptive condomless anal sex (CAS) were associated with baseline prevalence of any bacterial STI. During study follow-up, younger age, non-White race, previous HIV post-exposure prophylaxis use, high number of sexual partners, receptive CAS, use of poppers, and STI diagnosis at enrolment were associated with incident and recurrent bacterial STIs. Regional differences can also be involved in STI transmission dynamics among PrEP users. We found STI incident diagnoses in about 30% of participants and recurrent STI diagnoses in 12% of participants. Participants diagnosed with any STI showed high adherence to PrEP, and reported multiple vulnerabilities related to sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics before starting PrEP. 
 Our findings underscore the substantial burden of STIs in Latin America, reinforcing the role of PrEP services as crucial venues for both diagnosis and timely treatment of these conditions. Furthermore, our findings emphasise the importance of adopting a combined prevention approach. Despite the observed high incidence of STIs, our data suggest that individuals diagnosed with an STI had various vulnerabilities before starting PrEP. Engagement in combination prevention services facilitated regular sexual health assessments, increased testing, awareness, and access to appropriate treatment. Consequently, the expansion of PrEP programmes might be a crucial strategy in curbing both HIV and STI transmission. Moreover, the identification of factors associated with incident and recurrent STIs among PrEP users holds promise for enhancing our understanding of transmission dynamics, which is particularly pertinent given the emergence of new biomedical prevention strategies for bacterial STIs. Few longitudinal studies have analysed incident STIs among PrEP users in Latin America. ImPrEP was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study that enrolled MSM and transgender women in the context of the public health systems in Brazil (14 sites), Mexico (four sites), and Peru (ten sites) between February, 2018, and June, 2021. The study was approved by institutional review boards at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, INI-Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; CAAE:79259517.5.1001.5262), National Institute of Public Health (Mexico City, Mexico; CI-1515), and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (Lima, Peru; 100740). Ethical approval was also obtained from the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee and local institutional review boards at each Brazilian site. All study participants provided written informed consent before enrolment in Portuguese (Brazil) or Spanish (Mexico and Peru). The study was registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials, U1111-1217-6021. Eligible participants were screened and enrolled on the same day to receive daily oral PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg and emtricitabine 200 mg). Follow-up visits were scheduled at week 4 and quarterly (every 3 months) thereafter during the period of study, and at each visit participants were prescribed PrEP, behavioural information was collected, and further examinations were scheduled accordingly. For behavioural information, we used a recall period of 3 months for both the baseline and follow-up visits, except for CAS (recall period of 6 months at the baseline visit, and 3 months for all follow-up visits). Syphilis testing comprised a rapid  Gender was dichotomised into cisgender men and transgender women. We described age at baseline both as numerical (median [IQR]) and categorical ranges (18–24 years, 25–30 years, >30 years). Self-reported race was categorised as non-White (Asian, Black, Indigenous, or mixed-race [Pardo or Mestizo]) versus White. Schooling was stratified into primary, secondary, or post-secondary education. Post-exposure prophylaxis use 12 months before baseline was dichotomised (yes  All STI tests were done at baseline (visit 0) and every 3 months (from visit 2 onwards). Anorectal chlamydia and gonorrhoea was tested annually (visits 0, 6, and 10) until June, 2020, and at every follow-up visit (visit 2, every 3 months) thereafter. Interim visits were done if a participant presented with any adverse events, including STI-related symptoms, and treatment was provided as per the local standard of care. Additional samples for chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing could be collected based on clinical judgement and local availability, but only anorectal samples provided by the study were analysed, with results recorded at the most recent visit. This decision was based on the restricted access to molecular diagnosis in the study countries and the high rates of asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhoea at extragenital sites among MSM and transgender women, particularly anorectal. We assessed three outcomes in this analysis: prevalent bacterial STIs, incident bacterial STIs, and recurrent bacterial STIs. Prevalent bacterial STI was defined as the presence of active syphilis (titres ≥1:8 and a positive microhaemagglutination assay for  Assessment of safety and adverse events during the ImPrEP study has been described elsewhere. Baseline sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of all participants included in the analyses were described. We included all ImPrEP participants who took any bacterial STI test (syphilis or anorectal chlamydia or gonorrhoea) at enrolment in prevalence analysis, whereas only those who attended at least one follow-up visit and had been tested at least once after baseline were considered for incidence or recurrence analysis. We calculated incidence rates with 95% CIs for any bacterial STI and each STI separately, and person-years under follow-up considering time between baseline and the last visit. Bacterial STIs diagnosed at baseline were not included in the numerator of STI incidence rates. We calculated the proportion of any incident bacterial STI (syphilis, anorectal chlamydia, or anorectal gonorrhoea) per participant, and the number of times when any incident bacterial STI was diagnosed after baseline per participant. We calculated the overall STI and STI-specific incidence rates using a Poisson model with the number of person-years of follow-up as the offset. To identify factors associated with prevalent STIs, we used a log-binomial model, interpreting the results as prevalence ratios. For factors related to incident and recurrent STIs, we used a Cox regression model with time-dependent variables, where each participant was followed up from enrolment until event occurrence or censoring. As the hazards in the Cox models with time-dependent variables were no longer proportional, we investigated whether using averaged hazard ratios (HRs) was reasonable for interpreting coefficients related to the explanatory variables over the follow-up period by using the graphical diagnosis of scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Multicollinearity was evaluated using the variance inflation factor, with a threshold of 2·5. The analyses were done in two stages. Initially, we evaluated each risk factor while controlling solely for country. Factors statistically significant at the 10% level were then included in the final models, where the interpretation was made in terms of the association measures and their respective 95% CIs. Given the limited advantages of imputing outcome variable values, we did not impute missing values of the STI variable at baseline for the prevalent STI analysis. Since baseline STI was an explanatory variable in the incident and recurrent STI analyses, missing values were addressed through multiple imputation. This process used variables measured at baseline and behavioural time-dependent variables measured at each quarterly visit, generating 20 imputed datasets via the predictive mean matching method, considering the longitudinal data structure, with the 2lonly.norm command available in the Mice package of the R software. Statistical analyses were done with R (version 4.2.2). The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Among all 9509 participants included in the ImPrEP study, 8525 (89·7%) had available STI results at baseline and were included in the prevalent STI analysis (3640 [92·7%] in Brazil, 2671 [81·2%] in Mexico, and 2214 [96·6%] in Peru). Participants were mostly cisgender men, aged younger than 30 years, non-White, and had post-secondary education ( Sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of ImPrEP participants Data are n (%), unless otherwise indicated.

Prevalent STI diagnosis was higher among participants of younger age (18–30 years), of non-White race, with primary or secondary education, attending the service not seeking PrEP, reporting more than one sex partner, and reporting receptive CAS ( Factors associated with prevalent, incident, and recurrent STI diagnoses among ImPrEP participants CAS=condomless anal sex.

For the incident and recurrent analyses, we included 7558 (79·5%) of 9509 ImPrEP participants who had at least one STI test during follow-up visits (Brazil: 3447 [45·6%] participants; Mexico: 2486 [32·9%] participants; Peru: 1625 [21·5%] participants). 1796 (23·8%) of 7558 participants were lost to follow-up, including 69 individuals who acquired HIV before any STI was detected. Overall, 7211 (95·4%) of 7558 participants were cisgender MSM and 347 (4·6%) were travesti or transgender women, and 4230 (56·0%) were aged 30 years or younger. Those not included in the incident and recurrent STI analyses were more frequently from Mexico and Peru compared with Brazil, transgender women versus cisgender men, aged 18–24 years versus older than 24 years, and non-White versus White, and more likely to have secondary education or lower versus post-secondary education ( Participants were followed up for a total of 11 959·9 person-years after enrolment. Overall, the follow-up period ranged from 0·2 to 3·3 years, with a median follow-up of 1·6 years (IQR 0·8–2·3). Participants without STIs had a shorter median follow-up compared with those diagnosed with any bacterial STI (1·4 years, IQR 0·7–2·1  Incident bacterial STIs diagnosed per participant during the ImPrEP study Data are n (%). STI=sexually transmitted infection. Number of bacterial STIs diagnosed during ImPrEP study follow-up according to the proportion of diagnoses per participant STI=sexually transmitted infection. Incident bacterial STIs were higher among participants from Mexico, those aged 18–24 years, those who self-identified as non-White, those who reported previous post-exposure prophylaxis use at baseline, those who reported multiple sex partners since the last visit, those who reported receptive CAS, those who reported use of poppers, and those with previous STI diagnosis at baseline ( Recurrent bacterial STIs were higher among those aged 18–24 years, those who reported multiple sex partners since the last visit, those who reported use of poppers, and those with previous STI diagnosis at baseline ( The characteristics of participants included in incident and recurrent STI analyses were similar across countries, with some differential losses among participants with increased vulnerability to HIV or other STIs ( In this large cohort of MSM and transgender women using oral PrEP in Latin America, we found a high burden of STIs, especially among those aged 18–30 years, those with secondary education or lower, and those self-identifying as non-White. Substance use, previous post-exposure prophylaxis prescription, transactional sex, and self-reported behavioural characteristics, including high frequency of CAS and a higher number of sex partners, were associated with increased probabilities of being diagnosed with any bacterial STI at baseline, before PrEP initiation, and during follow-up, after PrEP initiation. International cohorts also reported similar factors associated with incident and recurrent bacterial STI diagnoses after PrEP initiation, including younger age, higher number of sexual partners, CAS, and substance use. Our data indicate a high concentration of bacterial STI diagnoses among a small proportion of individuals, as more than 70% of participants had no bacterial STI diagnosis during follow-up. 12% of participants accounted for 61% of all incident bacterial STIs diagnosed during the study follow-up, and recurrent STI diagnoses were more frequent among those of younger age (18–24 years), with a higher number of sex partners, and reporting poppers use. Moreover, being diagnosed with any bacterial STI at baseline posed an increased risk of incident and recurrent STIs during study follow-up. These findings might help to identify individuals in Latin America who could benefit most from biomedical technologies aiming to prevent bacterial STIs, such as the use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis. The high rates of incident and recurrent bacterial STIs are in line with the regional landscape, since Latin America faces epidemics of HIV and STIs, especially syphilis, which disproportionally burden MSM and transgender women. Additionally, the HPTN083 study, which evaluated long-acting injectable PrEP with cabotegravir among 4566 MSM and transgender women, of whom 1964 (43%) were from Latin America, also found high STI incidence (50·7 cases per 100 person-years), which was highest in Africa (75 cases per 100 person-years) and Latin America (63·9 cases per 100 person-years). Syphilis and rectal chlamydia had equal incidence rates (16·7 cases per 100 person-years), followed by rectal gonorrhoea (11 cases per 100 person-years), with few cases of urogenital chlamydia (4·5 cases per 100 person-years) or gonorrhoea (2·4 cases per 100 person-years). Similar with our data, about 60% of participants had no STI diagnosis during the study, and almost 80% of all STI diagnoses were found in only 25% of participants. Our study has several limitations. We did not collect multisite swab samples for chlamydia or gonorrhoea and tested for these infections less frequently compared with syphilis, which might have led to underestimation of chlamydia and gonorrhoea rates. We did not systematically conduct tests of cure nor systematically collect information on STI treatment. We used laboratory cure criteria as a proxy for STI resolution by comparing previous and incident bacterial STI, potentially underestimating new diagnoses. Higher proportions of participants reporting STI-related vulnerabilities (eg, younger age, non-White race, and lower education) were not included in incidence analysis, which could have underestimated incidence rates in the ImPrEP study. The HR for assessing the association between risk factors and STI incidence could be affected by selection bias due to unequal weighting of early and late HRs. Although almost a quarter of participants were lost to follow-up, this bias is mitigated by the relatively short median follow-up period of 1·6 years and similar follow-up times regardless of STI diagnosis. Self-reported data on sexual behaviour and substance use might be subject to recall bias, and our analyses could be affected by unmeasured confounders. Previous data suggest that participants from Mexico and Peru, transgender women, those identifying as non-White, those with lower education, those with fewer sex partners, those with no history of transactional sex, and those younger than 30 years have increased odds of early loss to follow-up. Our cohort is highly representative of MSM and transgender women using oral PrEP in Latin America and brings important data on prevalent, incident, and recurrent STIs and their associated risk factors. Overtly, data from ImPrEP contribute to further describing the landscape of bacterial STIs among MSM and transgender women in Latin America, providing data on molecular diagnosis of STIs among these key populations in the region. In conclusion, our results add to a growing body of evidence that monitors data on STIs in Latin America, outlining the importance of age, sexual behaviour, and substance use in further understanding the dynamics of STI transmission in the region. Our findings suggest an already high vulnerability to STIs at PrEP initiation, and incidence of recurrent STIs among a specifc group of individuals as the main drivers of the high burden of bacterial STIs among people on PrEP. Therefore, the intertwining of person-centred approaches to adequately identify those more vulnerable to bacterial STIs, comprehensive sexual health assessments in PrEP programmes, and intersectional actions to tackle insufficient sex education and the burden of mental health conditions and substance use are crucial to curb the HIV and STI syndemic in Latin America.

While rare, bacterial infections such as those from ","Liver abscesses are usually polymicrobial, with the most common bacterial infections caused by  Most reports on  A 19-year-old female presented initially to the emergency department (ED) complaining of two days of fever and one day of pelvic pain. Maximum axillary temperature taken was 103 F. She denied any other associated factors. She visited her OB/GYN the prior week where physical exam and urinalysis were within normal limits. Workup in the ED revealed urinalysis with positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and bacteria. Pregnancy test was negative. Abdominal X-ray with findings compatible with fecal retention but otherwise unremarkable. She tested positive for influenza B and was discharged with oseltamivir treatment to continue as an outpatient for five days. One week later, the patient returned to the ED as her fever persisted despite oseltamivir and now presented a two-day course of sharp right flank pain, rated 7/10, worsened with movement. At the time she denied nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Upon further questioning, her mother endorsed a past medical history of recurrent  An abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds were ordered. The pelvic report showed complex bilateral adnexal collections, the right ovary measured 5.3 x 4.6 x 3.5 cm, calculated volume of 45.4 mL. The left ovary measured 7.4 x 5.3 x 5.0 cm, calculated volume of 102.6 mL.” These findings were concerning for pylosalpinx.  The abdominal ultrasound showed enlarged kidneys (2 SD above for age) with preserved anatomy and a heterogeneous mass in the right liver lobe with internal flow upon Doppler interrogation measuring approximately 10.0 x 7.6 x 9.3 cm. Also found to have hepatomegaly with a longitudinal span of 21 cm. Basic workup revealed leukocytosis, elevated liver transaminases, and elevated C-reactive protein. Urinalysis was similar to the one observed on the initial visit. Out of concerns for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as bilateral pylosalpinx was observed, she was started on standard treatment with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole. Blood culture was obtained and remained negative at 48 hours; urine culture turned positive at 24 hours for pansensitive  She was admitted for further workup of the hepatic imaging representing a likely abscess. A vaginal and pelvic exam was done which demonstrated negative cervical motion tenderness exam. Cervical swabs were taken for  An MRI to further characterize the hepatic lesion reported the liver measuring 23 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. A large lobulated complex collection with multiple septations measuring 10.5 x 8.1 x 10.1 cm was found in the right lobe. Also reported bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses with small amount of pelvic free fluid (Figure  Infectious disease service recommended continuing with the current treatment. The differential diagnosis included a pyogenic abscess, a hydatid cyst or amebic abscess, although the latter was less likely as no epidemiological risk factors were observed. Her clinical picture did not improve despite antibiotic treatment. She persisted with abdominal pain and fevers throughout the day, especially at night. She remained distended and with hepatomegaly. On day five of admission, interventional radiology performed a percutaneous drainage of the lesion and a total of 310 cc of frank pus were removed, collapsing the cavity. The pus became blood-tinged at the end. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB), fungal, aerobic, and anaerobic cultures were obtained. A post-drainage ultrasound reported an interval decrease in the size of the previously seen complex abscess measuring approximately 9.2 x 8.8 cm. The hemoglobin dropped to 7.3 g/dL so she was started on oral iron supplementation. She improved significantly after drainage of the abscess. Her fever curve decreased and she no longer presented fevers at night. Her abdominal pain decreased significantly although it was still present especially while moving. She was able to eat and ambulate as usual. Since One week later repeat ultrasounds reported reduction of the right ovary size, measured at 3.6 x 3.3 x 2.0 cm with a calculated volume of 12.6 mL (previously 45 mL), and the left ovary measured 6.0 x 4.7 x 3.3 cm with a calculated volume of 49.4 mL (previously 103 mL). Regarding the hepatic abscess, the lesion measured approximately 5.4 x 6.3 x 5.4 cm. Previously the lesion was measured at 9.6 x 8.8 x 8.3 cm. The liver remained enlarged measuring 19.1 cm in length. Her overall inflammatory markers improved and clinically she reported improvement in her abdominal pain. The patient returned for follow-up after 23 days of ceftriaxone via PICC line. At the time of follow-up she endorsed an erythematous rash that responded to antihistamine treatment therefore she was switched to oral, high-dose amoxicillin. On day 28 of antibiotics, she continued with the dermatological reaction. At that time, labs showed a decrease in both WBC and inflammatory markers therefore antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On her follow-up visit two months after discharge, she reported feeling well overall. Repeat ultrasound of the ovaries showed a right ovary that measured 3.3 x 2.9 x 2.4 cm, a calculated volume of 12.2 mL. The left ovary measured 4.4 x 2.4 x 2.4 cm, a calculated volume of 13.4 mL, thus improving from previous study. Liver ultrasound showed a decrease in size of the known right hepatic lobe lesion, measuring 2.4 x 1.8 x 2.3 cm versus 4.6 x 4.5 x 3.3 cm on prior exam. No new lesions were identified. Right longitudinal liver span is 15.0 cm, which is the upper limit of normal. Last follow-up appointment about four months after intervention proved no evidence of the hepatic mass and no distortion in overall architecture of the liver. There is little evidence of Streptococcus constellatus infection in the immunocompetent pediatric population. The Streptococcus anginosus group are opportunistic pathogens that can lead to severe pyogenic infections. They are found in the oral, digestive, pulmonary, and urinary tract. In a case report published in 2021 by Vulisha et al., a 59-year-old male presented with a cavitary lung lesion formed by Streptococcus constellatus that was complicated by empyema. The abscess formation in this patient was secondary to a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient was treated with 35 days of ertapenem [ Risk factors for opportunistic infections such as this one include being an elderly male, smoking history, alcohol abuse, neoplastic disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disorders, hematologic disorders, heart failure, HIV, trauma, surgical procedures, and even periodontal disease [ Liver abscesses are predominantly classified as either bacterial or amoebic. The majority are reported to be polymicrobial with E. coli and K. pneumoniae as the most commonly isolated bacteria. Septic emboli can lead to abscesses and various reports reveal hematogenous spread from endocarditis, pyelonephritis, and diverticulitis sources. Liver abscesses from amoebic sources are commonly due to Entamoeba histolytica which often seeds into the portal system. An even rarer form of liver abscesses can stem from parasitic Echinococcus granulosus causing a hydatid cyst [ Failing to diagnose and appropriately treat pyogenic liver abscesses can be fatal. Right upper quadrant ultrasound can be a useful tool to visualize hepatic lesions, but it fails to accurately detect small focal lesions. Abdominal CT scan provides a more accurate view of hepatic lesions in various phases that may demonstrate the rim-enhancement or cavitary lesions in better light. The use of both modalities increases diagnostic capabilities [ Ultrasound and CT can also be used to drain the abscess. In small abscesses that are less than 5 mm, simple needle aspiration may be sufficient. Abscesses larger than 5 mm may require catheter placement for drainage of pus. Surgery is particularly helpful in cases of peritonitis. Finally, cultures and sensitivities will aid in determining the best course of management [ There are several treatment strategies when it comes to pyogenic liver abscesses. Empiric treatment begins with broad-spectrum antibiotics, usually third-generation cephalosporins and metronidazole. In a report by Riaz et al., an adult patient was found to have two complex liver abscesses of S. constellatus and was treated with two weeks of parenteral antibiotics through PICC line [ The clinical presentation of abdominal pain and refractory fevers observed in this patient can include a variable list of etiologies. While delving deeper into the physical exam and the various studies performed to determine the cause of her hepatomegaly, it is important to keep bacterial abscess formation in the differential. Although a healthy, immunocompetent adolescent, the drainage of the abscess yielded a rare form of Streptococcus that was sensitive to cephalosporins. Treatment with ceftriaxone for 23 days via the PICC line and oral amoxicillin thereafter helped achieve improvement of symptoms at the two-month follow-up.

11438915,"Knowledge of Sexually Transmitted Infections and Its Association With Condom Use Self-Efficacy (CUSES) Among People Living With HIV (PLHIV) in Public Health Clinics in Selangor, Malaysia","Background Condom use self-efficacy is critical in preventing the spread of HIV among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is a crucial factor in promoting safer sexual behaviors. However, there is scarce data on its association with condom use self-efficacy, particularly among PLHIV. Objectives This study aims to determine the association between knowledge of STIs and other demographic and behavioral factors with condom use self-efficacy among PLHIV in public health clinics at Hulu Langat, Selangor. Methods A cross-sectional study involved PLHIV attending public health clinics in Selangor, Malaysia. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, able to read and comprehend the Malay language, and having not been diagnosed with psychiatric illness or learning difficulties that may impede their ability to answer the questionnaire. Data were collected from December 2023 to March 2024 through self-administered questionnaires assessing demographic characteristics, sexual practice, clinical factors, knowledge of STIs, and condom use self-efficacy. Multiple linear regressions were performed to identify factors associated with condom use self-efficacy. Results The mean score for condom use self-efficacy was 77.72 ± 12.88, and the mean score for knowledge of STIs was 30.87 ± 5.50. The higher STI knowledge score was associated with higher condom use self-efficacy (B = 0.73, p < 0.001). Other significant factors were higher household income (B = 9.27, p < 0.001), recent sexual activity within the last three months (B = -4.34, p < 0.001), engaging in receptive anal sex (B = 7.06, p < 0.001), and not using a condom during the last sexual intercourse (B = -4.43, p < 0.001) were associated with condom use self-efficacy. Conclusion The study confirms that good STI knowledge increases condom use self-efficacy among PLHIV, therefore highlighting the need to educate those at risk with better knowledge of STIs. It also highlights the importance of conducting interventions for those at higher risk due to lower condom use self-efficacy and exploring their barriers towards the use of condoms.","HIV infection still poses a great challenge in curbing and controlling the spread of the virus. According to the AIDS Monitoring Report, Malaysia recorded 86,142 people living with HIV (PLHIV), with an annual incidence of 3,177 by the end of 2022. The state of Selangor exhibited the highest concentration of cases, representing 31% of the national total, with 966 new infections, 135 AIDS cases, and 145 deaths within one year [ Condom use has been identified as one of the most effective means of preventing the spread of HIV [ “Condom use self-efficacy"" is defined as an individual's confidence in their ability to use a condom correctly [ Knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is linked to condom use [ Study design and population A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult HIV patients who attended three public health clinics in Selangor, Malaysia, using a self-administered questionnaire (Appendix). The data collection period was from December 2023 until March 2024. The participants recruited were PLHIV who were adults (18 years and older) and able to read and comprehend the Malay language. They may have been diagnosed with HIV at any time before the data collection. Those who have been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or learning difficulties that impede their ability to complete the questionnaire were excluded from the study. Sample size calculation. Sample size calculation The sample size estimation was based on a study by Rahim et al., which indicated that 53% of PLHIV had high condom use self-efficacy scores. Using this prevalence, the formula estimated a required sample size of 369 with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Considering a 20% non-response rate, the final calculated sample size was adjusted to 442. Sampling method and data collection The sample population included all PLHIV who attended the selected public health clinics during the data collection period. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from PLHIV attending the three public health clinics with a dedicated HIV clinic. The researcher approached potential participants in the waiting area, introduced the study, and invited interested PLHIV to participate. Those who agreed were taken to a separate room, screened for eligibility, and provided with the study information sheets and consent forms. All participants were given time to read through the study information sheets, sign the consent form, and complete the self-administered questionnaire. This questionnaire consisted of sociodemographics, clinical factors, knowledge of STIs, and condom use self-efficacy. Knowledge of STIs was measured using a validated tool in the Malay language, and the condom-use self-efficacy scale (CUSES) Malay version was used to measure condom-use self-efficacy. They were assured of anonymity and confidentiality and that their responses would not affect their clinical care. Participants filled out the questionnaires in a separate area and were given pens and clipboards. The researcher was available to answer questions during data collection. After completing the questionnaires, participants returned them to the researcher and received pamphlets on safe sexual practices. Study tool The questionnaire consists of five sections. Section A consists of sociodemographic data comprising factors such as gender, date of birth, age, ethnicity, marital status, level of education, religion, and employment status. Section B consisted of questions on the sexual practices of the participants, and Section C contained questions on clinical characteristics such as treatment status and viral suppression.  Section D is the validated Malay questionnaire that measures the participants’ knowledge of STI. The questionnaire was developed in the Malay language by Mansor et al., and it has good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha of 0.878) [ Section E is the Malay version of the 'Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale', also known as CUSES, that consists of 27 self-administered items. The original English version was developed by Brafford and Beck in 1991 to assess college students’ conviction in their ability to properly apply and negotiate the use of a condom during sexual activity [ Statistical analysis IBM Corp. Released 2021. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. was used for data entry and statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation (SD), frequency, and percentage were used to summarize sociodemographic, clinical, and sexual practices as well as the score of STI knowledge and condom use self-efficacy. We conducted both simple and multiple linear regression analyses to examine the factors associated with condom use self-efficacy. Variables with a p-value less than 0.05 in the simple linear regression were included in the stepwise multiple linear regression model. The stepwise method was preferred for its ability to iteratively add and remove variables based on significance, resulting in a more efficient and parsimonious model with improved predictive accuracy and reduced multicollinearity. This approach balances the strengths of both forward selection and backward elimination while avoiding the drawbacks of including non-significant variables, as seen in the standard enter method. The analysis detected multicollinearity between the variables 'sexual orientation’ and ‘type of sexual practice’ as shown by its high variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10. To address this issue, the variable ‘sexual orientation’ was removed from the final model as it was deemed less theoretically important. To ensure the validity of the multiple linear regression model, several assumptions were checked. Scatterplots and residual plots used confirmed the linearity between the dependent and independent variables. The Durbin-Watson value was 1.59, indicating the independence of the residuals. There was homoscedasticity, as assessed by visual inspection of a plot of standardized predicted values. The residuals were normally distributed, as evidenced by the bell-shaped histogram. The statistical significance level was set at a p-value less than 0.05. Ethical consideration The study was conducted following the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University Teknologi MARA (UITM), and the Malaysia Research Ethical Committee (MREC). Informed consent was secured from all participants before their inclusion in the study. Participants were provided with comprehensive information about the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits. They were assured of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences to their medical treatment. The anonymity and confidentiality of the participant's data were strictly maintained throughout the study. Data was securely stored, and only the research team had access to it. A total of 375 PLHIV were approached. Three of the PLHIV refused to participate in the study, yielding 84% of the response rate. All 372 of the participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria, completed the questionnaire, and were included in the final analysis. The average age of the participants was 38.23 ± 11.30 years. As shown in Table  The data has been presented as n (%) for categorical variables and mean ± SD for continuous variables.

Model assumption was fulfilled. Multicollinearity was assessed.  R2: 0.307. Bb: Adjusted regression coefficient, CI: Confidence interval, STI: Sexually transmitted infection The findings of our study indicate that the CUSES score among PLHIV in Hulu Langat, Selangor, is moderately high at 77.72 ± 12.88, corresponding to 72.0% of the maximum possible score. This suggests that while overall self-efficacy in condom use is relatively good, there is still room for improvement, particularly in areas identified by the subdomain scores. The ""Mechanics"" and ""Assertiveness"" subdomains showed high levels of confidence, indicating good practical skills and assertiveness in condom use. However, the ""Perceived barrier"" and ""Intoxicant"" subdomains revealed lower scores, highlighting potential challenges related to perceived obstacles and the impact of intoxicants on condom use efficacy. Comparing our results with other studies, it is evident that the self-efficacy scores can vary significantly across different populations and cultural contexts. For instance, Hamid et al. reported a slightly higher mean CUSES score of 82.93 ± 14.29 among youth attending RVD/STI clinics [ STI knowledge and condom use self-efficacy Our study revealed that the overall mean score of STI knowledge among PLHIV was 30.87 ± 5.50, representing 81.2% of the maximum possible score. This high score indicates a substantial level of awareness and understanding of STIs among the participants. These findings suggest that PLHIV has higher levels of STI knowledge compared to other studies in other populations in Malaysia [ Higher STI knowledge is significantly associated with higher condom use self-efficacy among PLHIV. This finding is consistent with other research but among a more general population. For example, Ma et al. found that better knowledge of STIs was positively associated with consistent condom use [ Household income One of the key findings was that people living with HIV who have a household income of RM10960 or above tend to have higher condom use self-efficacy scores. This finding aligns with studies done by Li et al., which found that better income is associated with better condom use behavior [ Receptive anal sexual practice We also found that engaging in receptive anal sexual practices was significantly associated with higher condom use self-efficacy. PLHIV who practice receptive anal sex have a higher awareness of their increased risk for HIV and other STIs, as shown in previous studies done by Ye et al. and Wang et al. [ Sexual activity and condom use behavior Not using a condom during the last sexual intercourse was negatively associated with condom use self-efficacy. The failure to use a condom may reinforce a lack of confidence in one’s ability to use condoms, thereby lowering self-efficacy. Previous research indicates that individuals who do not use condoms consistently may have lower self-efficacy regarding their use [ Finally, our study found that being less sexually active is associated with lower condom use self-efficacy. Similar trends have been observed in the study by Aventin et al. in Southern Africa [ Limitations of the study This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to infer causality between the factors studied and condom use self-efficacy. Longitudinal studies would be beneficial in establishing causal relationships. Second, the use of self-reported data may introduce social desirability bias, potentially leading to over- or under-reporting of sexual behaviors and condom use. Third, the study was conducted in public health clinics within the Hulu Langat District, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other regions or settings in Malaysia. Lastly, the convenience sampling method may not fully represent the broader population of PLHIV. Implication for clinical practice and future research Clinically, it is important to effectively increase condom use self-efficacy among PLHIV through enhancing STI knowledge and applying targeted interventions among those with lower income and those who are less sexually active. For populations with lower income, it is crucial to develop tailored educational programs that focus on safe sex practices and comprehensive STI knowledge. These programs should address the specific barriers to condom use. Utilizing community outreach and local resources can significantly enhance the dissemination and impact of this information. Reaching out to these communities will enable them better confidence to practice safer sex when required.  Second, it is important not to overlook individuals who are less sexually active. Our study has shown that those who have not been sexually active PLHIV have lower condom use self-efficacy. While less sexual activity may reduce the risk of transmission, it is crucial to ensure that these individuals feel confident and prepared to use condoms if they choose to engage in sexual activity. Providing ongoing education and support can help build their confidence and preparedness, ensuring they can practice safe sex when the time comes. Given that this research was conducted within a small setting of those attending HIV clinics in one district, it is essential to broaden the scope of future studies to include other PLHIV populations, especially among those in the community or defaulters. The expansion will help ensure that the findings are generalizable and applicable to a wider community. With proper sampling techniques, such as randomized sampling, it would be better to enhance the representativeness and reliability of the results. This approach will help mitigate any biases and improve the overall validity of the findings. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the factors associated with condom use self-efficacy among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Malaysia. The study highlights the significant role of STI knowledge, sexual activity, and demographic factors in influencing condom use self-efficacy. Despite the limitations, the results underscore the importance of sexual education and targeted interventions to enhance condom use self-efficacy, thereby promoting safer sexual practices among PLHIV.","['primary care', 'sexual behavior', 'sti knowledge', 'plhiv', 'condom use self-efficacy']",,Cureus,Gonorrhea
11438551,Risperidone-Induced Urinary Incontinence in Schizoaffective Disorder: A Case Report,"Risperidone is a widely used atypical antipsychotic known for its efficacy in managing various psychiatric conditions. However, it is not without adverse effects, and one such underreported side effect is that of urinary incontinence. This case report highlights the experience of a 59-year-old gentleman with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder who, after being admitted due to a relapse of his symptoms, developed urinary incontinence with risperidone. The patient's symptoms resolved upon the gradual reduction of the risperidone dose to 2 mg at bedtime. Urinary incontinence as a side effect of antipsychotics has been documented in children, especially in those with autism or developmental disorders, but there is limited research on its occurrence in adults. Urinary incontinence can have significant social and psychological impacts on patients, leading to feelings of embarrassment and social withdrawal. It can also contribute to treatment non-adherence leading to frequent relapses and exacerbations of psychiatric symptoms. In managing patients with risperidone-induced urinary incontinence, it is essential to explore medical causes thoroughly before considering medication changes. Behavioral modifications such as bladder training, biofeedback, and lifestyle modifications can also be effective in reducing the frequency of incontinence episodes. This case report emphasizes the importance of prompt identification and intervention to minimize the debilitating effects of urinary incontinence on patients with psychiatric conditions.","Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic medication. It is indicated for use in a variety of psychiatric conditions, and these conditions include but are not limited to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, delusional disorders, and autism-associated irritability [ This is the case of a 59-year-old Syrian gentleman who was brought by his wife to our emergency department due to a two-week history of persecutory delusions, an elated mood, restlessness, and overspending. This is on the background of a 20-year history of schizophrenia and a one-month history of medication noncompliance. Our patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1998 and was reported to be stable on Zuclopenthixol 100 mg IM, administered every two weeks. However, due to the war-torn conditions of his home country of Syria, our patient immigrated and, as a result, was lost to his usual follow-ups. He also missed a month of medications. Collateral history from our patient’s wife highlighted a two-week history of paranoid and persecutory delusions pertaining to his family members, the content of which included beliefs that his family members are possessed by evil spirits as well as partaking in illicit drug use. The patient also believed that he was being tracked by various governmental bodies. This escalated when he began threatening to burn his house and, soon enough, began switching on the gas and stove in the kitchen. He also tried to injure his wife and daughter with lit cigarettes. He was also noted to be extremely irritable, easily provoked, and recklessly overspending when it came to his finances. Of note, he had no past medical history, no known allergies, and no history of substance misuse. He was admitted to an acute psychiatric ward after medical clearance. Over the course of his inpatient interviews, in addition to his persecutory delusions, the team noted an increase in sexual-oriented topics, elated mood, inflated self-esteem, increased energy levels despite a lack of sleep, talkativeness, and grandiose delusions. As a result, under the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was placed. He was started on risperidone at 2 mg PO bedtime, with the dose gradually increasing to 6 mg PO bedtime over the course of three weeks. Five days later, the patient began to complain of urinary incontinence, stating that it interrupted his daily prayers as a practicing Muslim and interrupted his sleep, occurring more than six times at night. The medical workup was unremarkable. Upon gradual reduction of the dose of Risperidone to 2 mg PO Bedtime, his incontinence ceased. Our patient was stabilized on a regimen of risperidone 2 mg PO bedtime, sodium valproate 500 mg PO BID, and long-acting paliperidone 100 mg IM every four weeks. The aim of this report is to draw attention to the frequently neglected yet noteworthy side effects of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. The preexisting documented cases in the literature of urinary incontinence related to risperidone use have been limited to children, particularly those with autism or other developmental conditions, with the few documented cases predominantly in the United States. To our knowledge, this would be the first reported case of risperidone-induced urinary incontinence in an adult in the Middle Eastern region. Urinary incontinence as a side effect of antipsychotics, as per studies, has an incidence of less than 0.23-30% and a prevalence of 1-42% [ A cohort study done in New Zealand concluded that the incidence rate of nocturnal enuresis in patients taking atypical antipsychotics was 20% for clozapine, 9.6% for olanzapine, 6.7% for quetiapine, and 6.2% for risperidone [ Despite its importance, limited research has focused on the exact mechanism responsible for this side effect. In the case of risperidone, alpha-1-adrenergic blockade has been proposed as a potential mechanism for urinary incontinence due to its function of regulating the internal bladder sphincter [ Its active form, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, can be directly taken via paliperidone, which has weaker effects on these receptors compared to risperidone [ Urinary incontinence can also have a significant impact on both patients and caregivers. Adding to the stigma of the preexisting psychiatric illness, the side effect of incontinence could be a factor leading to episodes of indignity and humiliation. For patients who are dependent on caregivers, managing hygiene frequently becomes a challenge, which can eventually increase the risk of caregiver fatigue and burnout. The episodes can also prompt patients to be more socially withdrawn to avoid further instances of incontinence in outdoor settings. Some patients might refrain from reporting this issue, possibly due to feeling embarrassed about discussing it with medical staff. Clinicians should also keep in mind urinary incontinence as a causative factor for relapses, as it can by itself lead to non-adherence to treatment [ In psychiatry, prioritizing the prevention of incontinence and providing timely treatment can significantly ease the journey of patients through their illness. Doing so not only reduces feelings of embarrassment but also boosts self-confidence and enhances social acceptance. When a patient presents with new-onset urinary incontinence, it is imperative to explore medical causes thoroughly before considering medication changes. Recommended practice highlights the need to exclude common causes of urinary incontinence, such as infections caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, acute cystitis, diabetes mellitus, or, in males, prostatic enlargement. Medication interactions, as well as the consideration of over-the-counter drugs, should be explored as well [ Some case studies highlight medication management for patients unable to tolerate a decrease in dose or a change in medication. Medications that have been used include oxybutynin, pseudoephedrine, mirabegron, imipramine, and duloxetine, as well as Botox injections [ However, it is recommended that providers educate patients on behavioral modifications to reduce the frequency of the incontinence episodes, such as bladder training, biofeedback, pelvis muscle exercises, timed and/or prompted voiding, lifestyle modifications that are inclusive of fluid management, caffeine reduction, and symptom relief [ A 59-year-old gentleman diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder developed urinary incontinence after being prescribed risperidone. The patient's symptoms resolved upon the gradual reduction of the risperidone dose to 2 mg at bedtime. This case report highlights the underreported side effects of risperidone-induced urinary incontinence, particularly in adults. Prompt identification and intervention are crucial to minimize the debilitating social and psychological effects of urinary incontinence on patients with psychiatric conditions.","['psychopharmacology', 'medication side-effects', 'antipsychotics', 'urinary incontinence', 'risperidone']",,Cureus,Gonorrhea
11437999,Discussion on the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of uterine artery blood flow parameters and serum PLGF and sFlt-1 in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion,"To investigate the effects of different drug treatments on uterine artery blood flow parameters, serum placental growth factor (PLGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and sFlt-1/PLGF in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion and to explore the predictive value of uterine artery blood flow parameters, serum PLGF, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1/PLGF for pregnancy outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included 173 patients who experienced recurrent spontaneous abortion and 100 control patients. Patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion were divided into an aspirin group (75 patients), aspirin combined with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) group (68 patients), and non-drug group (30 patients) based on different drug treatments. Uterine artery blood flow parameters at gestational weeks 30-31 1. Uterine artery blood flow parameters at gestational weeks 30-31 Aspirin and aspirin combined with LMWH can upregulate serum PLGF and decrease serum sFlt-1 levels in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion, reduce the miscarriage rate, and significantly improve pregnancy outcomes. The combination of serum PLGF, sFlt-1, sFlt-1/PLGF, and uterine artery blood flow parameters can effectively predict hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.","According to the expert consensus on recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) in China, recurrent spontaneous abortion is defined as the loss of pregnancy, including biochemical pregnancy, occurring two or more times with the same spouse, all before the 28th week of gestation [ Recent studies have shown that the main causes of miscarriage in pregnant women are endothelial dysfunction and placental ischemia-hypoxia [ Uterine artery blood flow perfusion can be indirectly observed clinically through uterine artery blood flow parameters, including the pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI), and peak systolic velocity/end diastolic velocity (S/D ratio). Currently, there is no unified standard for the clinical treatment of recurrent spontaneous abortion. Studies have shown that aspirin can inhibit platelet aggregation, prevent the formation of microthrombi, and have a good antiplatelet effect. LMWH inhibits the activity of coagulation factors, reduces blood viscosity, and improves blood circulation. Both can also reduce trophoblast cell apoptosis. A large number of studies have reported that aspirin and LMWH can improve pregnancy outcomes in patients with recurrent miscarriage. This study aimed to monitor changes in uterine artery blood flow parameters and serum PLGF and sFlt-1 concentrations in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion receiving different drug treatments, evaluate pregnancy outcomes, and explore the effects of drug treatments on patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion, providing a good clinical approach for the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent spontaneous abortion. This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from 273 patients who were treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 2020 to June 2023. Patients with a history of two or more unexplained pregnancy losses with the same spouse were included in the recurrent spontaneous abortion group, totaling 173 patients. Based on the different clinical drug treatments, the patients were divided into three groups: non-drug group (30 patients), aspirin group (75 patients), and aspirin combined with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) group (68 patients). A total of 100 patients with no history of pregnancy loss were included in the control group. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 121 (2022)). To reduce the impact of confounding variables, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used: The patients in the RSA group were ① aged 20-39 years; ② had normal ovarian reserve function; ③ had singleton pregnancies; and ④ had a history of two or more pregnancy losses, including biochemical pregnancies, with the same spouse. The control group included ① patients aged 20-39 years, ② patients with normal ovarian reserve function, ③ patients with singleton pregnancy, and ④ patients with no history of pregnancy loss. The exclusion criteria were as follows: ① abnormal uterine anatomy, including uterine malformations, uterine fibroids, endometrial polyps, adenomyosis, intrauterine adhesions, etc.; ② chromosomal abnormalities in either spouse; ③ cervical insufficiency; ④ endocrine abnormalities such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes, etc.; ⑤ uterine cervicitis or endometritis caused by chlamydia, mycoplasma, gonorrhea, fungi, etc.; ⑥ use of vasoactive drugs affecting coagulation function in the past six months; ⑦ internal or surgical complications. Patients’ menstrual history, marital history, reproductive history, history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, past medical history, surgical history, family genetic history, personal history (history of smoking, alcohol abuse, etc.), and history of exposure to harmful environments (chemicals, radiation, etc.) were collected. If the patient has a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes, inquire about the number and timing of adverse pregnancy outcomes, the gestational weeks at termination of pregnancy, the method of termination of pregnancy, and whether the products of conception were sent for genetic testing or chromosomal karyotype analysis. Starting from the month of planned pregnancy, use aspirin (enteric-coated aspirin tablets, Chenxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 50-75 mg orally per day) was used until one week before termination of the pregnancy. Starting from the month of planned pregnancy, aspirin (enteric-coated aspirin tablets, Chenxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 50-75 mg orally per day) was used until one week before termination of pregnancy, and LMWH (enoxaparin, SANOFI WINTHROP INDUSTRIE, subcutaneous injection 0.4 ml (4000 AXaIU) per day) was used until 24 hours before termination of pregnancy. Due to the lack of standardized treatment for this group, all patients were monitored and treated at our reproductive center. These patients did not receive aspirin or LMWH treatment. Therefore, a small number of such patients were included in this study for comparative analysis. The color Doppler ultrasound instrument GE Voluson E8 was used to measure the bilateral uterine artery hemodynamic parameters of the four groups of patients at gestational weeks 30-31 Three to five milliliters of nonanticoagulated venous blood was collected from the elbow vein of pregnant women in the morning on an empty stomach at gestational weeks 30-31 The instructions of the PLGF and sFlt-1 assay kits (purchased from R&D Systems, USA) were followed for operation, with all samples tested in triplicate by the same professional. 
 2.2.1 Before the experiment, the reagents were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. The required microplate strips were removed according to the experimental volume. The remaining strips were sealed with a desiccant in an aluminum foil bag and stored at 4°C. Use them within one week. 2.2.2 Add samples: Set up zero holes, standard holes, and test sample holes. Then, 100 μL of sample dilution buffer was added to the zero wells, and 100 μL of gradient-diluted standard or test sample was added to the remaining wells. The generation of bubbles was avoided (both the standard and sample should be tested in duplicate to minimize experimental errors, ensuring uninterrupted addition of samples, and complete the addition in 5-10 minutes). 2.2.3 Cover the microplate with a cover film and incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. 2.2.4 Wash: The plate film was gently removed (to avoid excessive movement that may cause liquid to spill over into adjacent wells), the liquid was discarded, and the plate was patted dry. The microplate was washed with 350-400 μL of washing solution (1×) per well. After washing, the liquid was shaken off, and the plate was pat-dried. This step was repeated 4 times to prevent foreign matter from entering the wells and the plate from drying out. 
 2.2.5 Add 100 μL of detection antibody (1×) to each well (refer to the reagent preparation section 2.5.2), cover the plate with a film, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour. 2.2.6 Repeat step 2.2.4. 2.2.7 Add 100 μL of HRP-labeled streptavidin (1×) to each well, cover the plate with a film, and incubate at 37°C for 40 minutes. 2.2.8 Repeat step 2.2.4. 2.2.9 Color development: 100 μL of TMB chromogenic solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C in the dark for 15-20 minutes (if the color is too light, the incubation time can be extended appropriately, but not more than 30 minutes; if the color changes, the chromogenic substrate is colorless and transparent before the samples are added). 2.2.10 Termination: 100 μL of stop solution was added to each well, and the blue color was changed to yellow. The order of addition of the termination solution and the TMB chromogenic solution should be consistent (note: avoid contact of the eyes and skin with the termination solution). 2.2.11 Reading: A microplate reader was used to measure the optical density (OD) of each well at 450 nm, with 630 nm as the reference wavelength. The samples were read within 5 minutes after the addition of the stop solution. At no 630 nm wavelength, the 450 nm wavelength can also be used. 2.2.12 Data analysis: The OD value of the zero well was subtracted from each standard and sample well, and the average of duplicate samples was taken. The standard curve was used to calculate the concentration of the samples based on the OD values, which were multiplied by the dilution factor to obtain the actual concentration of the samples. All the data obtained in this study were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 and SPSS 22.0 software. Categorical data are presented as “patients (%)” and were compared using the chi-square test. Normally distributed continuous data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (x±s) and were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the variance was homogeneous, the Bonferroni (B) test was used; when the variance was heterogeneous, Tamhane’s T2 (M) test was applied. Nonnormally distributed continuous data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges) and were analyzed using nonparametric tests. The trend of changes in uterine artery blood flow parameters was fitted using a function, and the fitting process was performed using the curve fitting toolbox in MATLAB R2020b. Missing data were supplemented using the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method in MATLAB R2020b. The diagnostic efficacy of uterine artery blood flow parameters and serum PLGF and sFlt-1 for pregnancy outcomes was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Comparisons of age and BMI among the four groups of patients and comparisons of the number of previous miscarriages among the RSA groups: As shown in Table  Comparison of general characteristics At gestational weeks 30-31 Comparison of uterine artery blood flow parameters The serum levels of PLGF, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1/PLGF in the three groups of RSA patients and the control group were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The results showed heteroscedasticity among the groups. Further comparisons between the groups were conducted using Tamhane’s T2 (M) test. The results showed that the serum PLGF level in the non-drug group was significantly lower than that in the aspirin group, combined drug group, and control group. The serum sFlt-1 and sFlt-1/PLGF levels in the non-drug group were significantly greater than those in the aspirin group, combined drug group, and control group ( Serum PLGF, sFlt-1 and sFlt-1/PLGF levels at 30-31 SPSS 25.0 was used to perform a statistical analysis of the occurrence of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) among the three groups of RSA patients and the control group. The results showed a significant difference in the incidence of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy ( Comparison of pregnancy outcomes among the four groups Using SPSS 25.0, chi-square tests were performed to compare other pregnancy complications among the three RSA groups and the control group. There were no significant differences in the incidence rates of liver function damage, gestational diabetes, premature birth, fetal growth retardation, placenta previa, hypothyroidism, placental abruption, or neonatal asphyxia between the RSA group and the control group ( Using SPSS 25.0, one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare postpartum hemorrhage, gestational age at delivery, newborn length, newborn weight, one-minute Apgar score, and ten-minute Apgar score among the three RSA groups and the control group. There were no significant differences in postpartum hemorrhage, gestational age at delivery, newborn length, newborn weight, one-minute Apgar score, or ten-minute Apgar score among the four groups ( 
 In the aspirin group, the predictive value of PLGF, sFlt-1, and the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) was evaluated. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing HDP was 0.182 for PLGF alone, indicating poor diagnostic performance. For sFlt-1 alone, the AUC was 0.870, indicating good diagnostic performance.

Currently, many theories suggest that endothelial dysfunction and placental ischemia-hypoxia are important factors leading to spontaneous miscarriage in pregnant women [ In the normal process of pregnancy, syncytiotrophoblasts invade the spiral arteries of the uterus early in pregnancy, and syncytiotrophoblasts secrete proangiogenic factors, thereby promoting placental vascular formation and remodeling and facilitating the normal development of the placenta and embryo. In the 1970s, some scholars believed that the impairment of trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling was the cause of uteroplacental circulation defects and subsequent placental ischemia [ The uterine artery is the main blood supply to the uterus and placenta, and uterine artery blood flow parameters can directly reflect blood perfusion in the placenta and embryo. Trophoblast invasion and subsequent remodeling of the uterine spiral arteries are important processes in placental formation during pregnancy [ Clinically, uterine artery blood flow perfusion can be measured by uterine artery blood flow parameters (RI, PI, and S/D). Numerous studies have shown that uterine artery blood flow parameters are significantly greater in patients with recurrent miscarriage than in healthy pregnant women. Studies have shown that both aspirin and LMWH can reduce trophoblast apoptosis. During pregnancy, these agents can reduce uterine artery resistance parameters, significantly improve pregnancy outcomes, and reduce miscarriage rates [ The results of this study revealed changes in uterine artery blood flow parameters between 30 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. There were no significant differences in the data between the aspirin group, combined drug group, and control group, while the non-drug group continued to have higher uterine artery blood flow parameters (including the pulsatility index, resistive index, and peak systolic velocity/end diastolic velocity) than did the other three groups. This may suggest that after 30 weeks of pregnancy, the use of aspirin or aspirin combined with low molecular weight heparin in women with recurrent spontaneous abortion is no different from that in normal pregnant women. However, further research is needed to determine whether discontinuing drug treatment at this time leads to changes in uterine artery blood flow parameters and pregnancy outcomes. On the other hand, in the non-drug group, from before pregnancy to 32 weeks of pregnancy, uterine artery blood flow parameters were all greater than those in normal pregnant women, and there was no change at the 30-week pregnancy mark. This indicates that early and timely treatment is crucial for patients with recurrent miscarriage. There are reports in the literature that the serum level of placental growth factor (PLGF) in nonpregnant patients is extremely low. After pregnancy, the PLGF level slowly begins to rise. In normal pregnant women, the serum PLGF concentration gradually increases with gestational age, peaking at approximately 28-30 weeks of gestation, after which it gradually decreases to 55-65 pg/ml in late pregnancy. This is mainly because PLGF is mainly secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta. In early pregnancy, the placenta is immature, the placental circulation is incomplete, and the placenta is in a hypoxic state, leading to lower PLGF levels. As the placental blood flow circulation improves, the placental vasculature gradually changes from a branching structure to a nonbranching structure, and PLGF regulates the formation of nonbranching blood vessels. When the placenta is most mature, the PLGF also peaks. After 30-32 weeks of gestation, as the placenta matures and begins to age, the PLGF gradually decreases. On the other hand, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) levels do not change significantly in early to mid-pregnancy but gradually increase in late pregnancy. Therefore, the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio is lowest in mid-pregnancy [ This study examined the rates of live birth, miscarriage, and pregnancy complications. The miscarriage rates in patients ranked from highest to lowest were as follows: non-drug group > aspirin group > combined drug group > control group. Subgroup comparison analysis revealed a significant difference in the miscarriage rate between the aspirin group and the combined drug group. This demonstrates that aspirin combined with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can effectively reduce the miscarriage rate in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion, and the effect is superior to that of aspirin alone. This result is consistent with the findings of Peter Clark [ For pregnancy complications, only gestational hypertension and preeclampsia differed among the four groups. The incidence of other pregnancy complications, including liver dysfunction, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placenta previa, hypothyroidism, placental abruption, and neonatal asphyxia, did not significantly differ among the four groups. The incidence of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the nondrug group was greater than that in the other three groups, while there was no significant difference in incidence among the other three groups. This finding is consistent with our findings for mid-pregnancy serum PLGF, sFlt-1, and uterine artery blood flow parameters. Patients with low PLGF, high sFlt-1, and high uterine artery blood flow parameters had a correspondingly increased incidence of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Previous studies by Liu Xiaoning and others have shown that pregnant women with preeclampsia have significantly lower serum PLGF levels than women in the control group in early pregnancy (11-13 In this study, PLGF showed poor predictive efficacy for predicting hypertensive pregnancy disorders, while sFlt-1 demonstrated good predictive value, with the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio showing even better predictive value than sFlt-1 alone. When uterine artery blood flow parameters (mRI, mPI, mS/D) were combined with serum PLGF, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1/PLGF, the predictive value for pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia was significantly improved. Reports in the literature indicate that the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio is a better screening tool than serum PLGF or sFlt-1 alone [ One of the primary limitations of our study is its retrospective nature, which inherently carries the risk of selection bias. Patients were not randomly assigned to treatment groups; instead, treatment decisions were made based on clinical indications, physician judgment, and patient preferences. While this reflects real-world practice, it introduces the possibility that unmeasured confounding factors could influence the observed outcomes. We have taken this into account in our interpretation of the results, and we advise caution in generalizing these findings. Future prospective studies are warranted to further explore and confirm the efficacy of these treatment strategies in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion. The uterine artery blood flow parameters, serum PLGF and sFlt-1 levels, and incidence of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy in the aspirin group and the combined drug group were similar to those in normal pregnant women. In contrast, the nondrug group had significantly greater uterine artery blood flow parameters, serum sFlt-1 levels, and incidence of hypertension, along with significantly lower serum PLGF levels. Uterine artery blood flow parameters, serum PLGF, sFlt-1, and the sFlt-1/PLGF ratio can predict the incidence of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy to a certain extent, with a greater predictive value when these indicators are combined.","['Recurrent spontaneous abortion', 'Uterine artery blood flow parameters', 'PLGF', 'sFlt-1', 'Pregnancy outcomes']",2024-9-28,Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology : RB&E,Gonorrhea
11435973,Evaluating Nanoparticulate Vaccine Formulations for Effective Antigen Presentation and T-Cell Proliferation Using an In Vitro Overlay Assay,"Inducing T lymphocyte (T-cell) activation and proliferation with specificity against a pathogen is crucial in vaccine formulation. Assessing vaccine candidates’ ability to induce T-cell proliferation helps optimize formulation for its safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Our in-house vaccine candidates use microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance antigen stability and target delivery to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), providing improved immunogenicity. Typically, vaccine formulations are screened for safety and immunostimulatory effects using in vitro methods, but extensive animal testing is often required to assess immunogenic responses. We identified the need for a rapid, intermediate screening process to select promising candidates before advancing to expensive and time-consuming in vivo evaluations. In this study, an in vitro overlay assay system was demonstrated as an effective high-throughput preclinical testing method to evaluate the immunogenic properties of early-stage vaccine formulations. The overlay assay’s effectiveness in testing particulate vaccine candidates for immunogenic responses has been evaluated by optimizing the carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) T-cell proliferation assay. DCs were overlaid with T-cells, allowing vaccine-stimulated DCs to present antigens to CFSE-stained T-cells. T-cell proliferation was quantified using flow cytometry on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 upon successful antigen presentation. The assay was tested with nanoparticulate vaccine formulations targeting ","T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses, in conjunction with innate immune responses, contribute to the intricate complexity of the immune system. During the initiation of the immune response, briefly stimulated CD8+ T-cells undergo an atypical rapid succession of extensive cell divisions. Subsequently, they transition into a state of quiescence, giving rise to long-lasting memory cells that establish immunological memory, which retains the capability to re-engage in proliferation upon encountering subsequent immunological stimuli [ Vaccine nanoformulations represent a significant advancement in immunization strategies, leveraging nanoparticles to enhance vaccine delivery, stability, and efficacy [ In developing nanoformulated vaccines, preclinical testing is a critical phase that involves evaluating safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in animal models before progressing to human trials [ In vitro models that mimic the immune system are increasingly utilized as platforms to assess vaccine formulations [ In our efforts to develop an overlay assay for quantifying T-cell responses against vaccine candidates, the CFSE assay was optimized. CFSE, initially a non-fluorescent pro-dye, becomes a highly fluorescent carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester within cells through intracellular esterase activity, detectable via flow cytometry. CFSE fluorescence dilutes evenly among daughter cells as they divide, allowing quantitative assessment of immune cell proliferation in response to the vaccine challenge. In this assay, T-cells from the adaptive immune system are labeled with CFSE, stimulated with activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and incubated for several days to enable clonal expansion. Flow cytometry then quantifies the number of divided cells and daughter cell generations based on CFSE fluorescence levels. Our in-house-formulated vaccine candidates utilize microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver the vaccine antigens efficiently. Here, we assessed the efficiency of our vaccine candidates in promoting T-cell proliferation in response to effective antigen presentation using the CFSE overlay assay and quantified using flow cytometry. The assay was optimized to quantify the T-cell proliferation for six days following antigen presentation. We tested our proof-of-concept particulate vaccine candidates that are formulated against bacterial pathogens  For the preparation of the microparticles, we followed the same protocol as established for the strain CDC F62 and described in our previous manuscripts [ Gonococci vaccine microparticles (Gc-MP) and adjuvant microparticles (Alum and AddaVax™) were synthesized using a protocol similar to a previously established protocol [ Measles vaccine microparticles were prepared and characterized as described in our previous publications [ Zika virus vaccine antigen was cultured, inactivated, and purified using the same method as described in our previously published protocol [ Inactivated influenza A virus vaccine microparticles were formulated using a previously established double emulsion method protocol described in [ Inactivated canine coronavirus (iCCoV) vaccine MPs and Addavax We utilized the Agilent BioTek LionHeart Live Cell Imager to capture the imaging of cell-to-cell contact of the innate and adaptive immune cells in the DC and naïve T-cell overlay models. DCs were plated in a 6-well plate, stimulated with indocyanine green (ICG)-labeled vaccine nanoparticles, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The DCs were observed to be activated and stimulated by the exposure to the BSA NPs, and internalization of the ICG-labeled NPs was evidenced. On the same 6-well plate, we introduced DAPI-stained naïve T-cells, which are non-adherent in nature, and observed the naïve T-cells interacting with the stimulated DCs and imaged the process of antigen presentation to the T-cells. Upon antigen presentation, the T-cells were observed to move away from the interaction, and subsequent T-cell division was imaged as shown below. Dendritic cells (DC 2.0) were adjusted to 0.12 × 10 We utilized an EL4 cell line from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA). The CFSE dye kit was utilized per the company instructions below (details also included in the CellTrace™ CFSE kit, Invitrogen, ref. C34554). Briefly, the vial of lyophilized reagent was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge to ensure that the reagent settled at the bottom of the vial. The stock solution was prepared by reconstituting 1 vial of lyophilized CFSE dye in 36 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to create a 5 mM solution. A 5 µM working solution was then generated by diluting 1 µL of the 5 mM CFSE stock solution in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for every 1 mL of the cell suspension or at an optimal working concentration as determined by titration. The T-cells were spun down and resuspended at 10–100 × 10 The DCs and particles were incubated for 24 h after the vaccine particle addition. After 24 h, the excessive media and particles were removed from the wells by aspirating old media and washing the wells gently with complete DMEM media. To these pulsed DCs, T-cells stained with the CFSE dye as described in  On days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6, T-cells from the designated wells were collected into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes, followed by centrifugation at a speed of 1100 RPM for 7 min at 4 °C temperature. The cell pellet was washed three times with sterile PBS to remove excess dye. After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS, filtered using a 70 µm cell strainer, kept on ice, protected from light, and analyzed using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, San Diego, CA, USA). The live cell population was gated with unstained cells. For each sample, 10,000 events were recorded in the gate for the live lymphocyte population, and cell division in live cells was quantitatively assessed at a 517 nm wavelength. To establish the assay’s versatility, we quantified T-cell proliferation in terms of both mean FITC-A expression-direct comparison of FITC comparison and percent T-cell proliferation-isolating % T-cells proliferated as days progressed by establishing gates along the  We conducted dose-response studies for all antigen-loaded vaccine candidates to assess variations in T-cell proliferation using the overlay assay. The doses of antigen-loaded particles that were tested ranged from 200 µg, 160 µg, 120 µg, 80 µg and 40 µg per well for viral and bacterial vaccine candidates. We conducted this study following the same procedures for all the overlay assays, as explained in  All experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise stated. For statistical analysis, if the data were normally distributed, then ordinary one-way ANOVA or Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were used for independent groups, and two-way ANOVA was used for dependent groups. If the data were not normally distributed, a Kruskal–Wallis test was used. A post-hoc Tukey test was used to compare means, and a post-hoc Dunnett test was used to compare means to the control. Mean values ± SEM and  Upon stimulating the DCs with ICG-coated BSA MPs, the DCs internalized in the MPs in 4 h. The interaction of DAPI-stained naïve T-cells laid over the activated DCs for antigen presentation is shown in  The CFSE-overlay analysis in response to nanoparticulate vaccine candidates at 200 µg per well dose was performed using flow cytometry. Proliferated T-cells or daughter cell populations were quantified based on the percentage of T-cells proliferated from days 0–6 in response to nanoparticulate vaccine candidates pulsed in DCs and subsequent antigen presentation to the T-cells. From the flow cytometry analysis, live T lymphocytes were isolated by applying gating strategies outlined in  The proliferation of daughter T-cells was analyzed across different vaccine treatments and control groups over a span of six days and summarized in  Dose–response studies have been conducted where the proliferation of the T-cells against various doses of the viral and bacterial vaccine candidates was measured. We quantified the T-cell responses that occurred as a result of antigen presentation by the dendritic cells when exposed to several vaccine candidates at concentrations of 200 µg, 160 µg, 120 µg, 80 µg, and 40 µg and monitored on days 1, 2, 4, and 6 that followed. This study revealed significant dose-dependent T-cell proliferation in response to  This study revealed significant dose-dependent T-cell proliferation in response to the Zika,  In this study, the optimized CFSE-stained cell-to-cell contact assay to quantify T-cell proliferation in response to various particulate vaccine candidates when overlaid with the antigen-presenting cells is reported. This in vitro assay has been optimized for multiple variables, including cell density per well, the ratio of APCs to T-cells per well, the number of particles used to pulse APCs in the well, the ratio of the concentration of antigen-loaded vaccine candidates to adjuvant-loaded microparticles, and the number of incubation days needed after antigen presentation to record the optimal T-cell proliferation. The influence of these parameters was examined, and the variations in antigen presentation were recorded with respect to antigen type, carrier variation, and dose variation of the vaccine candidates. In our studies, we tested a 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 ratio of DCs to T cells per well. The 1:1 ratio did not facilitate the antigen presentation as days progressed as much as the 1:5 ratio as we quantified the subsequent T cell proliferation. The 1:10 ratio conducted led to rapid T-cell proliferation; however, we experienced a loss of viable cells due to overcrowding of the cells per well, which could be due to a simple lack of nutrition as the setup could not accommodate the volume of cells. We found that a ratio of 1:5 APCs to T cells led to an optimal exposure of the stimulated DCs to the T-cells for successful antigen presentation while maintaining viable conditions for the CFSE-stained T-cells over the days of analysis. We evaluated the importance of the addition of adjuvants to vaccine candidates in promoting antigen presentation. The effects of Alhydrogel Varied responses within the viral groups of antigens were also observed. The measles vaccine candidate showed the highest initial proliferation and sustained high levels of proliferation throughout the days of analysis. In contrast, vaccine candidates such as Zika showed an initial decrease followed by a substantial increase in T-cell proliferation by day 6, suggesting the potential of Zika vaccine formulation in sustaining antigen presentation over time, particularly at higher concentrations. This observation is critical in understanding the role of pathogen antigen type in producing varying T-cell proliferation responses, a quick initial and sustaining response or a delayed but robust and sustained response over time, and the dose of the vaccine candidates in accomplishing effective antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell proliferation. The overlay assay also provided us with a platform to understand the ability of different carriers to facilitate antigen presentation. Here, we tested a BSA-based microparticulate system and a PLGA-based nanoparticle system as vaccine carriers. Compared to the no particle treatment, the CFSE-stained T-cells only group that showed no proliferation of T-cells past day 2, the blank BSA microparticle and blank PLGA nanoparticle treated groups showed T-cell proliferation throughout the days of analysis. Although blank BSA microparticulate and blank PLGA nanoparticulate groups elicited T-cell proliferation through days 1, 2, and 4, by day 6, there was a significant reduction in proliferation as compared to the vaccine antigen-loaded BSA and PLGA treatment groups. This pattern suggests that while blank particles can initially stimulate T-cell proliferation, the effect diminishes over time, likely due to the lack of specific antigenic stimulation, highlighting the importance of the presence of antigens and adjuvants for enhanced antigen presentation. These variations highlight the vaccine candidates’ differential efficacy and kinetics in inducing T-cell proliferation, emphasizing the potential for selected formulations to elicit stronger and more durable immune responses following optimal antigen presentation. Obtaining this information through this rapid, high-throughput assay prior to testing these formulations in in vivo studies added validation to the formulation and quality control process of vaccine development. Assessing effective antigen presentation using overlay assays has become integral to preclinical testing of vaccine formulations, particularly in early-stage evaluations following initial in vitro assays confirming antigen stability and integrity [ However, further longitudinal studies are required to confirm these findings and understand their long-term implications for a vaccine’s success. Immunological assays such as neutralizing antibody titers and ELISAs, along with functional assays such as virus neutralization and opsonophagocytic assays, provide direct measures of immune effectiveness [ Although overlay assays prove to be highly beneficial in vaccine preclinical development, there are shortcomings in optimizing the assay as it requires sophisticated equipment and technical expertise, given the complexity. Given the fact that in vitro assays cannot replicate the complexity of the in vivo immune environment, including tissue-specific responses and systemic signals, predictive accuracy can be limited in terms of the correlation of outcomes [ Quality control during vaccine formulation development is critical to ensure that vaccines effectively induce the desired immune response while minimizing adverse effects [ A recent deep multi-omics study identified key risk factors for post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) [ In conclusion, we successfully optimized a cell-to-cell contact or T-cell-APC overlay assay to quantify the T-cell proliferation in vitro. We evaluated our in-house formulated particulate vaccine candidates for their ability to stimulate antigen presentation by the APCs, followed by T-cell stimulation and a robust clonal expansion against a specific pathogen. We utilized the CFSE assay to quantify the T-cell daughter populations that were proliferating as a response to the vaccine particle stimulation using flow cytometry. Our data supports this optimized protocol to test microparticulate vaccine formulations containing various bacterial or viral antigens’ ability to induce effective antigen presentation and naive T-cell proliferation. Utilizing this optimized assay, we screen our future vaccine formulations to identify promising vaccine candidates early, ensuring that only the most effective and safe candidates proceed to more resource-intensive animal testing and clinical trials.","['T-cell proliferation', 'overlay assay', 'cell-to-cell contact', 'antigen-presenting cell', 'dendritic cell', 'antigen presentation', 'in vitro vaccine screening', 'CFSE']",2024-9-13,Vaccines,Gonorrhea
11435753,"Bactofection, Bacterial-Mediated Vaccination, and Cancer Therapy: Current Applications and Future Perspectives","From the first report in 1891 by Dr. Coley of the effective treatment of tumors in 1000 patients with Streptococcus and the first successful use of bacterial vectors for transferring therapeutic genes in 1980 by Dr. Schnaffer, bactofection has been shown to be a promising strategy in the fields of vaccination, gene therapy, and cancer therapy. This review describes the general theory of bactofection and its advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and expectations, compiling the most notable advances in 14 vaccination studies, 27 cancer therapy studies, and 13 clinical trials. It also describes the current scope of bactofection and promising results. The extensive knowledge of ","Bactofection is a technique that uses bacteria-mediated transfer of DNA, RNA, or even translated proteins into a wide variety of mammalian cells (phagocytic or no phagocytic) [ The first recorded use of bacterial vectors to transfer genes into a target organism or tissue for therapeutic or research purposes dates to 1980, when Schnaffer tested a recombinant  Live attenuated transformed bacterial strains can be used as vectors to deliver genes cloned into plasmids to eukaryotic cells or tissues. These genes can be expressed to produce a therapeutic product or to induce an immune response against a certain kind of antigen whose origin is infectious or oncogenic ( Overall, bactofection is a promising approach for gene delivery. Its potential applications include gene therapy, vaccine development, and genetic engineering. The basic principle of bactofection relies on three main mechanisms. First, it takes advantage of natural bacterial invasion mechanisms to target specific tissues; this process is mediated by the genes contained in the pathogenicity islands of the bacterial genome itself. Second, it ensures the bacterial vector’s escape from the phagocytic vacuole of the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by including specific virulence factors (e.g., listeriolysin O endotoxin from  A promising benefit of using bacterial vectors to deliver foreign DNA into eukaryotic cells, especially in vaccination or cancer therapy, is their capacity to act as a potent adjuvant, mainly because of their cell wall components (lipopolysaccharide, flagellin, peptidoglycan, teichoic acids, porins, mycolic acid, and mannose-rich glycans) that by their nature as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induce the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, triggering potent activation, and consequently, leading to more efficient adaptive immune responses against the vector-encoded heterologous antigen. An excellent illustration of this was the proof that a bacterial-based oral vaccine platform can achieve long-lasting mucosal immunity, eliciting adequate B and T cell memory responses with long-lasting conferred immunity and producing fewer side effects than other vaccination platforms [ Likewise, bactofection has been quite effective for tumor treatment. In a study using live attenuated  Vaccination or cancer therapy is not the only goal that can be accomplished with bactofection; bacterial vectors can also be used to deliver eukaryotic expression plasmids to introduce relevant transgenes into somatic tissues to treat or prevent diseases that result from genetic disorders. Of note are the experiments of Krusch and colleagues, who used a transformed and partially attenuated (reduced toxigenic activity of hemolysin)  However, among all of the benefits of using bactofection, the risk of infection due to the reversion of virulence in attenuated strains is still a possibility that needs to be addressed. Moreover, the induction of undesirable immune responses is also a possibility that requires careful consideration. Diverse mechanisms have been implemented to mitigate these unwanted risks, such as random chemical mutagenesis (e.g., nitrosoguanidine) to introduce attenuating mutations in several vital genes. These mutations can affect enzymes of crucial metabolic pathways causing auxotrophy, downregulate the surface antigens synthesis to avoid clearance by the immune system of the host, disable the sigma factor of the stress response, and cause the complete inactivation of virulence factors with specific attention to superantigens. The simultaneous attenuation of several genes of vital metabolic pathways may reduce the probability of a reversion to virulence. The use of suicide genes is another commonly used method to reduce the risks associated with bacterial vectors [ Suicide genes are genetic elements designed to cause bacterial self-destruction after they have delivered their cargo. One approach that has been used involves the introduction of a gene called LyE ( Bacterial-mediated gene transfer for vaccination purposes possesses unique properties that confer advantages over traditional platforms, such as tissue tropism, cell-to-cell spread, virulence factors that mediate the delivery of the codified antigen to inaccessible tissue layers, mediation of the transfer of large genomic fragments, the ability of the vector to act as a potent adjuvant enhancing the immune response against the encoded antigen, and lower costs of production [ The percentage of use of each type of strain for vaccination is illustrated in  The advantages mentioned above are of particular interest in therapy against diverse infectious diseases, as in the case of designing effective vaccine candidates against HIV, in which Karpenko and colleagues tested in mice an orally administered  Vaccination based on virus-like particles (VLPs), despite being safe and immunogenic, presents serious difficulties in their production and is not completely effective in inducing a consistent immune response. In this sense, bacterial vectors may be helpful to synthesize and secrete the required antigenic proteins that will later self-assemble to form functional VLPs. Another important benefit of using bacterial vectors is their inherent capacity to act as a potent adjuvant that may potentiate the mucosal immune response. This hypothesis was proven by Li and colleagues, who demonstrated in a murine study that the  In the attempt to control infectious diseases, the most commonly employed strain in bacterial-based vaccination is  Regarding other efforts to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on the  The intramuscular administration of the multicistronic experimental vaccine in mice induced a strong cellular response measured by peptide-specific CD4+ and CD8+ activation and significant changes in the cytokine expression profile of IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10, as well as a robust IgG1 and IgG2a antibody response against RBD, HR, M and nsp13 antigens. Notably, the production of NAbs against HR was significantly more predominant than the rest of the antigens ( In another attempt to generate an effective  Mentioning other immunization efforts through bactofection to control chronic infectious diseases, the  The world’s deadliest bacterial infection is tuberculosis (TB), whose etiological agent is  The only licensed vaccine for TB is bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG), which protects against extrapulmonary TB but not against pulmonary TB. BCG was genetically modified at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology to improve its immunogenicity by producing VPM1002. This recombinant BCG-∆ureC::hly live attenuated vaccine candidate has the urease C gene ( Attenuated strains of  Shigellosis remains a major public health problem around the world, causing 212,000 deaths per year. Currently, no licensed vaccines for this disease are widely available, but several vaccine candidates are in development [ A main concern of bactofection as a vaccination platform is the possible impact of preexisting immunity to the employed bacterial vectors due to previous infections or previous vaccinations that could severely affect the immunogenicity of first-time vaccination or boosts that try to augment the immune response. In this context, Metzger and colleagues evaluated the effect on the immune response of a first-time immunization (complete vaccination scheme) with a non-recombinant Ty21a vaccine in 13 volunteers, followed by subsequent administration of a recombinant Ty21a expressing subunits A and B of  In accordance with this, two independent studies showed that previous priming with a  Major studies should be conducted in endemic zones with a high prevalence of certain diseases to evaluate if priming with a related bacterial strain may deteriorate the immune response to a codified heterologous antigen in the same strain. In an attempt to prove this, a trial was assessed in Indonesia (endemic zone of intense prevalence of typhoid fever) in 23,543 individuals, with the objective of analyzing the efficacy of the complete vaccination scheme of Ty21a to prevent typhoid fever. A 30-month follow-up was carried out, detecting just a 53% level of protection against the disease ( According to these results, prior priming with the vector may result in the inefficient induction of immunity against codified antigens. To overcome this issue, different serotypes or strains may be used [ Transformed auxotrophic mutants harboring the LLO gene can escape from phagosomes into the cytosol of macrophages and deliver their antigen-encoded eucaryotic expression plasmids after being lysed because of their attenuation [ Other mechanisms of phagosomal escape have been successfully employed in bactofection as the IpaC–IpaB translocon at the tip of the T3SS of  The efficiency of plasmid expression without a phagosomal escape gene has been evaluated in vitro in two attenuated CD12 and WT05  It should be noted that there are important differences in the experimental models of these two approaches, like the kind of cell line used (J774.2 vs. primary peritoneal macrophages), or the kind of bacterial strain employed (CD12, WT05, and SL7207). In the different conditions the reporter gene expression was as follows J774.2/WT05 98.16%, J774.2/CD12 74.12%, and J774.2/SL7207 94.54%; primary macrophages/WT05 64%; primary macrophages/CD12 32%; primary macrophages/SL7207 28%. These results lead us to consider that both the cell type used as the model and the chosen bacterial strains can generate important variations in the in vitro approaches; therefore, in vivo studies are essential to diminish biases [ The first report of treating cancer with bacteria goes back to 1891, when William B. Coley injected  Van Pijkeren and colleagues demonstrated for the first time that an attenuated (by increased sensitivity to ampicillin)  Several authors have reported success in reducing the volume of solid tumors and increased survival in mice by infecting them with bacteria, especially when using the  One additional approach to antitumor therapy using bacterial vectors is gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT). This method involves delivering a gene-coding enzyme to specific cells, which then controls the conversion of prodrugs into drugs. This process increases toxicity and induces apoptosis in the target cells [ Following this strategy, a study aimed to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of orally administrated  The most common bacterial vector used in cancer therapy is  Other strains used as bacterial vectors for cancer therapy are  One of the main antitumor mechanisms of bacterial-based therapy is the induction of cytotoxicity by the bacterial vector, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and triggering tumor cell death by apoptosis or pyroptosis. In addition, the detection of bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by immune cells induces cytokine release and recruitment of leukocytes, which initiate an anti-tumor immune response. Moreover, the transfer of antigens from the bacteria to the cancer cell enables the adaptive immune system to recognize the cancer cell as infected and a bearer of exogenous antigens [ Bacterial internalization and intra-cellular replication inside cancer cells are mediated mostly by Type III secretion systems (TTSS). Using this type of secretion system,  The use of antitumoral bacterial therapy in tumor-associated macrophages is particularly interesting because it can trigger pyroptosis, a type of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. This leads to the activation of caspase 1, which in turn activates the inflammasome, triggers the secretion of IL-1B and IL-18, causes changes in cell shape, reorganizes the cytoskeleton and nucleus, and ultimately leads to the rupture of the cell membrane. This results in the release of inflammatory signals that boost the body’s immune response against tumors. This quick cell death of macrophages leads to the liberation of bacteria that can infect surrounding cancer cells. Malignant cells that survive infection may degrade bacterial proteins (by proteasomal degradation) and present foreign peptides through MHC I to cytotoxic lymphocytes, which in turn induce tumor cell death, consequently leading to a rapid decrease in tumor volume [ Another added benefit of treating tumoral tissues with  In a more recent study, Chen and colleagues, developed a recombinant model of  Bacterial-based antitumoral therapy has multiple functionalities. In an interesting approach, Siddiqui and colleagues developed a system in which a tumor colonized with  In a more conventional approach, a recombinant  Only 13 studies in Phase I and just two in Phase II have been carried out to date to treat cancer patients with bacterial vectors ( Schmitz-Winnenthal et al. developed the first orally applied tumor vaccine candidate, VXM01. They used a live attenuated  In another trial, assessing the efficacy of tumor regression by the intravenous administration of an attenuated  Other strategies, such as converting prodrugs into chemotherapeutic drugs at specific sites of tumor proliferation, have been explored. This strategy aimed to avoid the characteristic systemic collateral damage of these drugs. The  Bacterial ghosts (BGs) are fully inactivated bacteria composed of bacterial shells with pores, with a partial or complete release of their cellular components. If an appropriate inactivation method is used, the structural integrity of the surface antigens can remain intact [ Gram-negative bacterial inactivation mediated by the inducible expression of the lysis E protein (LyE) from phage ΦX174 is the most effective non-denaturing method employed. This approach allows for the maintenance of the structural integrity of the cell wall antigens, which could potentiate the immune response in favor of the codified antigens. LyE works mainly by two mechanisms. Firstly, it directly inhibits the phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY) enzyme, which catalyzes the cell wall peptidoglycan layer [ After at least three washes with PBS, the empty inner space of BGs can be filled with nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes, drugs, or other desired compounds ( BGs can carry more nucleic acids than living bacteria, which makes them ideal as vectors in gene therapy. Their excellent loading capacity with pDNA or dsDNA (up to 6000 medium-sized plasmid copies per BG) is due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged DNA molecules and the positively charged moieties (amine groups) present on the nonpolarized internal membrane [ Several other methods of binding DNA to the inner membrane of the BGs have been described [ Several studies in different animal models sought to determine the appropriate dose and route of administration of BGs delivering recombinant DNA encoding antigens of interest to achieve an effective immune response [ In an approach to determine the expression level of a foreign gene in immune human cells mediated by BG therapy, non-mature human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were treated with BGs ( The effectiveness of immune response induction mediated by BGs harboring antigenic genes depends on several factors such as dose, route of administration, and inherent characteristics of the antigenic gene construct. In a murine study comparing the intramuscular vaccine efficiency of naked DNA vs. BG ( Intramuscular, oral, mucosal, intradermal, and peritoneal administration of BG-based DNA vaccination, even with a single dose, demonstrated the same relative long-lasting efficacy, within 12 days after immunization, as well as a preference for the Th1 response, with some exceptions [ The current trend in vaccination is the use of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that encapsulate nucleic acids (e.g., BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) [ To evaluate the effectiveness of BGs as DNA delivery vectors in cancer therapy, the capacity of  Effective gene delivery requires relatively low DNA concentrations to produce expression in target cells, allowing BGs to be loaded with multiple plasmids and be used to deliver heterologous genes [ The use of attenuated or inactivated recombinant bacterial vectors to deliver therapeutic or immunogenic genes in cancer gene therapy and vaccination has shown many advantages, but important aspects continue to be unknown. Therefore, many areas remain unexplored, such as finding specific attenuations that confer the most suitable characteristics for invading tumor tissues, the most appropriate strains with specific pathogenicity islands to invade difficult-to-reach tumor regions, target acidic and hypoxic environment characteristics of the tumor microenvironment, and select the most appropriate virulence factors that confer tropism for specific cell types or tissues. Exploring novel phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the vectors and possible variations of the encoded therapeutic genes are required to assess if the effectiveness of already established models can be enhanced. Additionally, comparative studies comparing the efficiency between live and inactivated bacteria harboring therapeutic genes are required, as both models confer appropriate immunity levels against the encoded antigen. Something important to note is that of the 27 studies referenced in this review focused on cancer therapy based on bactofection ( Since there are already highly effective approved vaccines based on live attenuated bacteria such as Ty21a (approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), manufactured by Berna Biotech, Bern, Swiss; PaxVax, San Diego, US; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France; Biopharma, Lima, Perú), which can be used as a platform for future vaccines or cancer therapy [","['bactofection', 'bacterial based vaccination', 'bacterial cancer', 'gene therapy']",2024-8-27,Vaccines,Gonorrhea
11435550,Evaluation of Totarol for Promoting Open Wound Healing in Dogs,"Standard wound management involving topical antibiotics or essential oils can enhance the healing process. Organic plant oil extracts, such as totarol, have demonstrated efficacy in wound healing as adjunctive treatments. This study focuses on evaluating the antibacterial properties of totarol and its efficacy in clinical wound healing in dogs. This result reveals that totarol exhibited antimicrobial activity against both standard pathogens and clinical wound pathogens. Clinically, the use of totarol as an adjunctive therapy significantly improved wound healing, as indicated by a greater percentage of wound area reduction. This study investigates the susceptibility of common pathogens to totarol and assesses its clinical effectiveness in promoting wound healing in client-owned dogs with open wounds. Twenty-three client-owned dogs with open wounds were divided into two groups: (1) the treatment group (T-group) and (2) the control group (C-group). Clinical samples were collected from the wounds for the bacterial identification and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of totarol. In the T-group, wounds were treated with standard wound care together with the application at a dosage of 0.3 mL (two sprays) of commercial totarol product per 25 cm","Open wounds are injuries that disrupt the continuity of skin and expose internal tissues. Common types of open wounds in dogs include traumatic wounds from vehicles, bite wounds, lacerations from sharp objects, gun shots, and incised wounds [ The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a significant threat to both health care and veterinary practice. The extensive and inappropriate use of antimicrobials has led to the rise of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, posing treatment problems in clinical practice. Several studies have shown that the active ingredients in plant extracts possess antimicrobial activity and promote wound healing through various mechanisms. For instance,  This study aims to assess the in vitro susceptibility of common bacteria found in clinical open wounds to totarol. Additionally, it aims to clinically evaluate the wound healing effects of standard wound care together with the use of commercial totarol products compared with standard wound care alone in client-owned dogs with open wounds. Study design: This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of standard wound care alone versus totarol adjunct to standard wound care for healing open wounds in dogs. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Khon Kaen University (IACUC-KKU 50/66). Owners were informed about the study protocol, consented to their dogs’ participation, received subsidized treatment costs, and signed the consent forms before the study commenced. Selected cases were allocated to either in-patient or out-patient wound management. Dogs were randomly assigned to the control group (C-group) or the treatment group (T-group) using Microsoft Excel. The owners and the data analyst were blinded for the group allocations. Samples: The study was conducted between May 2023 and February 2024 at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Khon Kaen University (VTH-KKU). The VTH-KKU offers services for small animals, exotic animals, and large animals while also serving as a teaching facility for veterinary students in clinical practice. The VTH-KKU employs over 40 veterinarians and 60 support staff, managing approximately 120–150 outpatient cases per day. The cases for inclusion in the study were selected from the client-owned dogs presenting at the VTH-KKU with open wounds of at least 1 cm Bacterial culture and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination: The MICs determination protocol involved collecting wound samples from clinical cases at the VTH-KKU between May 2023 and February 2024. Upon collection, wound samples underwent bacterial isolation, using blood agar and MacConkey agar plates. Bacterial strains were then identified utilizing the Vitek2 system ( A 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension was prepared and adjusted to a final concentration of 5 × 10 To verify the MIC methods and evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the absolute ethyl alcohol, three biological replicates were conducted using two standard pathogens:  Treatment: All dogs received a standardized medical treatment, which included an intravenous administration of empirical antibiotics such as cefazolin 20–25 mg/kg q8h (CEFABEN Wound healing measurements: The wound healing assessment utilized a combination of digital imaging and image analysis, widely regarded as the most accurate and reliable methods for wound area measurement in clinical practice [ W Wx = area on measurement day. Data analysis: The MIC values were reported as a description of the totarol assessed against standard pathogens and clinical wound pathogens. General information of the subjects, including patient age, wound age, and initial wound area, was compared between the C-group and the T-group by independent T-tests. An evaluation of the average wound area reduction in the clinical cases, including both the C-group and the T-group, was statistically analyzed using the repeated linear mixed model. The full model included fixed effects, such as the treatment protocol, and the day in the healing evaluation, along with their interaction effect. A random intercept was included to accommodate within-dog variability, and a random slope on the repeated day for the healing evaluation was assigned with an unstructured covariance structure. The simple effect comparison between groups at each time point was tested by post-estimation analysis (CONTRAST command). Significance was determined at a  The antimicrobial effects of absolute ethyl alcohol greater than 60-fold did not exhibit antimicrobial properties in the MIC results. The MIC results of two standard pathogens were consistent across three replicates, as shown in  The in vitro study revealed that totarol exhibited an antimicrobial activity against clinical wound pathogens ( There was no significant difference in wound age between the T-group and C-group ( Our study demonstrates the positive antimicrobial activity of totarol against wound pathogens. This finding is supported by existing articles that highlight the antibacterial properties of totarol in medical products [ The C-group comprised the control group/the standard wound-care-alone group, while the T-group comprised totarol supplementing the standard wound care.  Our clinical study data demonstrate the effectiveness of totarol as an adjunct to standard wound care in enhancing the wound healing process. Our findings indicated a significant increase in the rate of wound area reduction when totarol was added to standard wound care compared to standard wound care alone, starting from day 2 of treatment ( The small sample size in this study may have contributed to the unequalness of the initial wound sizes. The variable wound model of the clinical cases, which encompasses factors such as wound cause, wound age, and wound shape, may have influenced the wound healing process. Although efforts were made to adjust the initial wound area sizes to equalize wound areas before comparison in the data analysis, the inherent variability in the clinical cases could have impacted the study’s outcomes. Further studies could focus on exploring the clinical use of totarol in treating small animal skin diseases, including superficial dermatitis, deep pyoderma, or otitis externa. Investigating the efficacy and safety of totarol in these conditions would provide a valuable insight into its potential applications in veterinary practice and contribute to the existing body of knowledge on alternative therapeutic approaches. The current study demonstrated that totarol exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against clinical wound pathogens in dogs. Additionally, our clinical trial provides evidence that the topical application of totarol enhances wound healing by accelerating the rate of wound area reduction. These findings suggest that totarol could serve as a promising adjunct to standard wound care for the treatment of open wounds in dogs.","['adjunctive treatment', 'totarol', 'veterinary', 'wound care']",2024-9-16,Veterinary Sciences,Gonorrhea
11435363,Novel Therapeutic Effects of ,Natural products with high antioxidant activity are considered as innovative prevention strategies to effectively prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the early stage because the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to the development of drusen is reported as an important cause of this disease. To investigate the prevention effects of the methanol extracts of ,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an important cause of the severe loss of central vision in older adults. AMD is characterized by the deposition of drusen and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities (non-neovascular derangement, dry AMD) and choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) formation (neovascular derangement, wet AMD) [ Meanwhile, few standard therapeutic strategies have been proposed to slow the progression of AMD in its final stages, and no ideal preventive treatment is currently available [ In this study, the protective effects of the methanol extracts of  First, we identified the bioactive compounds in the MEE to predict which compounds were associated with the therapeutic effects of the MEE in AMD treatment. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analyses detected 10 bioactive compounds in the MEE. Among these, oleamide was present in the highest relative content, followed by linoleamide, palmitoleamide, quercetin, quercetrin, kaempferol, and ellagic acid ( To predict the potential utility of the MEE as a therapeutic drug for AMD, the antioxidative activity of the MEE was evaluated against three free radicals, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and nitric oxide (NO). The MEE showed high inhibitory activity against these three free radicals in a significant dose-dependent manner. These levels were remarkably increased at 1–1000 µg/mL of the MEE, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC To examine whether the MEE pretreatment could suppress the oxidative stress that leads to AMD, the alterations in the production of intracellular ROS and NO were measured in A2E + BL-exposed ARPE-19 cells after the MEE pretreatment. A significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-stained cells representing intracellular ROS was detected in the three MEE + A2E + BL-treated groups when compared with the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group. The highest decrease at 88.2% was observed in the HMEE + A2E + BL-treated group ( To investigate whether the suppressive effects of MEE on oxidative stress accompany an improvement in antioxidative capacity, the alterations in the phosphorylation of nuclear factors erythroid 2-related factors (Nrf2) and the activity and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were examined in A2E + BL-exposed ARPE-19 cells after the MEE pretreatment. The level of phosphorylation of Nrf2 was lower in the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group than in the control group. However, this level was significantly increased with dose-dependent pattern in the three MEE + A2E + BL-treated groups compared to the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group ( To investigate the effects of the MEE in lowering the inflammatory responses caused by the A2E + BL exposure, alterations in the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mediated pathway, inflammasome pathway, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in the A2E + BL-exposed ARPE-19 cells after the MEE pretreatment. The expression levels of the iNOS and COX-2 was significantly enhanced in the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group compared to the No group. However, these levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the three MEE-treated groups, although the decrease in the expression of COX-2 protein was greater than that of the iNOS protein ( To investigate the suppressive effects of MEE on the cell death caused by the A2E + BL exposure, the alterations in cell viability, apoptotic cell population, and expression of apoptotic proteins were analyzed in the A2E + BL-exposed ARPE-19 cells after the MEE pretreatment. The cell viability was significantly enhanced in the three MEE + A2E + BL-treated groups although these levels were remarkably lower in the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group than in the control group. Also, the morphology of the ARPE-19 cells was well reflected at the levels of cell viability ( Next, we analyzed the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and VEGF proteins in the MEE + A2E + BL-treated ARPE-19 cells to examine the improvement in the dysregulation of angiogenesis caused by the A2E + BL exposure by the MEE. The expression levels of the three proteins, including MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF, were higher in the Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group than in the control group. But, these expression levels were significantly declined after the MEE pretreatment at different doses. Especially, only MMP-9 proteins showed a dose-dependent response in the three MEE + A2E + BL-treated groups ( Finally, we verified the therapeutic effects of MEE treatment seen in the A2E + BL-exposed ARPE-19 cells using an animal model. To achieve this, the alterations in the thickness of the whole retina, outer segment (OS), outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) were analyzed in BL-exposed BALB/c mice after the MEE pretreatment. The thickness of the whole retina was significantly enhanced in the LMEE + BL- and HMEE + BL-treated groups compared with the Vehicle + BL-treated group, although they were lower in the Vehicle + BL-treated group than in the non-treated group ( Furthermore, we investigated whether the improvement in the regulation of retina thickness seen with the MEE treatment has an association with the alteration of the inflammatory response. To achieve this, the alteration in the expression of key parameters of the iNOS and COX-2 proteins was measured in the retinal tissues of the BL-exposed BALB/c mice. As shown in  AMD is a complex, progressive, and multifactorial disease affecting the retinas of older people [ We selected a novel candidate,  During the pathogenesis of AMD, A2E produced from photoreceptor cells accumulates in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the retina and gradually transfers into oxidized forms (A2E-ox and A2E-2ox) on exposure to BL [ Until now, animal models based on the histological characteristics of AMD have been created in several animal species including mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, and non-human primates, although there is no model yet that has all the phenotypes of human AMD [ The lyophilized sample of the MEE (FBM 223-005) was provided by the International Biological Material Research Center (IBMRC) of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB, Daejeon, Republic of Korea). First, the MEE was collected from a mixture of ground dried powder of  The bioactive compounds in the MEE were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), as described in previous studies [ The scavenging activity of MEE for the DPPH and ABTS radicals was measured using a previously described method [ To analyze the ABTS radical scavenging activity, eleven different dosages of the MEE (1 to 1000 μg/mL, 25 μL) were mixed with the ABTS working solution (250 μL), and they were reacted at room temperature for 4 min. Finally, their absorbance was measured at 734 nm in an ultraviolet (UV)-visible (UV–VIS) spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The resultant data for the ABTS radical scavenging activity has been presented as ascorbic acid equivalent (A5960, Sigma-Aldrich Co.), which was used as a standard. To measure the NO radicals scavenging activity, a total 100 µL of MEE solution with varying concentrations of the MEE (1 to 1000 µg/mL) was mixed with 400 µL of 10 mM sodium nitroprusside, and their reaction was induced at room temperature for 2.5 h. Then, this mixture was mixed with Griess reagent (200 µL) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the absorbance of reaction mixture was analyzed at 540 nm using a VersaMax The scavenging activity of MEE against DPPH, ABTS, and NO radicals was represented as the IC A2E for the induction of AMD into ARPE-19 cells was prepared, as described in a previous study [ ARPE-19 cells, derived from the normal eyes of a 19-year-old male, were provided from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in a 5% CO The optimal concentrations of the MEE as well as A2E at specific BL irradiation levels were determined as described in a previous study [ To examine the protective effects of MEE on the AMD, induced by BL in A2E-laden ARPE-19 cells, the cells were briefly classified into two groups: No group (non-treated group) and the A2E + BL-treated group. The latter group was further divided into the four groups: Vehicle (DMSO)-treated group (Vehicle + A2E + BL-treated group), low-dose (50 μg/mL) MEE-treated group (LMEE + A2E + BL-treated group), medium-dose (100 μg/mL) MEE-treated group (MMEE + A2E + BL-treated group) and high-dose (200 μg/mL) MEE-treated group (HMEE + A2E + BL-treated group). ARPE-19 cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence and pretreated with 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL of the MEE or DMSO of the same volume to have a final concentration of 1% for 24 h. The cells of each group were further treated with 20 μM of A2E for 24 h. Then, the MEE and A2E-treated cells were irradiated by BL (430 nm, 6000 lux) for 10 min. The viability of the cells was measured by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described in previous studies after incubation for 24 h [ The distribution of the apoptotic cell population was analyzed using a Muse The intracellular ROS levels were measured by observing the ARPE-19 cells stained with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; D6883, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) under a fluorescent microscope, as described in a previous study [ The NO concentration and the level of nitrite in the ARPE-19 cells were analyzed using the Griess reagent (G7921, Invitrogen Co, Waltham, MA, USA), as outlined in a previous study [ The SOD activity in MEE + A2E + BL-treated ARPE-19 cells was determined using a SOD assay kit (S311, Dojindo Molecular Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and previous study [ The total cellular proteins were obtained from the ARPE-19 cells of subset groups using the Pro-Prep Protein Extraction Solution (17081, Intron Biotechnology Inc., Seongnam, Republic of Korea), based on the manufacturer’s protocol [ The total RNA was purified from the ARPE-19 cells of the subset groups using TRIzol reagent (FATRR001, Favorgen Biotech, Ping-Tung, Taiwan), based on the manufacturer’s protocol [ The Pusan National University (PNU)–Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviewed and approved the protocol for the AMD animal model study (Approval no. PNU-2022-0249). All mice were housed at the PNU-Laboratory Animal Resources Center (LARC) accredited by the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) (unit 000231) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International) (unit 001525). Male BALB/c mice (7 weeks old) originated from Taconic Co. (Germantwon, NY, USA) and were purchased from the Samtako BioKorea Co., Ltd. (Osan, Republic of Korea). The mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions (SPF) (50 ± 10% of relative humidity and 23 ± 2 °C of temperature) under a strict light/dark cycle. Briefly, the 7-week-old BALB/c mice (thirty males with an average weight of 20.29 g) were assigned to either a non-irradiated group (non-treated group,  After collection of the eye tissues from the BL-exposed BALB/c mice, these tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde (pH 6.8), dehydrated in an alcohol dilution series (70 to 100%), and embedded in paraffin wax. The tissues were cut into sections of 4 µm thickness, and subsequently deparaffinized and rehydrated using xylene solution (8587-4410, DaeJung Chemicals, Siheung, Republic of Korea) and an alcohol dilution series (100 to 70%). After removing the residues with distilled water, the eye tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and the histopathological changes in eye tissues were analyzed using the Leica Application Suite (LAS, Leica Microsystems). The thickness of the whole retina, OS, the ONL, INL, and IPL of the mounted eye tissue were measured using the Leica Application Suite (Leica Microsystems, Switzerland). Considering the surface irregularities of each layer, three different points including thickest point, thinnest point, and medium thickness point were measured and presented as their mean values. The tissue distribution of the COX-2, and iNOS proteins was detected using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining analysis as described in a previous study [ Briefly, the normality of distribution of all data were checked by K-S test. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS release 10.10 for Windows (IBM SPSS, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The significance of the intergroup differences was determined by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Results are presented as means ± SDs, and statistical significance was accepted for  In the present study, we attempted to identify novel natural products with a high potential for AMD treatment using an in vitro and in vivo model. To achieve this, the MEE was selected based on its antioxidant activity, and the antioxidant defense mechanism, anti-apoptosis pathway, anti-angiogenesis effects, and anti-inflammatory response of the MEE were analyzed in A2E-laden ARPE-19 cells after exposure to BL; the retinas of BL-exposed BALB/c mice were also analyzed. The suppression of intracellular oxidative stress and activation of antioxidant defense mechanism were detected in A2E + BL-treated ARPE-19 cells. Also, the MEE treatment inhibited the inflammatory response, apoptosis activation, and upregulation of neovascular protein induced by A2E + BL treatment. Furthermore, significant enhancement effects of MEE on the retinal thickness were detected in BALB/c mice with BL-induced retinal degeneration. Therefore, these results suggest that the MEE, with its high antioxidative activity, protects against BL-induced retinal degeneration through the regulation of the antioxidative system, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and neo-vascularization in the AMD mouse model.","['age-related macular degeneration', 'retina', 'oxidative stress', 'BALB/c mice']",2024-9-10,Pharmaceuticals,Gonorrhea

In the present study, faecal samples of ruddy shelducks collected from Saga County, Shigatse City, Tibet, China, were subjected to viral metagenomic analysis. The predominant viral families identified in ruddy shelduck samples were ","The ruddy shelduck ( The viral metagenomics approach serves as a potent technique for exploring both new and recognized viruses, and it is widely used to analyze the viral composition across a variety of samples [ A total of 10 faecal samples from 10 healthy ruddy shelducks were collected in December 2020 from Saga County, Shigatse City, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Disinfect cotton swabs were used to obtain faecal samples, which were stored in sterile tubes and cold chain transportation to the laboratory. Each fecal sample was mixed with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vigorously vortexed for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant from each sample was then transferred to a new 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and stored at −80 °C for the following study. A combined supernatant sample pool containing ten faecal supernatants was generated. A total of 500 μl faecal suspension (50 μl faecal suspension per faecal sample) was mixed and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min to eliminate bacteria and particles of eukaryotic cell size. Subsequently, the virus-rich filtrates were treated at 37 °C for 90 min with a mixed nuclease cocktail (Turbo DNase from Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, BaselineZero DNase from Epicentre, USA, Benzoase nuclease from Novagen Corporation, USA, and RNase A from Thermo Fisher Scientific) to degrade unprotected nucleic acid [ The cDNA of viruses were synthesized by reverse transcription procedure using random hexamer primers. Complementary chains of cDNA were synthesized using Klenow fragment DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Subsequently, a library was constructed using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), followed by sequencing on the NovaSeq Illumina platform with paired-end reads of 250 bp and dual barcoding for each pool. For bioinformatics analysis, 250-bp paired-end reads generated by NovaSeq were debarcoded using vendor software, which was processed using an in-house analysis pipeline running on a 32-node Linux cluster. Low-quality sequenced tails were trimmed using a Phred quality score of 10 as the threshold. Adapter sequences were removed utilising the default VecScreen settings. Bowtie2 v2.2.4 was employed to align bacterial reads against the bacterial nucleotide sequences in the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) NT database, effectively subtracting bacterial contamination from the dataset.

This study is aimed at exploring the different clinical manifestations of both pneumonias to establish a simple nomogram to distinguish them. This multicenter, retrospective, case–control study compared two independent cohorts of patients with CPP or COVID-19. The risk factors of CPP were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression, which was used to establish the nomogram. Both patients with CPP and COVID-19 exhibited similar clinical symptoms. As compared to patients with COVID-19, a higher proportion of patients with CPP had nervous system symptoms. Patients with CPP had higher inflammatory indicators, creatine kinase, and lower lymphocyte and albumin. They also had lower proportions of ground-glass opacity and bilateral lung involvement than COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, patients with CPP had higher 30 day mortality as well as higher rates of severe pneumonia, septic shock, and ICU admission. Multivariate logistic regression showed that nervous system symptoms, lymphocytes, creatine kinase, bilateral lung lesions, and ground-glass opacity were risk factors for CPP. Incorporating these five factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance index of 0.989 in differentiating CPP from COVID-19, and had well-fitted calibration curves. Despite similar clinical characteristics, nervous system symptoms, lymphocyte, creatine kinase, lesions in bilateral lungs, and ground-glass opacity may help in differentiating the pneumonias. These were combined into a clinically useful nomogram for rapid and early identification of CPP to avoid misdiagnosis and help in the decision-making process.","Human psittacosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci), and mainly develops due to inhalation of contaminated aerosols from respiratory or eye secretions, dry feces, and urine of infected birds or asymptomatic carriers COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and has spread worldwide, which has posed a serious threat to global public health. In addition, the emergence of mutant strains, such as Delta and Omicron, which are more transmissible than previous strains and may reduce the effectiveness of vaccination, are concerning Although CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia show similar clinical symptoms and laboratory characteristics, there are no large-sample clinical studies comparing the clinical features of the two types of pneumonia. Furthermore, the treatment and prognosis of CPP and COVID-19 are different; therefore, accurate diagnosis according to different clinical manifestations is imperative. In this study, we aimed to explore the different clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia to establish a simple nomogram for differentiating CPP from COVID-19 in order to guide diagnosis in clinical practice. This was a retrospective case–control study. All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were hospitalized at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology between January 29, 2020, and April 8, 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the WHO Interim Guidelines. All the patients with COVID-19 by positive Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 from nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The patients with CPP were hospitalized in 10 tertiary general hospitals in Central-South China between June 21, 2018, and June 6, 2022. CPP was diagnosed on the basis of positive results of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of respiratory or blood samples, combined with clinical presentation. According to previous studies The methods and steps of mNGS detection are based on our previous research Flow diagram of the study population. Baseline clinical features, laboratory test results, and imaging data of each patient were extracted from the electronic medical systems. A team of experienced respiratory clinicians independently collected, reviewed, and analyzed clinical data. The baseline characteristics of the patients included demographic characteristics (age and sex), underlying diseases, clinical symptoms and signs, and disease severity scores (CURB-65 and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]). Treatment data included respiratory support mode, life support technology, and drug therapy. Laboratory data included routine blood tests, blood biochemistry, liver and kidney function, myocardial injury mediators, inflammatory mediators, blood coagulation, and procalcitonin levels. Two senior radiologists reviewed the radiological images of lung lesions, including the location and characteristics of the lesions. All baseline laboratory and imaging examinations were completed within 24 h after admission. All chest CT images were obtained on SOMATOM Definition (SIEMENS AG, Germany) with patients in the supine position. The main scanning parameters were as follows: tube voltage = 120 kV, tube current modulation (100–300 mAs), slice thickness = 1.0 mm, field of view = 1200 mm × 600 mm. The primary clinical outcome of this study was 30 day mortality after admission. Secondary outcomes included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which was based on the Berlin definition Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and were compared using the Student’s t-test for normally distributed data or as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and tested using the Mann–Whitney U test for non-normal distribution. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages and compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Furthermore, risk factors were evaluated using univariate logistic analysis, and variables with statistical significance (P value < 0.05) in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis using forward stepwise selection based on the likelihood ratio to calculate independent risk factors. A final multivariate model was used to develop the nomogram. The nomogram prediction accuracy was assessed using a calibration curve. The model discriminative ability was assessed by calculating Harrell’s concordance index(C-index) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. A C-index and AUROC of 0.5 indicates the absence of discrimination, whereas a C-index and AUROC of 1.0 indicates a perfect separation of CPP patients from COVID-19. Bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions was used to calculate a corrected C-index and AUROC to confirm the stability and performance of the model. We performed a decision curve analysis to assess the net benefit of using the CPP prediction model. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), GraphPad Prism version 9.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or R-4.1.2 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Differences were considered statistically significant at  Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 450 patients with COVID-19 and 81 patients with CPP were included in our study (Fig.  Baseline characteristics of patients with  Respiration rate, median (IQR), breaths per minute Data are presented as medians (IQR) and n (%).

( CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia are characterized by overlapping clinical symptoms and laboratory results, which makes differential diagnosis challenging during the persisting COVID-19 pandemic. To date, the differences between the two conditions have only been described in case reports The treatment and prognosis of CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia are different; therefore, it is important to differentiate these conditions based on early clinical manifestations and laboratory results. Our research showed that there are similarities and differences between CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia. In our study, the age, sex, and underlying disease distributions of CPP and COVID-19 were similar. Furthermore, our research showed that CPP and COVID-19 usually show similar clinical symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Recently, studies have shown that C. psittaci can be transmitted from person to person in a variety of ways, with the same characteristics of clustering outbreaks as COVID-19, including outbreaks in families and hospitals Therefore, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CPP is likely to be misdiagnosed as COVID-19. However, there were some differences in the clinical symptoms between the two groups. In our study, a higher proportion of patients with CPP exhibited fever, chills, sputum, and nervous system symptoms (46.9% vs. 9.6%,  In terms of blood biochemical tests, both C. psittaci and COVID-19 pneumonia had high CRP, LDH, and D-dimer levels, and low levels of lymphocytes and albumin. However, our study found that patients with CPP had higher inflammatory indicators (WBC, neutrophil and CRP), liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and LDH), BUN, creatinine, creatine kinase, and D-dimer levels and lower lymphocyte, platelet, and albumin levels than patients with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that both psittacosis and COVID-19 can cause liver and kidney damages In terms of imaging, significant differences were observed between the two groups. In our study, patients with COVID-19 often showed ground-glass opacity in both lungs, whereas patients with CPP often had lung consolidation and pleural effusion. Previous studies have shown that peripheral ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs are typical features of COVID-19 on CT scans The results of etiological detection are significant for differential diagnosis. Using RT-PCR to amplify viral RNA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, although it is time consuming (requiring 3–4 h to complete the test), and up to 20% to 67% of patients may have false-negative test results In the current study, the clinical data of 81 CPP cases and 450 COVID-19 cases were described, and the clinical features of the two groups were compared and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression showed that nervous system symptoms, lymphocyte count, creatine kinase level, bilateral lung lesions, and ground-glass opacity were risk factors for patients with CPP. Based on these five risk factors, we developed a nomogram to differentiate CPP from COVID-19. The nomogram exhibited good accuracy in distinguishing CPP from COVID-19 with a good C-index of 0.989. The calibration curve overlapped with the ideal line, demonstrating that the predicted possibilities based on the nomogram were consistent with the actual observations. In terms of clinical utility, the decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was feasible for clinical work. This was reflected by the threshold probability for the net benefit associated with application of the nomogram in differentiating CPP from COVID-19, which ranged from 0.01 to 0.98. There are many similarities between CPP and COVID-19 in terms of clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations. At present, there is still a lack of specific, simple, and reliable diagnostic methods. The nomogram that we proposed combines patient clinical symptoms as well as readily available laboratory and imaging results to reasonably predict CPP, and allows for rapid or even direct diagnosis possible. Our study had some limitations. First, due to the limitations of commercial clinical diagnostic kits, all patients with CPP in our study were diagnosed using mNGS, which may underestimate the incidence of CPP. Second, as this was a retrospective study, we did not establish an external verification cohort to evaluate the predictive accuracy and clinical usefulness of our nomogram. However, our nomogram showed a satisfactory C-index, and was in good consistency with the actual observations reflected by the calibration curve. It also exhibited good clinical utility verified by the decision curve analysis. Third, although the nomogram can rapidly and accurately distinguish between CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia, the clinical benefits of the clinical management strategy based on our nomogram need to be confirmed by a large sample size and prospective studies. Finally, the data of the CPP cohort were generated over 5 years, while that of the COVID-19 cohort were generated within a 3-month period, which may have affected the results of our study. In conclusion, although there are many similarities in the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of both types of pneumonias, there are some characteristic manifestations that may help in differentiating CPP from COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients with CPP are more likely to exhibit nervous system symptoms and higher creatine kinase levels. However, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a greater disposition to present with bilateral lung lesions, ground-glass opacity, and a higher lymphocyte percentage. Moreover, we established a nomogram for the differential diagnosis of CPP and COVID-19 pneumonia, which will help in avoiding misdiagnosis and allowing effective clinical decision making.","['Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia', 'COVID-19', 'Differential diagnosis', 'Nomogram', 'Risk factors', 'Risk factors', 'Respiratory tract diseases']",2024-10-11,Scientific Reports,Chlamydia
11469534,Sore Throat to Still’s: Group A Streptococcus Causing Adult-Onset Still’s Disease,"Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare hyper-inflammatory disease with poorly understood etiology, often presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, inflammatory polyarthralgia, transient salmon-pink maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. We are presenting an unusual case of AOSD triggered by Group A streptococci (GAS) throat infection. We report the case of a 37-year-old male with no significant medical history admitted to medicine service after three emergency room (ER) visits. Our patient had a confirmed GAS throat infection and initially met the Jones criteria. However, further testing revealed significantly high inflammatory markers, clinically evident symmetrical synovitis in wrists and left knee, and widespread lymphadenopathy with worsening maculopapular rash. Given this, he met the Yamaguchi criteria, resulting in a diagnosis of AOSD. Group A Streptococcus infections are usually linked to acute rheumatic fever (ARF), but in our case, we believe GAS infection triggered the cascade of inflammatory responses resulting in AOSD. The patient received treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and high-dose steroids with a resolution of arthralgia, down-trending ferritin, and clinical improvement in a skin rash. To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting the first case of GAS-triggered AOSD, highlighting the need to uncover atypical causes for AOSD and warranting the need to investigate triggers for AOSD.","Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an uncommon systemic autoimmune disorder with poorly understood etiology and often is a diagnosis of exclusion that contributes to delay in diagnosis, so it is crucial to have a clear diagnostic flow [ A 37-year-old Ecuadorian male with no known medical history was initially evaluated in the ER on day three after his symptoms started for a pruritic rash on his upper back and left lower abdomen. During the first ER visit, there were concerns about shingles or insect bites; the patient was discharged from the ED after a dose of diphenhydramine with hydrocortisone 1% topical cream because of a localized allergic reaction. The patient had an insidious onset of arthralgias one to two weeks after the initial ER visit with subjective fevers and persistent rash; all the symptoms were getting worse. The patient later returned to the ER on day 62 with complaints of flu-like symptoms, intense joint pains, intermittent subjective fever, and chills with a persistent rash on the chest. The patient was found to have a febrile temperature of 38.7°C in triage with tachycardia of 107 beats per minute (bpm). His lab reports were significant for a positive throat swab for GAS, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11,000 cells/μL, AST of 43 IU/L, and ALT of 87 IU/L. His chest X-ray was negative for acute pathology. The patient was treated with clindamycin 900 mg IV and discharged from the ER with a diagnosis of GAS throat infection and was prescribed a short course of oral clindamycin. The patient returned to the ER a few days later, on day 69, with persistent but worsening sore throat, muscle aches, joint stiffness, and intermittent fever. He was febrile in the ER with a temperature of 38.8 °C and tachycardia of 112 bpm. The patient denied any recent travels or hiking. His labs were significant for elevated WBC of 19,900 cells/μL, AST of 58 IU/L, ALT of 149 IU/L, nonreactive HIV antigen-antibody, lactic acidosis of 4.5 mmol/L, CRP of 232 mg/L, ESR of 96 mm/hr. Sepsis protocol was initiated, and the patient received weight-based fluid resuscitation, received intramuscular penicillin G injection 1.2 million units with a stat dose of vancomycin 1,500 mg, with minimal symptomatic relief. A CT scan of the neck with IV contrast was normal; the patient was discharged from the ED the same day and recommended to follow up with a primary care provider (PCP). However, the patient returned to the ED on day 72 with a worsening rash (Figure  The patient denied any sick contacts and was admitted to the medicine service with suspicion of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) secondary to GAS. The patient was started on empirical antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-sulbactam for GAS infection treatment; on the fourth visit, admission, labs were significant for persistent leucocytosis and further worsening. Reports of AST of 460 IU/L/ALT of 847 IU/L and ultrasound of the abdomen showed diffuse hepatic steatosis with a nonreactive viral hepatitis panel for hepatitis A, B, and C. During the initial days of admission, the patient complained of migratory arthralgia in the bilateral wrist, right shoulder, right knee, and left ankle with redness or swelling of affected joints. X-ray imaging of affected joints showed no acute pathology; a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis done with contrast was notable for bilateral atelectasis. no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy were noted. Antistreptolysin-O and anti-Dnase titles were found to be in normal ranges. We considered several differential diagnoses, focusing mainly on infection mimics such as ARF due to the overlap in symptoms with AOSD. Other mimics, like infections, including viral as well as bacterial, were ruled out as per infectious diseases consult. Hematology was consulted and recommended that his symptoms and labs were consistent with inflammatory syndrome rather than malignancy. On day 75, naproxen 500 mg twice daily was started; during the days following appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) dosing, arthralgia resolved on day 78. The patient had symptomatic relief; however, he did have a persistent rash and worsening liver function and was found to have hyperferritinemia of 88,000 ng/mL and an IL-2 level of 13,277 pg/mL. The patient met the Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD, including arthralgia for more than two weeks, typical rash, a WBC count of more than 10,000 cells/μL, sore throat, and abnormal liver enzymes, with GAS being the suspected triggering factor. Figure  PO: per oral; QD: four times a day Clinical exam and hyperferritinemia of 92,999 ng/mL were suggestive of severe systemic inflammation and organ involvement-liver, associated with AOSD, hence, three days of methylprednisone 1,000 mg was given from day 83 till day 85, resulting in quick resolution of symptoms, followed by slow tapering, high dose steroids during the inpatient stay. One mg/kg oral prednisone was used due to the persistence of severe symptoms or organ involvement, significantly elevated inflammatory markers as listed in Table  WBC: white blood count; NA: not available; GAS: Group A  AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug CRP: C-reactive protein; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug A skin biopsy was done, and it showed perivascular dermatitis with extravasated erythrocytes and rare eosinophils and neutrophils. The patient was discharged on day 91 after an extended inpatient stay on oral prednisone 60 mg daily. The patient was seen in an outpatient setting on day 99 and found to have a resolving rash on physical examination and a further downtrend in inflammatory markers; the patient was continued on prednisone 60 mg four times a day (QD). Following the clinic visit on day 114, the patient was tolerating slow tapering of steroids and was noted to have decreased left knee effusion; however, the patient reported bilateral knee pain and left elbow pain. The patient was started on methotrexate 7.5 mg and prednisone was tapered down to 50 mg QD. Methotrexate is typically initiated at 15-25 mg/week in autoimmune diseases like AOSD. We started with 7.5 mg as there were concerns about liver function (elevated liver enzymes) but it was increased to 15 mg/week on the next follow-up visit after blood showed normalization of liver function. We tapered steroids along with starting methotrexate, hence, to achieve disease control with the tapering and eventual discontinuation of steroids, we transitioned the patient to steroid-sparing agent methotrexate. Table  Adult-onset Still's disease is a rare clinical entity. Due to the lack of definitive diagnostic tests, diagnosing AOSD is challenging, and clinical criteria hold an essential place in diagnosing this life-threatening condition. Yamaguchi criteria is widely used in diagnosing AOSD; major criteria include fever of at least 39°C for at least one week, arthralgia or arthritis for at least two weeks, non-pruritic salmon-colored rash on the trunk/extremities, granulocytic leukocytosis (10,000/mL or greater), and minor criteria are sore throat, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, and negative in tests for rheumatoid factor (RF) and ANA. [ Though our patient had three ED visits for on and off subjective fevers, sore throat, non-resolving rash, and worsening migratory polyarthralgia, he was admitted to the medicine floor after eight weeks of initial clinical presentation, therefore, having high clinical suspicion is crucial to prevent delayed or misdiagnosis. Presentation of AOSD is often found to be very similar to other systemic diseases [ The proposed mechanism for AOSD is similar to other autoimmune diseases, likely secondary to various triggers in genetically predisposed individuals [ Given widespread microbial and non-microbial triggers, there is growing evidence that infections could cause these rare disorders. Due to the growing incidence of these infections, investing resources to study the agents inducing inflammatory responses resulting in autoimmunity is appropriate. Although it is well known that GAS pharyngitis patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent ARF and eradicate GAS carriage, patients who have had ARF benefit from long-term antibiotics in terms of preventing recurrences and severity of ARF in subsequent attacks [ Our case report highlights the difficulty with diagnosing AOSD. As this is a clinical diagnosis, the most commonly used is the Yamaguchi criteria. However, these criteria have high sensitivity but very low specificity, so high clinician suspicion aided by diagnostic criteria and blood work can help diagnose these inflammatory syndromes. Along with diagnosing the disease, understanding the etiology would push clinicians to suspect these rare pathologies. Multiple authors have reported cases in the literature to identify various triggering factors. The case we are reporting is to isolate GAS as one of the etiologies for AOSD, although further epidemiological studies are needed to quantify the genuine associated risk with these triggers.","['adult-onset acute rheumatic fever', 'adult-onset still’s disease', 'autoinflammatory disease', 'group a β hemolytic streptococci', 'hyperferritinemia']",,Cureus,Chlamydia

En cuanto a los antecedentes personales, la mayoría no presentaba antecedentes de interés. Todos ellos referían un desarrollo psicomotor acorde a su edad y tan sólo el 21,4% de la muestra presentaba obesidad. Otros antecedentes asociados han sido tratamiento corticoide prolongado (desencadenada al inicio de la pauta de descenso del tratamiento), tratamiento con GH por talla baja, etc. No se han encontrado enfermedades autoinmunitarias ni anomalías venosas cerebrales y, como hallazgo causal, se ha evidenciado malformación de Arnold-Chiari en uno de los pacientes. El motivo de consulta principal fue una cefalea subaguda, presente en el 71,4% de los casos, de características opresivas sin sonofobia ni fotofobia acompañante en la mayoría de ellos. Otros motivos de consulta fueron edema de papila, evidenciado de forma casual en una exploración oftalmológica rutinaria (28,5%), y disminución de la agudeza visual (21,4%). La exploración física en todos los casos fue normal, salvo en uno de ellos que presentaba paresia del VI par craneal derecho.

Otras pruebas complementarias solicitadas fueron un electroencefalograma y una tomografía de coherencia óptica, que se llevó a cabo en 11/14 pacientes y fue patológica en nueve de ellos. El principal hallazgo fue un aumento del grosor de las capas de fibras nerviosas.

Cabe destacar la importancia de realizar una tomografía de coherencia óptica para monitorizar tanto la progresión de la enfermedad como la eficacia del tratamiento [ En cuanto a las pruebas de neuroimagen, se considera de elección la resonancia magnética cerebral [ A través de la punción lumbar estudiaremos tanto la composición del LCR (que debe ser normal en la HII) como la medición de la presión de su salida. En el caso de lactantes, al presentar la fontanela abierta, no hay consenso unánime sobre la cifra de presión intracraneal que se considera normal [ Los principales objetivos del tratamiento son disminuir la presión intracraneal, mejorar la sintomatología y prevenir la principal complicación de estos pacientes, el deterioro visual por atrofia del nervio óptico. En los pacientes con sobrepeso u obesidad es importante incidir en la pérdida de peso, junto con una dieta restrictiva en sodio. En el paciente de nuestra muestra en el que la HII se asociaba al tratamiento con GH, se suspendió el tratamiento con resolución completa de la clínica. El tratamiento médico de primera línea utilizado en la población pediátrica es la acetazolamida, un inhibidor de la anhidrasa carbónica que disminuye la producción de LCR. Otras alternativas terapéuticas son el topiramato (más utilizado en población adulta) o la furosemida, asociados o no a acetazolamida. En ocasiones, si en el momento del diagnóstico la afectación visual es grave, pueden utilizarse ciclos cortos de prednisona o metilprednisolona, sin olvidar que tanto el tratamiento prolongado con corticoides como su retirada brusca puede favorecer el desarrollo de HII. En nuestra serie, en el 36% de los casos, la clínica se autolimitó, sin precisar ningún tipo de tratamiento; sin embargo, en el 57% de los casos se instauró tratamiento con acetazolamida con buena respuesta (en tres casos ha sido preciso añadir furosemida, y en un paciente, un ciclo corto de corticoterapia). Como última opción terapéutica, está descrita la fenestración de la vaina del nervio óptico o la colocación de válvulas de derivación ventriculoperitoneal, pero dichas técnicas se reservan para los casos de persistencia de la clínica a pesar del tratamiento médico o si el deterioro visual es rápido. La realización de punciones lumbares evacuadoras seriadas está desaconsejada en los últimos estudios. El pronóstico suele ser favorable, si bien no podemos olvidar que hay casos de HII fulminante con evolución tórpida y que suelen presentar un deterioro de la agudeza visual rápidamente progresivo desde el inicio del cuadro que precisan un abordaje terapéutico inmediato y más agresivo. Lo habitual suele ser que la cefalea y la diplopía mejoren a los pocos días, aunque es preciso un seguimiento oftalmológico estrecho. El papiledema es el predictor más importante de pérdida de visión en estos pacientes [ La HII en la edad pediátrica es una enfermedad poco frecuente; sin embargo, se ha descrito un aumento de la incidencia en los últimos años. Es fundamental un diagnóstico y un tratamiento precoces para evitar posibles secuelas irreversibles, y destaca la importancia del seguimiento multidisciplinar y coordinado entre neuropediatras, oftalmólogos y neurocirujanos. No debemos olvidar que se trata de un diagnóstico de exclusión, de ahí la necesidad de orientar las pruebas complementarias que han de realizarse, y es de vital importancia la valoración del fondo de ojo y la realización de la tomografía de coherencia óptica para valorar la eficacia del tratamiento.","['Acetazolamida', 'Agudeza visual', 'Cefalea', 'Hipertensión intracraneal', 'Líquido cefalorraquídeo', 'Papiledema', 'Acetazolamide', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Headache', 'Intracranial hypertension', 'Papilledema', 'Visual acuity']",2024-8-01,Revista de Neurología,Chlamydia
11468966,Sublingual Boosting with a Novel Mucoadhesive Thermogelling Hydrogel Following Parenteral CAF01 Priming as a Strategy Against ,"
 The optimal thermosensitive, mucoadhesive and stable hydrogel (OGEL) developed through artificial intelligence tools within the concept of “Quality by Design” is useful as a carrier for chlamydia subunit vaccine CTH522. The sublingual administration of OGEL/CTH522, after parenteral immunization with CAF01/CTH522 (cationic liposomes), promotes Th1&Th17 immune responses in a mouse model and elicit local IgA response in the genital tract.
","Sexual transmitted infections lead to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Their high incidence rate has a great impact on healthcare systems, causing high social and economic costs. Mucosal surfaces are the main entry site for most pathogens—including Ct—and are therefore protected by a highly specialized immune system. The stimulation of the mucosal immune system by pathogen invasion or vaccination can induce both systemic and local mucosal immune responses. Nasal mucosa has been used as an effective immunization route against Chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections. The sublingual route is accessible for drug administration and patient‐friendly. Moreover, sublingual tissue contains plenty of antigen‐presenting dendritic cells that can recirculate to distant lymph nodes and spleen, and also induce IgA and IgG antibodies and cytotoxic T cells in the genital tract. A promising strategy could be the development of mucoadhesive thermogelling hydrogels. These formulations can be easily administered under the tongue due to their liquid nature and resist wash out by becoming semisolid at body temperature. As described above, the combination of systemic and mucosal routes is beneficial to induce more robust immune responses against Chlamydia. The aim of the present work was to explore the usefulness of sublingual boosting with vaccine‐loaded mucoadhesive thermosensitive hydrogels posterior to systemic priming as a strategy for immunization against Chlamydia. For this purpose, the Chlamydia CTH522 vaccine antigen was administered in two sequential doses. First subcutaneously using CAF01 as adjuvant and then sublingually using either CTH522 alone or loaded into hydrogels. The capacity to induce immune responses of two sequential sublingual administrations with the CTH522‐loaded hydrogel was also evaluated. Pluronic F127 (PF127) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma‐Aldrich (USA). Hybrane S1200 (HS1200) was acquired from Polymer Factory (Sweden). Gantrez AN119 (AN119) was kindly provided by Ashland (Spain). Trehalose 6,6´dibehenate (TDB) and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (USA). Cell Strainers presenting a pore size of 40 µm and 100 µm were purchased from Corning Incorporated (USA). Purified rat anti‐mouse IL‐17A, biotin rat anti‐mouse IL‐17A, purified rat anti‐mouse IFN‐ The database generated in our previous investigation (Table  Data were split into two sets, 16 records for training and 3 for error testing. The parameters selected for INForm modeling are shown in  Training parameters used for INForm modeling The accuracy of the ANN models was assessed using the determination coefficient ( The optimal hydrogel formulation (OGEL) obtained following the INForm model was produced following the protocol previously reported by Garcia‐del Rio et al. A rheometer AR1000‐N (TA Instruments, UK) was used to estimate hydrogels' storage (G′) and loss moduli (G″), using a cone‐plate geometry of 6 cm Ø and 2.1 degrees. Both moduli were recorded from 15 to 40 °C at 0.4 °C min A TA XT plus Texture Analyzer (Surrey, UK) was used to obtain the texturometric profile of the optimized hydrogels. All texturometric properties (mucoadhesion, gel strength, adhesion, and cohesion) evaluated in this work were performed at 37 °C following protocols previously described. Briefly, bovine buccal tissue was used as a model of oral mucosa to measure mucoadhesion work. Buccal mucosa was cut into pieces of 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm and glued to the punch of the texturometer, then a Petri dish containing 3 g of OGEL was attached to the lower support of the texturometer. The punch descended at 1 mm s To estimate gel strength, adhesion work, and cohesion, two compression cycles were performed. As for mucoadhesion, the punch descended at 1 mm s Bovine serum albumin (BSA), having a similar molecular weight to CTH522, The effect of storage on the properties of OGEL was evaluated after one year at 4 °C in closed containers. Texturometric, rheological, and release properties were re‐analyzed after storage. CAF01 liposomes were obtained through the hydration method, allowing the formation of large and heterogeneous multilamellar vesicles as it was previously reported. CAF01 and OGEL formulations were loaded under sterile conditions with the antigen selected, the recombinant CTH522 chlamydia protein. CAF01 liposomes were loaded by dissolving CTH522 in Tris‐buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) supplemented with 9% trehalose and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with CAF01. The final CTH522 concentration was 0.025 µg µl An accurate amount of CTH522 stock solution was added to OGEL hydrogel to achieve an antigen concentration of 0.2 µgµl Animal experiments were conducted at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) according to the regulations established by the Danish Ministry of Justice and animal protection committees by the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate Permit 2017‐15‐0201‐01363 and in compliance with the European Community Directive 2010/63. All protocols have been subjected to ethical review and approved by SSI. Seven to nine‐week old CB6F1 female mice were housed at SSI and handled by authorized staff. Animals were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 4 consisted of three animals, while groups 2 and 3 consisted of four and five animals, respectively. The immunization schedule is depicted in  Immunization schedule and experimental groups tested. Animals were primed subcutaneously (s.c) or sublingually (s.l) using CAF01 and OGEL as vaccine delivery systems, respectively. Thus, mice from Groups 1, 2, and 3 were immunized with CAF01/CTH522 (s.c) meanwhile Group 4 was mucosally vaccinated with OGEL/CTH522 (s.l). On days 15 and 35, except animals from Group 1, mice were boosted twice through sublingual (s.l) route with CHT522 alone (Group 2) or loaded into OGEL formulation (Groups 3 and 4). Groups 1 to 3 were subcutaneously primed at the base of the tail with 200 µl of CAF01/CTH522, which contained 5 µg of CTH522, 250 µg of DDA, and 50 µg of TDB. Group four was sublingually primed with 10 µl of OGEL (OGEL/CTH522), which contained 2 µg of CTH522 dispersed in the hydrogel. After mucosal vaccination, mice were placed in ante‐flexion posture for 20 min. Then, groups 2 to 4 were boosted twice sublingually (days 15 and 35), with 2 µg of CTH522 alone (Group 2) or included within 10 µl of OGEL system (Groups 3 and 4). Group 1, vaccinated only with CAF01/CTH522 was established as control. Mice were euthanized 3 weeks after the last mucosal boosting. At the end of the study, an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for the quantification of IgA and total IgG in serum and vaginal lavage. Briefly, blood samples were collected from the tail vein in a heparinized tube (1% w/v heparin) and centrifuged at 10 000  IFN‐ Results from hydrogel characterization and in vivo experiments are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM). SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics 26) was employed to perform a one‐way ANOVA and HSD Tukey's post hoc tests ( Combinations of PF127, HS1200, and AN119 polymers have been demonstrated to be useful for obtaining thermosensitive and mucoadhesive hydrogels. The properties of the optimal hydrogel composition (OGEL) selected by INForm following Table  Values predicted by the ANN model and experimental values for the parameters characterized for OGEL freshly prepared and after 1 year of storage at 4 °C in closed containers The mucoadhesive character of OGEL is shown in  Image of OGEL after the contact with the bovine buccal tissue using the settings for the texturometric properties assessment. A mouse study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of OGEL as a sublingual vaccine carrier against Chlamydia. Thus, mice were administered CTH522 in CAF01 subcutaneously or followed by a sublingual boost. In addition, sublingual vaccination alone was also evaluated. We established parenterally immunized animals with CAF01/CTH522 as the control group due to naïve animals did not show CTH522‐specific antibodies and cytokines (Figures  Total IgG and IgA determined by ELISA in serum A, B) and vaginal lavage C, D). The  Optimal vaccination against  IFN‐ The use of mucosal tissues as a vaccination route is grounded in the fact that most infections are initiated at the mucosal surfaces. Parenteral vaccines may be effective when the infection occurs in the urogenital tract because it is more permeable to the transudation of serum antibodies than other mucosae. The antibody titers however must be high, The promotion of high IgA titers able to neutralize pathogens at the target mucosal surface(s) is extraordinarily challenging, even when a mucosal tissue is used as an immunization site. Sublingual vaccination can induce IgA responses with similar mucosal tropisms to nasal vaccination, but is generally considered less immunogenic. The liquid texture of OGEL facilitates its application and extension on the sublingual mucosa, while its thermosensitive properties allow a fast sol‐gel transition at body temperature, avoiding formulation leakage by swallowing. Furthermore, a highly mucoadhesive hydrogel should increase the contact time with the sublingual epithelium and facilitate antigen uptake. These properties make OGEL a good candidate as a vaccine carrier for this route of administration. Previous studies have used CAF01 as a vaccine adjuvant against Chlamydia, Our results point to a synergistic effect of parenteral and sublingual vaccination, as mice immunized by the two routes produced higher IgA titers and developed stronger cellular responses in splenocytes and cervical lymph nodes than when using a single route. Similar results were observed in mice simultaneously vaccinated intramuscularly and intranasally with  The results herein described that sublingual boosting after systemic priming could be a feasible strategy to induce systemic as well as mucosal immunity in the genital tract. In addition, our results suggest that the use of mucoadhesive vaccine delivery systems could be a strategy to maximize the boosting effect of sublingual immunization and therefore, improve mucosal immune responses in the genital tract. However, the success of this approach will depend on the development of highly mucoadhesive vaccine carriers capable of promoting a fast antigen permeation through sublingual tissue, thus ensuring an adequate stimulation of the immune system. Sublingual administration of CTH522 loaded OGEL after subcutaneous CAF01/CTH522 priming elicited IgA responses in serum and vaginal fluids, as well as IFN‐ Mouse oral anatomy differs from that of humans, particularly regarding the sublingual mucosa, which is highly keratinized in mice. High levels of keratinization strongly hinder the permeability of active substances across tissues. ANN together with genetic algorithms has demonstrated its potential to optimize a ternary hydrogel formulation through a reduced experimental design, giving rise to OGEL, a highly mucoadhesive and thermosensitive hydrogel suitable as a vaccine carrier for sublingual administration. OGEL has shown utility as a carrier of the chlamydia vaccine CTH522 in a mouse model. The co‐administration of CAF01 and OGEL loaded with CTH522 subunit vaccine significantly enhanced IFN‐ The authors declare no conflict of interest.

11468210,Barriers and facilitators to women’s access to sexual and reproductive health services in rural Australia: a systematic review,"Accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in rural Australia presents complex challenges that negatively impact women’s health and exacerbate health inequities across the life course. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the barriers and facilitators to women’s access to SRH services in rural Australia, considering both supply and demand dimensions. We systematically searched peer-reviewed literature published between 2013 and 2023. Search terms were derived from three major topics: (1) women living in rural Australia; (2) spatial or aspatial access to SRH services; and (3) barriers or facilitators. We adopted the “best fit” approach to framework synthesis using the patient-centred access to healthcare model. Database searches retrieved 1,024 unique records, with 50 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed access to primary care services ( This review highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to address SRH service access disparities in rural Australia. Understanding the barriers and facilitators women face in accessing SRH services within the rural context is necessary to develop comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions informed by a nuanced understanding of rural women’s diverse needs.

Insufficient information primarily related to gaps in the information provided by GPs around maternity care providers [ Three main barriers emerged related to women’s ability to perceive healthcare: low health literacy, limited awareness, and difficulties in navigating the health system. The barrier of low health literacy was predominantly related to cervical screening [ Two main facilitators were identified for approachability: health system improvements and enhanced education and institutional approaches. Health system improvements pertained to changes to the health system, such as providing culturally accessible information and roles for Aboriginal Health Practitioners (AHP) to work with the community and coordinate access to screening services [ Three facilitators were identified for women’s ability to perceive healthcare: information access, knowledge and awareness, and culturally appropriate information. Information access was primarily related to internet access, as this was the most common way women accessed information, and ease of access to information determined the choice of provider [ Acceptability relates to cultural and social factors that affect a woman’s ability to accept or seek health services or aspects of them. For example, the gender or social group of the provider or the beliefs associated with systems of medicine may reduce the acceptability of seeking care [ Three primary barriers were identified for acceptability: negative provider attitudes, low-quality care, and privacy concerns. Negative provider attitudes were frequently reported by women and included GPs’ unwillingness to refer for abortion services or denying care altogether, leaving women needing to locate willing providers themselves [ Three barriers were identified for women’s ability to seek healthcare: lack of cultural safety, stigma, embarrassment and perceived judgment, and community context challenges. Lack of cultural safety primarily affected maternity care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, whereby standard maternity care was not deemed culturally safe, with limited cross-cultural understanding of medical care [ Three facilitators were identified for acceptability: inclusive and culturally sensitive practices, enhanced privacy with flexible service delivery, and improved health system practices. Culturally sensitive practices involved ensuring cultural safety and consulting women on their cultural needs around birth [ The main facilitator for women’s ability to seek healthcare was related to care preferences. Birthing in the local community was reported to be a positive experience for women [ Availability and accommodation refer to the ability to access health services and healthcare providers, both physically and promptly. Availability means enough health resources to provide services, including the providers’ characteristics (e.g., presence of the health professional, qualification) and how services are delivered [ Three barriers were identified for availability and accommodation: poor local access, inadequate health service availability, and limited provider availability. Poor local access was related to the lack of and fragmented local services. For example, ultrasound or pathology services were not available at the same location as the care provider, requiring patients to travel [ Three barriers were identified that impacted a woman’s ability to reach healthcare: transportation issues, increased travel, and relocation for care. Transportation issues were particularly relevant for women without a driving licence or car, as they had to depend on public transportation or family and friends [ Facilitators identified for availability and accommodation encompassed the enhancement of local service provision and capacity, and increased resource accessibility. Strategies to enhance local service provision and capacity involved increasing their capacity [ One facilitator was identified for women’s ability to reach healthcare: time and travel efficiency. This was related to telehealth appointments [ Affordability pertains to a woman’s economic ability to allocate resources and time to necessary health services. The direct costs of services, related expenses, and the potential loss of income influence it. Affordability can differ based on the type of service and relies on the ability to acquire the resources needed to cover care costs [ Two primary barriers to affordability were identified: high direct costs and costs associated with essential products. The high direct costs identified across multiple studies included limited bulk-billing options [ Two barriers were found to hinder a woman’s ability to pay for healthcare: high travel-related costs and the financial burden of indirect costs. High travel-related costs were reported in four studies for women who were required to travel for care [ Two facilitators emerged for affordability, including cost reduction strategies, and policy and incentive support. Cost reduction strategies involved the increased use of telehealth services due to lower associated costs [ Service affordability was identified as a facilitator for women’s ability to pay for healthcare. Improving access and availability of MToP appointments and medication in rural areas was found to be much more affordable than accessing SToP [ Appropriateness refers to the overall clinical benefit for the woman and whether the expected health benefits (e.g., improved quality of life) outweigh the potential negative consequences (e.g., time, cost). Appropriateness also includes adequacy, which pertains to the quality of the type and model of services provided and their continuity [ Two barriers were found for appropriateness: limitations in telehealth accessibility and care discontinuities. The limitations in telehealth accessibility were linked to language barriers for non-English speaking women and the absence of visual cues for the visually impaired [ Two barriers were also identified for women’s ability to engage in healthcare, including a lack of support systems and psychological effects. Lack of support systems pertained to women who were required to relocate to give birth. Women who relocated experienced disconnection and distress from leaving family support and also reported inadequate caregiver support for existing children [ Two facilitators were identified for appropriateness, including telehealth accessibility and patient-centred care. One study found that the accessibility of telehealth helped to promote relationship-building with a provider before the patient was required to travel [ Thirty-nine studies (78%) were assessed using the JBI quality appraisal tool for qualitative design, while sixteen studies (32%) were evaluated using the JBI quality appraisal tool for analytical cross-sectional studies. A supplementary file includes the quality appraisal for all studies (see Supplementary file  To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesise the evidence on the spatial and aspatial barriers and facilitators that women experience in accessing SRH services in rural healthcare settings in Australia. This review highlighted significant barriers and facilitators from supply and demand access dimensions. Many of the facilitators to SRH access identified in this review relate to women’s empowerment. Empowerment refers to the ability of women to make choices and exercise agency and decision-making through expanded access to and control over resources and changes to the institutional structures that affect their lives [ Health literacy can contribute to women’s empowerment and agency by giving them the tools to access, understand, and use health information to participate in shared decision-making, which is essential for enabling patient-centred care [ Patient-centred care was a facilitator identified in the appropriateness and ability to engage dimension. Continuity of carer was identified as a significant factor in access to maternity care, also highlighted in other systematic reviews of access to antenatal care in high-income countries [ Despite emphasising patient-centred care, negative provider attitudes pose significant barriers to healthcare access, particularly accessing abortion care in rural areas. A recent scoping review highlighted the relationship between negative attitudes, abortion stigma and quality of care, contributing to the gatekeeping and obstruction of abortion access [ In addition to addressing negative provider attitudes, it is crucial to acknowledge the affordability and ability to pay dimension, as the financial barriers further hinder access to essential SRH services for women in rural areas. Some women in the included studies reported a lack of information and difficulties accessing financial incentives for maternity care relocation, such as Patient Assisted Travel Scheme (PATS) [ Healthcare expenses paid directly by individuals in Australia comprise 17 per cent of the country’s healthcare expenditures [ Beyond the immediate health implications, it is essential to recognise the broader societal benefits associated with improving access to SRH services in rural communities. Addressing the barriers to accessing SRH services in rural areas holds wider societal benefits, including economic and social outcomes [ Considering the critical need to address barriers to SRH access in rural Australia, policymakers must prioritise targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility. First, there is a pressing need for health service redesign and interventions prioritising women’s empowerment and control over their health. Further research across different states, particularly those with significant rural populations (e.g., Western Australia), is essential to capture the diverse needs of these communities and ensure patient-centred care. This includes the prioritisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s voices in developing culturally safe antenatal care models and addressing barriers to antenatal and birthing care, especially in rural and remote Australia. Further, there needs to be a consistent use of geographic classification systems relevant to policy in rural research to facilitate decision-making from findings [ A strength of this systematic review is the use of rigorous and robust methods to identify, appraise and synthesise the literature pertaining to the barriers and facilitators to spatial and aspatial access to women’s SRH services in rural Australian healthcare settings. In particular, the comprehensive search and selection process identified a large number of included studies published in the last ten years. This review builds on existing evidence to understand health service accessibility in Australia [ Identifying the barriers and facilitators for women in accessing essential SRH services within the rural context is a necessary step for the development of comprehensive healthcare policies and interventions that address the diverse needs of rural women. Our study supports the need for targeted interventions to redress disparities in SRH service accessibility in rural areas. These include a comprehensive review of Medicare rebates and PBS subsidised items to enhance affordability and accessibility to SRH care, investment in digital healthcare infrastructure, and health service redesign prioritising co-design and a person-centred approach to ensure the service meets the needs of rural women. Further research is required to target the access barriers to SRH services and address the disparities in health service distribution and health inequity in rural Australia.

11467560,Antimicrobial Consumption and Resistance of Restricted Antibiotics in a Level III Government Hospital,"The objectives of the study were to determine the antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics and to correlate this with resistance rate. A retrospective review of pharmacy dispensing records was conducted in the adult internal medicine wards of a tertiary level teaching hospital in the Philippines between March 2019 to February 2020. Antibiotic consumption was determined using Defined Daily Dose (DDD) per 1000 patient-days (PD). Correlations between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance of restricted antibiotics were done. Outcomes were compared between Ward 1 (with the presence of a unit-dose pharmacist) and Ward 3 (without a unit-dose pharmacist). Both wards showed decreasing trends of piperacillin-tazobactam consumption and increasing trends of ceftazidime consumption from quarter 1 to quarter 4. It was observed that levofloxacin was the most prescribed fluoroquinolone with the highest consumption recorded from March to May 2019 in Ward 3 of 350.2 DDD/1000 PD as compared with ciprofloxacin which has the highest consumption (23.3 DDD/1000 PD) during the period June to August 2019 in Ward 1. Antibiotic resistance of  The restriction and pre-authorization strategy of the AMS program has greatly contributed to the decrease in the consumption of almost all restricted antibiotics. This strategy has been helpful in minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use associated with inappropriate drug therapy. The success of the AMS program has been based on the collective efforts of the AMS team with the implementation of hospital policies, such as the AMS program, across the different sites in the hospital in order to achieve optimum patient health outcomes. It was noted that the resistance rates of ","The rapid emergence of resistant bacterial infections is occurring worldwide, endangering the efficacy of antibiotics. The acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is caused by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Antimicrobial consumption data are collected using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and Defined Daily Dose (DDD) methodology developed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology. Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is a Level III government hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila. It is the largest government hospital within Metro Manila with its 1,500-bed capacity. Since May 2016, the PGH Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) Program has been implemented within the hospital and has been organizing and providing training on AMS to other hospitals. The program is designed to enable antimicrobial prescriber (PGH physicians) as well as antimicrobial dispensers (PGH pharmacists) and practicing nurses, to use antimicrobial agents in the most rational, effective, efficient manner and eventually help curb antimicrobial resistance. The WHO carried out a comprehensive review of antibiotics and classified antibiotics into Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) groups. The main goal is to reduce the use of Watch Group and Reserve Group antibiotics, the most crucial antibiotics for human medicine and are at higher risk of resistance, and increase the use of Access Group. In accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and its 2016 IRR, the principal investigator has complied with the institution’s policies on handling patient information. Data collection started after securing the approval of UP Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB) and Extended Hospital Research Office (EHRO) of PGH. All the study team members have ensured the data privacy and patient’s confidentiality by identifying each patient with subject-generated identification codes to be recorded in the data collection form. Only the members of the research team have accessed to the database all throughout the implementation of study. A retrospective cross-sectional design was conducted between two wards under the Department of Medicine from March 2019 to February 2020. Since retrospective data collection was done manually by checking each patient’s dispensing record, the principal investigator has opted to cover only one-year data. Both wards have a 50-bed capacity in PGH, a level III government hospital. This study determined and compared the antimicrobial consumption of drugs for systemic use (ATC group J01) specifically restricted antibiotics using the DDD per 1000 patient days. Only Ward 5 (neurosciences ward) and Ward 1 (medicine ward) have a unit-dose pharmacist in the entire charity In-patient wards. The Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 were chosen because these were comparable based on the differences of medication distribution system. Ward 1 has a modified unit-dose drug distribution system (MUDDDS) with the participation of a unit-dose pharmacist. On the other hand, Ward 3 has an individual medication order system without a unit-dose pharmacist. The study also correlated antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics and antibiotic resistance rate of the top ten resistant microorganisms found in the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3. The study included pharmacy dispensing records of charity in-patients who were admitted and transferred to the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. Patients who were prescribed and dispensed with at least one dose of intravenous restricted antibiotics regardless of age, sex, and co-morbidities were included in the study. The CVR (content validity ratio), also known as Lawshe’s method, was used to quantify content validity of the antibiotic consumption form. Five infectious disease pharmacists, who have undergone training on infectious diseases at University of the Philippines Manila, have been asked to evaluate the validity of the items in the data collection form using the evaluation sheet by indicating whether it is essential (item to be included in the form) or non-essential (item to be removed from the data collection form).
 The result was computed using the above formula. CVR stands for content validity ratio,  The Open ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system was used to gather necessary data needed in the antibiotic consumption form. Data on antibiotic use were collected quarterly from March 2019 to February 2020 and antibiotic consumption data were expressed as DDD per 1000 patient-days. Data on the total number of units or vials were entered and analyzed using Antimicrobial Consumption Tool version 2019 developed by Arno Muller in 2018. Antibiotic resistance (%) were gathered from the antibiogram of the Department of Medicine specifically Ward 1 and Ward 3 provided by the Hospital Infection Control Unit of the hospital. Correlations between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance in each ward were determined for those with at least six (6) observation months or complete information on resistance rates from March 2019 to February 2020. Trend analysis of quarterly consumption of restricted antibiotics was used to analyze pattern of use of antibiotic consumption of restricted antibiotics. Data on antibiotic consumption was converted to DDD per 1000 patient-days. Independent t-test was used in the comparison of antibiotic consumption and comparison of resistance rates between Ward 1 and Ward 3. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to measure the strength of a correlation between antibiotic consumption and antibiotic resistance rates. There were decreasing trends of piperacillin-tazobactam consumption on both wards ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under watch group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020. There was a sudden increase in ciprofloxacin consumption in Ward 1 during June to August 2019 but was of relatively same levels in the remaining quarters of the observation period, while consumption in Ward 3 dropped in the second and fourth quarters ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under watch group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020. For ertapenem, consumption increased from March to November 2019 in both wards but shrank in December 2019 to February 2020 ( Colistin consumption was observed to decrease from quarter 1 through 4 in both wards, with greater consumption levels in Ward 1 compared to Ward 3 except in September to November 2019 ( Quarterly consumption (DDD/1000 patient-days) of restricted antibiotics under reserve group between Ward 1 and Ward 3 from March 2019 to February 2020.

Data can be shared with the AMS team of hospital and relevant information can be further cascaded to other institutions and to Department of Health to track the progress of AMS interventions in reducing antibiotic consumption and resistance. The decreasing trends in consumption of piperacillin-tazobactam showed a decreased use of piperacillin-tazobactam among patients. Based on the antibiogram result, gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated from patients’ samples. Decreasing trend of vancomycin consumption may be associated with its inactivity against gram-negative bacteria, hence, the decreased in usage. The increase in the antibiotic consumption of ceftazidime must be monitored as it has the highest resistance recorded against  Although levofloxacin was the preferred fluoroquinolone compared with ciprofloxacin, its consumption fell in both wards from quarter 1 through quarter 4 due to decreased use in the wards which could mean that prevalence of infection does not require its use. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are both recommended for clinical application in UTIs and, though commonly prescribed, there’s no conclusion on the comparative merit of the either one. Levofloxacin shows advantage over ciprofloxacin in terms of efficacy, disease reoccurrence, and adverse event. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone which exhibit improved intracellular penetration and broadened coverage, which includes  Ertapenem consumption was three times lower as compared with meropenem consumption because the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against  Colistin consumption decreases as polymyxin consumption increases. Internal Medicine residents have opted to use polymyxin as polypeptide antibiotic than colistin. Polymyxin B is administered parenterally in its active form, while colistin is administered parenterally as an inactive pro-drug, colistimethate. In the study of Yadav et al., Based on the study findings, higher resistances of  The result of the present study is similar with the study of Lai et al., Both wards showed decreasing trends in consumption of watch antibiotics except for ceftazidime which could mean that the antimicrobial stewardship program of the hospital is serving its purpose in eliminating unnecessary use of restricted antibiotics. ATC/DDD methodologies are used to compare drug consumption among institutions, regions, and countries. However, DDD does not automatically reflect recommended or average prescribed dose. Instead, it is only a technical unit. It is referred to as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. Patient demographics such as age and sex were confounding variables in the study. As a person gets older, the greater is the risk of having infections due to comorbidities. Previous studies have found that male patients are more at risk of developing infections that would require the use of restricted antibiotics. In this study, the effect of these confounders was minimized by including male and female patients aged 18 to 95. Both medicine wards have the same rotating IM residents who handle the patients. Both wards cater patients who have hypertensive cardiovascular disease, cutaneous and subcutaneous infectious, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, septic shock, diabetes, and hospital acquired pneumonia. The study had several limitations. First, the scope of the study included only one-year data which had led to sparse data in terms of antibiotic consumption and resistance. Second, the measurement of antibiotic use was based on the dispensing record of the pharmacy, not based on those actually consumed by admitted patients. Findings have limited extent of generalizability to other healthcare settings. Investigation of other possible reasons for the increase and decrease of antibiotic consumption was likewise limited because there was no direct access to patient chart. Assessment of clinical practice against set protocols and guidelines was beyond the scope of this study. The restriction and pre-authorization strategy of the AMS program has greatly contributed to the decrease in the consumption of almost all restricted antibiotics. This strategy has been helpful in minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use associated with inappropriate drug therapy. The success of the AMS program has been based on the collective efforts of the AMS team with the implementation of hospital policies, such as the AMS program, across the different sites in the hospital in order to achieve optimum patient health outcomes. There was no significant difference in terms of resistance rates of the top 10 most commonly isolated bacteria. However, it was noted that the resistance rates of  This study has supported the involvement of pharmacists in the AMS team by conducting auditing activities that promote safe compliance of restricted antibiotic use among patients. Pharmacists can greatly participate on either prospective or retrospective review of antibiotic utilization and analyze trends of antibiotic consumption data to provide feedback to prescribing physicians on prescribing patterns and possible correlation with occurrence of antibiotic resistance. Data in the collection and management of antibiotics, monitoring of use, and analyses of gaps for pharmacist-led interventions. With proper support and resources, a prospective study would be ideal in order for pharmacists to participate in antimicrobial stewardship interventions such as evaluation of antibiotic usage, adjustment on the dose for renal dysfunction, switching from parenteral to oral, de-escalation of empiric to narrow spectrum based on antibiogram result, escalation of empiric narrow spectrum to empiric broad spectrum antibiotic based on clinical deterioration of the patient and laboratory indicators as recommended by Boyles et al.","['antibiotic consumption', 'antibiotic resistance', 'restricted antibiotics']",2024-9-13,Acta Medica Philippina,Chlamydia
11467246,The current status of women’s health nursing in the United States,,"With recent political developments in the United States (U.S.), such as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current status of women’s health nursing in the U.S. Initially, it describes the sociopolitical and academic contexts of women’s health nursing in the U.S. Subsequently, it addresses the current issues in women’s health nursing within the realms of education, practice, and research. Finally, the paper offers suggestions for the future of women’s health nursing. Up until the early 1990s, the U.S. did not experience the severe nurse shortages that are witnessed today. During the 1990s, hospital restructuring and downsizing led to numerous reports of hiring freezes and layoffs of registered nurses (RNs) [ Following seminal reports that highlighted lower patient morbidity and mortality rates in hospitals with a higher proportion of RNs [ Currently, the U.S. has fewer than 10 nurses per 1,000 population [ The situation among nursing faculty is similarly dismal. In recent years, virtually all mid-level and top-tier nursing schools in the U.S. have increasingly hired faculty members from outside the country. Specifically, the number of Korean nurse faculty members in the U.S. has grown significantly. In the late 1990s, there were only a few nursing professors of Korean heritage teaching at U.S. nursing schools. However, the Global Korean Nursing Foundation recently estimated that over 100 nursing professors of Korean heritage are currently working across the U.S. (based on per­sonal communication in 2022). Another noticeable trend highlighting the severe lack of nursing faculty in the U.S. is the ease with which Korean Ph.D. graduates, who earn their doctoral degrees in the U.S., can secure faculty positions in the U.S. and choose to stay after completing their degrees. In contrast, it is more challenging for them to obtain faculty positions in South Korea. Most nursing schools in the U.S. are now taking on the additional burden of supporting visas for overseas faculty members to ensure they have an adequate number of faculty members. Indeed, the shortage of nursing faculty has become a severe and inevitable phenomenon in recent years. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has played a pivotal role in shaping the trends and policies of nursing education in the U.S. In 2015, the IOM became the NAM, which subsequently issued a new Future of Nursing report following the COVID-19 pandemic [ The New Essentials led to a major shift in nursing education and nursing practice by emphasizing competency-based education. This focus has prompted extensive revisions in nursing curricula throughout the U.S., establishing the 10 domains of the New Essentials as foundational elements of nursing education. Notably, some updates to the essentials reflect the evolving healthcare needs in the U.S. For example, influenced largely by the COVID-19 pandemic, a new domain focusing on “quality and safety,” particularly in relation to disaster nursing, has been emphasized in the AACN New Essentials. A general sentiment was shared between the Future of Nursing report and the AACN New Essentials regarding these focal points, though there were subtle differences. For example, the Future of Nursing report places a strong emphasis on preparing a workforce well-versed in disaster nursing. In contrast, the AACN mentions disaster nursing under the category of “quality and safety.” Another distinction is seen in the treatment of nursing policy making; it was a prominent feature in the Future of Nursing, whereas in the AACN framework, it is incorporated under the domain of “professional leadership development.” Overall, the tone of the Future of Nursing report is relatively stronger than that of the AACN’s New Essentials. The women’s health workforce in the U.S. primarily consists of obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians, nurses, and physician assistants (PAs). Within the field of OB/GYN, there is a diverse range of board-certified subspecialists, including gynecologic oncology, female pelvic medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and maternal-fetal medicine. Consequently, patients must carefully consider their immediate healthcare needs to choose the appropriate provider. Another emerging trend is the growth of hospitalists, which shifts the focus from private practices to care primarily provided in hospital settings by teams of specialists. Additionally, there is an increasing concern over physician burnout and a decline in the number of clinical scientists. This decline is partly attributed to the fact that providers can maintain a comfortable living solely from clinical practice, avoiding the additional pressures associated with research. Technological advancements have also reshaped the practice of women’s health nurses. Hospitals across the U.S. are integrating new technologies such as robots for transporting supplies, robotic surgery, and the widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs). Despite these advancements aimed at enhancing healthcare delivery, the use of EMRs has been found to potentially increase the distance between providers and patients. This change underscores the growing importance of building strong rapport and interpersonal connections, particularly for nurses in women’s health. To understand the evolving trends, it is worthwhile to review the history of women’s health nursing in the U.S. The 1830s and 1840s marked the beginning of women’s health nursing in the U.S., coinciding with the first wave of feminism [ Some argue that women’s health nursing originated in the 1960s, a time when women’s reproductive rights were restricted and abortion was illegal [ In the 1980s, the conservative political environment gained momentum with the Reagan administration and the dominance of the Republican Party. During this period, anti-abortion activists began advocating for the repeal of legalized abortion. Consequently, feminist health clinics and fertility control clinics increasingly became targets of attack [ The 1980s and 1990s marked a significant period for women’s health, particularly following the formal establishment of the Congressional Caucus for Women’s Health Issues in 1977 as a Legislative Service Organization [ In 1993, a significant milestone was achieved when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a restriction that had been in place since 1977, which prohibited women from participating in new drug testing [ Readers may be familiar with the more recent upheavals since 2020. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn  In 2022, the American Nurses Association (ANA) declared that sexual health is a human right, that abortion is a reproductive health option, and that nurses should have the freedom to discuss these topics with patients to facilitate informed decision-making [ The ANA website currently offers guidelines for nurses operating in states with restrictive laws, advising them to carefully consider the ethical and legal complexities involved. For women’s health practitioners in these restrictive states, extreme caution is necessary for conversation and decision. In practice, many women living in restrictive states travel to states with more permissive laws to obtain abortions, including in situations where the pregnant woman’s life is at risk. This travel incurs significant costs and legal risks for the women involved. For nurse researchers, the NIH, particularly the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), represents the primary source of funding. Consequently, research trends have largely aligned with the focal areas emphasized by the NINR. Dr. Patricia A. Grady, PhD, RN, FAAN, who served as the Director of NINR for over two decades and holds a doctorate in physiology from the School of Medicine at the University of Maryland, championed biobehavioral research that emphasized symptom science and palliative care. This influence is evident in the historical scientific priorities of the NINR, which include symptom science, wellness, end-of-life and palliative care, innovation promotion, and self-management. Accordingly, women’s health research has also been guided by these themes. Examples include studies on managing symptoms during the menopausal transition, encouraging physical activity among women, and fostering self-care for various specific health conditions throughout women’s lifespans. Since September 2020, Dr. Shannon N. Zenk, PhD, MPH, RN, has served as the director of the NINR. Her research interests in community-based studies and health disparities, coupled with the significant challenges posed by COVID-19 at the time of her appointment, have influenced a shift in the NINR’s focus. The Strategic Plan for 2022-2026, developed over the past 2 years, reflects these changes [ NINR has also issued guiding principles ( Under the significant influence of the recently published NIH and NINR strategic plans, research in women’s health that promotes health equity has seen a marked increase. For example, there has been a rise in the number of NIH-funded studies focusing on racial and ethnic minorities, including immigrant women, rural populations, gender minorities such as the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) community, and older adults. Another emerging trend is the growth in NIH-funded community-based participatory research (CBPR) studies. These studies are characterized by their large-scale population-based approach, which ensures meaningful contributions to the community. They also feature active involvement from community gatekeepers and consultants, and direct engagement of participants as team members. Additionally, since the establishment of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute in 2010, following  What are the future directions for women’s health nursing? I believe that nursing education for women’s health must first and foremost undergo curricular changes to align with the new competencies mandated by the AACN essentials across various programs. Additionally, nursing education should include content on new technologies and subspecialties that are evident in practice. Given the multitude of ethical issues within women’s health nursing, this is another critical area for educational focus. Women’s health education also needs to integrate current trends in topics, populations, and methods, particularly at the graduate level. Furthermore, interdisciplinary partnerships in undergraduate education warrant more attention, especially concerning non-nursing preceptors, in light of the general decline in women’s health practitioners and the nursing workforce. Physicians, PAs, and social workers can provide non-traditional practice experiences for nursing students, who in turn can learn about the unique and critical roles these providers play in women’s health. Effective nursing practice in women’s health requires setting clear goals for the future nursing workforce. This approach will facilitate necessary actions, enable tracking of workforce outcomes, and help develop strategies to attract more nurses to the field of women’s health. Given the potential ethical issues associated with women’s health practice, open discussions about ethical contexts are crucial. These discussions can also inform and guide nursing education. Additionally, establishing funding sources for training more women’s health nurses would significantly strengthen the women’s health workforce. For nursing research in women’s health, it is imperative to stay informed about shifts in funding priorities, both nationally and internationally. It is equally important to recognize that research needs will evolve with demographic changes, necessitating the adoption of new methodologies and the integration of technological advancements. Building interdisciplinary research teams is vital, as collaboration is key for nurses to advance women’s health research. Additionally, women’s health nurses should actively engage in shaping and supporting policy changes to promote women’s health research. For example, when funding agencies, including the NIH, are developing their strategic plans, women’s health nurses must participate in the strategic planning process to ensure their research needs are adequately reflected in funding priorities. Lastly, there is a pressing need for more studies on the ethical and legal dilemmas in women’s health to provide the necessary evidence and guidance for women’s health practice and education.",[],2024-9-30,Women's Health Nursing,Chlamydia
11466832,Immunological perspectives on atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression,"Atherosclerosis serves as the primary catalyst for numerous cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence suggests that the immune response is involved in every stage of atherosclerotic plaque evolution. Rapid, but not specific, innate immune arms, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and other innate immune cells, as well as pattern-recognition receptors and various inflammatory mediators, contribute to atherogenesis. The specific adaptive immune response, governed by T cells and B cells, antibodies, and immunomodulatory cytokines potently regulates disease activity and progression. In the inflammatory microenvironment, the heterogeneity of leukocyte subpopulations plays a very important regulatory role in plaque evolution. With advances in experimental techniques, the fine mechanisms of immune system involvement in atherosclerotic plaque evolution are becoming known. In this review, we examine the critical immune responses involved in atherosclerotic plaque evolution, in particular, looking at atherosclerosis from the perspective of evolutionary immunobiology. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between plaque evolution and plaque immunity provides clues for strategically combating atherosclerosis.","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) is a prominent global cause of mortality ( The evolution of atherosclerotic plaques can be broadly categorized into three stages: initiation, progression and complications. It has been shown that fatty streaks are the initial marker of atherosclerosis, which develops in four steps: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol uptake, endothelial cell (EC) activation, leukocyte activation and foam cell formation ( Among the many factors that influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques, the immune system plays a significant role. During the formation and development of atherosclerotic plaques, the local microenvironment undergoes a series of complex changes, accompanied by the infiltration of multiple immune cells. Evidence suggests that circulating monocytes and resident vascular macrophages are the earliest immune cells recruited into early atherosclerotic plaques ( The molecular signals that regulate leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesion sites are complex, and chemokines and their receptors play a key role and have received much attention in the study of atherosclerosis. Chemokines are a class of small, secreted cytokines with chemotactic properties. Depending on the location of their cysteine residues, they can be divided into four subclasses: C, CC, CXC, and CX With the advent and advancement of various experimental techniques, we have gained an understanding of the mechanisms involving the immune system in plaque evolution. Here, we view atherosclerotic plaque lesions from the perspective of evolutionary immunobiology, specifically reviewing the immunologic aspects of plaque evolution, including the immune responses involved, the effects of immune cell heterogeneity, and plaque dynamics in the inflammatory microenvironment. The goal is to provide insight into the search for immunotherapy for atherosclerosis. In 1859, Charles Darwin coined the phrase “natural selection” to describe the process of evolution as observed by the different survival outcomes of individuals under environmental stress owing to phenotypic differences. Natural selection has provided a crucial force in evolution ( Many believe that atherosclerosis is an inevitable progressive process that develops over time, but current evidence supports a more dynamic and discontinuous evolution of the atherosclerotic plaques ( The immune system is categorized into innate and adaptive responses. As the first line of defense against invading pathogens, innate immunity is characterized by its ability to produce rapid and nonspecific responses. The main types of cells in the innate immune system involve neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and DCs ( Evolution of immune cells in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Early in the lesion, monocytes/macrophages predominate. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which can uptake oxLDL to become foam cells, and also differentiate into inflammatory macrophages and IFNICs macrophages, which secrete IL-1, TNF-α, and type I interferon to exert pro-inflammatory effects, respectively; in addition, they can also be polarized into the M1, M4, and Mox phenotypes, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, or MMP, promoting atherosclerosis. In all stages of atherosclerosis, ILC1 is identified as the most abundant subset of ILCs and is involved in reinforcing plaque formation through the production of IFN-γ. Atherosclerotic lesions trigger migration and activation of NK cells as well as release of pro-atherogenic factors IFN-γ and TNF-α. Neutrophils secrete pro-inflammatory mediators such as NETs, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, increasing plaque inflammation and susceptibility to rupture. A large number of B cells with a structure similar to tertiary lymphoid organs are found in the adventitial layer of blood vessels, in which B2 cells secrete mediators that aggravate atherosclerosis such as IgG and BAFF. In advanced atherosclerosis, numerous T cells homing to the plaque. Activated DCs present cognate peptides on MHC class I molecules to CD8 The arterial wall is composed of three main layers: the intima, the media, and the adventitia. The intima is the innermost layer in contact with blood flow and is covered by a single layer of ECs on one side of the lumen (vascular endothelium) and an inner elastic layer on the peripheral side. The media consists mainly of VSMCs surrounded by ECM. The adventitia is composed of fibroblasts and connective tissue ( In addition to endothelial dysfunction, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction is also a key factor in plaque formation. PVAT, a mixture of brown and white adipose tissue that surrounds most of the vascular system, is thought to be an active component of the vascular wall that regulates vascular homeostasis and influences the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( Atherosclerotic plaque formation begins with endothelial dysfunction followed by LDL accumulation and its modification in the intima ( Lipid accumulation stimulates the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines by ECs. EC activation triggers the release of leukocyte adhesion molecules (AMs) and chemokines that stimulate inflammatory monocyte migration and infiltration. Infiltrated monocytes in the intima are stimulated to mature into macrophages by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) produced by activated ECs ( Other innate immune cells such as neutrophils, Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and DCs can also influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Neutrophils are the major responders to tissue damage and infection, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators to neutralize dangers such as toxins ( ILCs are a unique type of lymphocytes that have been newly discovered in recent years. Five distinct subsets have been identified: ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, lymphoid tissue-inducing cells and NK cells. ILCs are mainly localized in barrier tissues such as skin, intestinal mucosa, and lung, and play an important role in innate immune response to infections, lymphangiogenesis, and remodeling of damaged tissues by responding to microenvironmental signals released from surrounding tissue ( NK cells are innate immune system effector lymphocytes that sense pathologic alterations or stressed cells by activating receptors and play a cell-mediated cytotoxic role through the release of granzymes and perforin or cytokines, as in the case of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ( DCs are present in healthy arteries and can accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions. They are especially enriched in rupture-prone areas within atherosclerotic plaques, which can lead to plaque destabilization, and are involved in a variety of pathogenic and protective mechanisms during plaque formation. In the earliest stages of plaque formation, DCs may uptake lipids and form a foam-cell-like appearance, as well as regulate lipid metabolism through other mechanisms ( The antigen-specific adaptive immune responses are triggered after the innate immune response and are mediated by T and B cells ( T cells are recruited into atherosclerotic plaques through a mechanism that resembles monocyte recruitment via the receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which is expressed by all CD4 The CD4 Various studies have come to distinct conclusions about the effects of CD8 Atherosclerotic plaque formation is intensely influenced by diverse arms of the immune system, including B lymphocytes ( The earliest evidence that B cells are involved in atherosclerosis in mice came from Caligiuri et al. ( Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, with inflammation having an essential role in all stages of the pathogenic process, encompassing plaque formation, progression, and rupture. Inflammation is the response to the existence of exogenous and endogenous antigens by the immune system. In general, driven by the immune system, inflammation profoundly influences the evolutionary trajectory of atherosclerotic plaques. Inflammation underlies atherosclerotic plaque formation. Plaque inflammation is driven by cytokines, chemokines, AMs, inflammatory signaling pathways, bioactive lipids, and immune cells ( Infiltration and retention of oxLDL in the arterial wall serve as critical initiating events that trigger the inflammatory response and facilitate atherosclerotic plaque formation ( SRs are distributed on arterial vessel wall cells and vascular ECs, and oxLDL binds to the corresponding receptors to promote the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques through multiple mechanisms. CD36 is a pattern recognition receptor expressed on multiple cell types and is a part of the class B family of SRs. CD36 is not only involved in the uptake of oxLDL and foam cell formation, but also in atherosclerotic plaque formation by interacting with oxLDL and triggering an inflammatory response ( The accumulation of oxLDL and its binding to receptors initiate plaque inflammation, while the infiltration of immune cells, the activation of plaque-associated inflammatory signaling pathways, and the response to host tissues and microorganisms maintain the development of inflammation, thereby further accelerating the evolution of plaque. Infiltration and accumulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory leukocytes in the intima of the arterial wall are hallmarks of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression, as well as drivers of atherosclerotic lesion growth. Immune cell infiltration is triggered by chemokines and AMs ( Signaling pathways that are mediated by immune, inflammatory mediators are associated with the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) serves as the primary transcription factor in the inflammatory response. The NF-κB pathway is induced and activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines and growth factors and exerts a pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque inflammation ( Research into atherosclerotic plaque development has also focused on the host tissues and microorganisms that may influence this process. Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is present in atherosclerotic plaques, where ECs can obtain a mesenchymal phenotype, with loss of expression of EC markers and function, and gain of expression of mesenchymal cell markers and function, directly contributing to plaque evolution ( Furthermore, the presence of microorganisms in atherosclerotic plaques is well recognized. Pathogenic microorganisms are able to infect arterial wall cells, facilitate local inflammation of the plaque, evoke an adaptive immune response and influence plaque progression. For example,  In addition to bacteria, some viruses can also influence the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. For example, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is capable of infecting almost all plaque immune cells, expressing viral cytokines and chemokines to promote an inflammatory environment, and triggering plaque formation through mechanisms such as induction of endothelial damage, increased lipid deposition, and VSMC proliferation and migration ( Leukocyte subsets accumulate at different stages of plaques and are involved in the immune response in the atherosclerotic lesion process. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) reveals heterogeneity of immune cells in atherosclerotic plaques ( Monocytes are heterogeneous populations and human blood monocytes are classified into three subpopulations according to differences in the expression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor CD14 and the FcγIII receptor CD16: classical CD14 Heterogeneity of monocytes/macrophages and DCs in atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and DCs share a common origin in myeloid progenitor (MP). Monocyte-DC precursor (MDP) gives rise to monocytes and common DC precursor (CDP). Among them, mouse monocytes are classified into two subsets according to their surface expression of Ly-6C. Ly6C Different monocyte/macrophage subsets play different roles in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. Classical CD14 Murine monocytes are the most studied. The Ly6C Indeed, macrophage phenotype is influenced by microenvironmental factors within the atherosclerotic plaques. Both M1 and M2 macrophage populations are present and increasing in number throughout the atherosclerotic process ( Recently, many research studies have revealed the presence of other macrophage subsets in atherosclerotic plaques, in addition to M1 and M2 types. M4 macrophages are induced by CXCL4, which is widely expressed in plaques, and exert atherosclerotic effects by producing MMP12, MMP7, and MMP9 leading to increased plaque vulnerability ( Single-cell techniques have greatly improved our understanding of macrophage subsets in plaques.

( DCs are heterogeneous blood-borne professional antigen-presenting cells with the ability to capture, process, and present antigens to T cells that recognize antigens and induce antigen-specific immune responses ( mDCs are characterized by the expression of CD1c, CD11c, and CD33 and they secrete IL-12. In contrast the pDCs express CD123 and produce type I IFN ( Several studies have discussed the role of pDCs in atherosclerotic plaque evolution. In a mouse model of atherosclerosis, depletion of pDCs using multiple antibodies against bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) promotes the accumulation of T cells in plaques, leading to enhanced atherosclerosis in  Pre-DCs are the final precursor stage in the formation of DCs, and they can develop into DCs without dendrites but require further development to obtain dendritic forms and full DC function. Little cell division is involved in their development into DCs, leading to different types of DCs being produced by different pre-DCs, such as some monocytes, pDCs, and cDCs ( In atherosclerotic plaques, T cells are less numerous than monocytes/macrophages, but like monocytes/macrophages that exhibit heterogeneity in markers and function, T cells also exhibit heterogeneity and regulate the adaptive immune response to plaque. CD4 Heterogeneity of CD4 Th1 is the prominent T cell subtype in atherosclerotic lesions and Th1 cytokines predominate in atherosclerotic mouse models and human plaques. They secrete mainly IFN-γ, which exerts a pro-atherogenic effect ( Th2 cells are poorly represented in atherosclerotic plaques, and their function in atherosclerosis is still controversial. Th2 cells typically produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. IL-4 can effectively inhibit the Th1 response, Th1 cytokine formation and IFN-γ secretion, and has atheroprotective effects ( The Th17 subset has been identified in atherosclerosis-prone mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques and its role remains controversial ( Tregs are a highly heterogeneous population of CD4 Using scRNA-seq screening methods, Winkels et al. ( B cells are heterogeneous populations of lymphocytes derived from bone marrow and composed of multiple subsets of cells with distinct localization properties, activation requirements, survival characteristics, and immunoglobulin secretion profiles ( B1 cells are intrinsic immune cells that are usually found in plasma membrane cavities such as the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Without the need for Th cells, both B1a and B1b cells can secrete IgM under antigenic stimulation, which specifically binds to LDL oxidizing epitopes in atherosclerotic plaques and reduces lipid uptake by macrophages, thus decreases the formation of foam cells. At the same time, IgM specifically binds to apoptotic cells so that inflammatory cells can be eliminated, thus slowing down atherosclerosis progression ( B2 cells are what we commonly refer to as mature B lymphocytes, produced in the bone marrow and differentiated in secondary lymphoid tissues. Preliminary studies on the role of B2 cells in atherosclerosis have demonstrated their pro-atherogenic effect. The use of a CD20-specific monoclonal antibody to selectively remove B2 cells, but not B1a cells, from  The variety of functions performed by B cells, such as antibody production, cytokine release, and antigen presentation, as well as the unique ways in which B cells adapt to the inflammatory microenvironment of plaques, have led to different B cell subsets exhibiting complex heterogeneity in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaques. The evolution of atherosclerotic plaques is regulated by both the immune system and inflammatory responses, and the study of immune as well as anti-inflammatory based therapies for atherosclerosis is of great clinical importance. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to IL-1β and blocks the interplay of IL-1β with IL-1R, preventing the inflammatory response from occurring. IL-1β plays multiple roles in the atherosclerotic process, including promoting adhesion of immune cells to vascular endothelial cells, promoting proliferation of VSMCs, and inducing procoagulant activity ( Advances have also been made in the study of antibody immunotherapies targeting other cytokines that play pro-inflammatory roles in plaque evolution, as well as chemokines and their receptors that also have important roles. In patients with psoriatic arthritis, the use of anti-TNF-α antibodies significantly reduced the size of carotid plaques and inhibited plaque development ( Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) mAb has recently been found to exhibit potential therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of atherosclerosis. There are activated subsets of PD-1 Antibody immunotherapy for human atherosclerosis. Antigen-antibody reactions play a pivotal role in the evolution of plaques. Therefore, the use of immunomodulatory strategies to activate immune responses against relevant antigens has the potential to alter the natural course of atherosclerosis. The purpose of vaccination is to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by stimulating the body to produce antibodies that block the target antigen. What has received earlier attention from researchers is LDL-related vaccines. OxLDL is thought to be critical in causing intimal inflammation and foam cell formation in atherosclerosis. One of the most studied is the specific malondialdehyde-modified apolipoprotein B100 (MDA-ApoB100), which is a relatively important oligopeptide fragment of oxLDL molecules with strong antigenicity ( Inflammation is a well-studied therapeutic target, and strategies to control inflammation have been successfully applied against many diseases. After many studies it appears that inflammation has also emerged as an important target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents for atherosclerosis have been extensively studied in recent years. Among the most widely researched and used drugs are statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and are usually used to treat atherosclerosis. They are the drugs of choice for clinical lipid-lowering, with commonly used drugs such as rosuvar, atorval, and simvastatin calcium tablets. Statins exert various anti-inflammatory effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties. Statins can inhibit macrophage growth, reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, downregulate the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines, and prevent monocyte recruitment ( In addition to statins, there are several common anti-inflammatory drugs that are also used to treat atherosclerosis. Colchicine is utilized for treating inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis due to its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity. Its anti-inflammatory mechanism is mainly through downregulation of multiple inflammatory pathways including inhibition of phospholipase A2, reduction of leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2 release from monocytes, inhibition of neutrophil function through microtubule proteins, and reduction of endothelial adhesion, which leads to inhibition of inflammation and increase of plaque stabilization ( Atherosclerosis is defined as an inflammatory disease, with inflammatory responses throughout the disease progression, and inflammatory mediators, cytokines, through inflammatory signaling pathways exerting different roles in the regulation of the plaque inflammatory microenvironment. Many studies have clearly demonstrated that immune responses mediate the entire process of atherosclerotic plaque evolution, including initiation, progression, and thrombotic complications. Crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune pathways strongly regulates plaque activity and progression, while the heterogeneity of immune cells plays a pivotal role in plaque evolution. The evolution of atherosclerosis involves complex interactions of immune cells as well as phenotypic plasticity. Omics studies, especially scRNA-seq, have highlighted the specific transcriptional profiles of various cell lineages at the site of atherosclerotic lesions. The detailed map of the cells revealed not only enhances our understanding of the heterogeneity of different cells in the plaque environment, but also deepens our comprehension of the mechanisms of disease occurrence and progression and provides a solid scientific basis for the development of novel precision therapeutic strategies. By combining high-throughput omics data with experimental studies to analyze the gene expression profiles and functional properties of specific cell subsets, it is possible to develop targeted drugs against specific cell subsets or the immune molecules they produce, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors against PD1 However, the vast majority of investigations into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque pathology have originated from experimental animal models, and there are significant barriers to translating interventions from animal models to the clinic, primarily because mouse models reproduce human atherosclerosis to a very limited extent. It is encouraging that the integration of bioinformatics-, transcriptomics-, and proteomics-based datasets will help us to define the immune profile of human atherosclerosis in a more comprehensive manner. As multidimensional approaches continue to progress, it is expected that the cellular and molecular mediators associated with human atherosclerotic plaques will be characterized in depth, and new potential therapeutic targets will undoubtedly emerge. It is our firm belief that our understanding of immune-mediated processes in atherosclerosis will continue to evolve, and the specific mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque evolution will be further resolved from an immunologic perspective.","['atherosclerosis', 'plaque evolution', 'immune response', 'immune cell heterogeneity', 'inflammatory microenvironment', 'immunotherapy']",2024-9-27,Frontiers in Immunology,Chlamydia
11466150,Exploring the mechanism of Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang in the treatment of rosacea via network pharmacology and molecular docking,"Rosacea is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease affecting the center of the face that causes burning and itching sensations and changes in aesthetics. Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) is a classic herbal formulation that is efficacious and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of rosacea; however, the pharmacological mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of action of LXWHT using network pharmacology and molecular docking. The Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology database was searched to identify the active ingredients and pharmacological targets of LXWHT, and the GeneCard, Disgenet, and Gene Expression Omnibus databases were applied to screen rosacea-related targets. Cytoscape software was used to visualize the protein–protein interaction network, and network topology analysis was used to identify core targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed for the core targets. Molecular docking simulations and visualization were performed using Maestro and PyMOL, respectively. A total of 43 active compounds and 28 potential targets for LXWHT treatment of rosacea were selected for analysis. The Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results indicated that LXWHT may exert therapeutic effects on rosacea by intervening in immune pathways including tumor necrosis factor pathway, interleukin-17 pathways, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Chemokine ligand 2, interferon-γ, interleukin-1ß, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 may be the core therapeutic target. Quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, beta-carotene, baicalein, acetin, and isorhamnetin were predicted to be the key active ingredients. LXWHT may exert therapeutic effects in the treatment of rosacea by modulating immunity and angiogenesis, laying the foundation for further research.","Rosacea is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory dermatological condition that affects the center of the face and manifests as paroxysmal flushing, persistent erythema, papules and pustules, and capillary dilatation; these symptoms are often accompanied by burning and itching, as well as other discomforting sensations. Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) is an effective formula for the clinical treatment of rosacea that consists of the following 5 traditional Chinese medicines: Carthamus tinctorius L. (Hong Hua [HH]), Celosia cristata L. (Ji Guang Hua [JGH]), Campsis grandiflora (Ling Xiao Hua [LXH]), Rosa rugosa Thunb. (Mei Gui Hua [MGH]), and Chrysanthemum indicum L. (Ye Ju Hua [YJH]). According to the traditional theory of Chinese medicine, the formation of rosacea is mainly due to dampness, heat, and blood stasis. The 5 herbs in LXWHT can play the roles of cooling the blood, activating the blood, dispersing wind, and removing toxins. Clinical studies indicate that the application of LXWHT alone or in combination with other agents can significantly reduce the clinical symptoms of rosacea, including facial itching, burning, flushing, and papules, without inducing significant adverse effects. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanisms of action of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea using network pharmacology to screen for the effective ingredients and core targets, as well as molecular docking experiments to verify the interactions between the core targets and the main effective ingredients. Each herbal medicine comprising LXWHT was entered into the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology (TCMSP) database ( The search term “Rosacea” was used to search the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the GSE65914 gene microarray data were selected. The GEO2R online tool was selected to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between rosacea and normal tissues based on fold change and adjusted  The intersection of LXWHT and rosacea target genes was assessed to identify potential targets of LXWHT in the treatment of the disease. More specifically, the herbs, active components, and potential targets of LXWHT were imported into the Cytoscape 3.8.2 software platform (The Cytoscape Consortium, San Francisco), The intersection data of the LXWHT target genes and the rosacea target genes was input into the STRING database ( The intersecting genes were subjected to GO and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analyses and visualized using the GO/KEGG analysis tool v0.2.0 from Hiplot website ( The core proteins were identified from the construction and analysis of the protein interaction networks using the Protein Data Bank ( The active pocket in the molecular docking experiments was defined by the ligands in the core proteins; in cases of proteins without ligands, the active binding sites were defined by the Binding Site Detection module in Schrödinger software, New York City. The binding grid is formed by the Glide module, which uses force-field information to produce frames indicating the possible locations of the ligand centers. The box was generated by directly selecting ligands from a known crystal structure or by simulating the active sites. The protein structure acts as a rigid receptor and each ligand molecule acts as a flexible ligand for semi-flexible docking. Standard Precision mode screening was performed for the docking of key components with defined active pockets, and the binding energy was calculated. Small-molecule ligands and protein receptors were imported into PyMOL 2.4.0 software, (Schrödinger, Inc. New York City) to visualize the molecular docking results. The main active ingredients of the constituents of LXWHT were determined using the TCMSP database based on the oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug-like properties ≥ 0.18 criteria. A total of 43 main active ingredients were obtained from the search: 22 from HH, 12 from YJH, 5 from JGH, 4 from LXH, and 10 from MGH. These results were imported into Cytoscape to construct the “Herb-active Component” (H-C) network diagram of LXWHT, which is depicted in Figure  The “Herb-active Component” (H-C) network diagram of LXWHT. The diamonds represent the herbs comprising LXWHT, whereas the circles represent the active components. HH = Hong Hua, LXWHT = Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang, JGH = Ji Guang Hua, MGH = Mei Gui Hua, YJH = Ye Ju Hua. The TCMSP database was subsequently used to identify the corresponding targets of the active ingredients, which were then imported into the UniProt website and converted into gene symbols. After eliminating duplicate results, 216, 191, 106, 37, and 178 targets were identified for HH, YJH, JGH, LXH, and MGH, respectively. A total of 1070 DEGs were identified in rosacea tissues based on the GSE65914 dataset. We presented these DEGs with heatmaps and volcano plots (Fig.  Demonstration of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GSE65914. (A) Volcano map and (B) Heatmap of DEGs. The Venn diagram identified the overlapping targets between Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang (LXWHT) and rosacea. The herbs, active components, and 28 potential therapeutic targets of LXWHT were imported into STRING to construct the “H-C-T” network of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea (Fig.  “Herb-Component-Target” (H-C-T) network of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea.

The pathogenesis of rosacea is driven by a variety of factors, and, although the precise mechanisms are unknown, it is generally believed that a local immune imbalance, neurovascular dysfunction, and dermal microflora dysregulation occur mainly in individuals with a genetic susceptibility in response to certain external stimuli. LXWHT is efficacious and has commonly been used in the clinical treatment of various facial erythematous diseases, including rosacea, facial dermatitis, and moderate-to-severe acne. We identified 43 active compounds of LXWHT from the TCMSP database, and 28 putative therapeutic targets were selected based on the overlap between LXWHT-related targets and predicted rosacea targets. Based on the H-C-T network topology analysis, we identified several core compounds, including quercetin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, luteolin, beta-carotene, baicalein, acetin, and isorhamnetin. Rosacea is a type of inflammatory disease, and many of these identified compounds are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory properties. For example, quercetin, a flavonoid that acts on multiple targets to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects, After identifying 28 potential targets of LXWHT in the treatment of rosacea, a PPI network was constructed and topologically analyzed using CytoHubba. The top 10 targets ranked under each calculation method were selected, and 5 core targets were identified based on the intersection analysis, including  The results of the GO enrichment analysis of the core targets supported their involvement in anti-inflammatory, vascular remodeling, and immune regulatory pathways. In terms of the BP category, enrichment was mainly observed in the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, transporter activity, nitric oxide synthase biosynthetic processes, negative regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, and granulocyte-neutrophil chemotactic migration, among others, suggesting that LXWHT may affect immune responses by interfering with the function and migration of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Nitric oxide biosynthetic processes are part of a classical pathway associated with vasodilator-related processes, which were also enriched, suggesting a potential mode of action of LXWHT. For the core targets in the KEGG analysis, enrichment was mainly observed in the TNF and  Ultimately, the topological analysis of the H-C-T network led to the identification of 5 hub genes ( Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrate that LXWHT, a formulation used in traditional Chinese medicine, may have potential advantages in the treatment of rosacea owing to its anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. However, further in-depth pharmacodynamic studies and molecular mechanism experiments are required to explore the full potential of LXWHT in the clinical treatment of rosacea.","['Liang Xue Wu Hua Tang', 'molecular docking', 'network pharmacology', 'rosacea']",2024-6-28,Medicine,Chlamydia
11465698,Comparative study on the epidemiological characteristics and hazards of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus infections among elderly people,"To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and infections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses in hospitalized elderly patients with respiratory tract infections in Suzhou City, China, and to compare the differences in clinical characteristics and economic burden associated with these two infections. In this prospective study, pathogenetic testing and clinical data for hospitalized patients aged 60 years and older with respiratory tract infections were collected in five hospitals through stratified cluster sampling from December 2023 to May 2024. Comparative study on epidemic characteristics, clinical features and costs of cases who infected RSV alone and influenza alone were conducted. Among 1,894 cases included, the RSV positivity rate was 5.91% during the 2023–2024 winter-spring season, while the influenza positivity rate was 9.61%. RSV-B was the predominant subtype of RSV, and influenza A (primarily H3N2) was the dominant strain among the influenza-positive cases. Compared with cases infected influenza virus alone, those infected RSV alone had lower occurrence frequency of fever (18.8% vs. 35.7%,  During the winter and spring months, RSV is the second most common pathogen after influenza virus among older adults hospitalized for respiratory infections in Suzhou, China. Patients infected RSV are more likely to develop complications with lower respiratory tract infections and have higher medical costs than the influenza. RSV infection in the elderly should be emphasized, especially in female patients and diabetic patients. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12879-024-10048-1."," Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a syndrome characterized by fever, cough, sore throat, and other symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common pathogens [ Globally, the severity and disease burden of RSV in older adults can be comparable to that of influenza [ Therefore, this study conducted a 6-month pathogen surveillance of respiratory tract infections in the elderly in Suzhou City, China, to investigate the prevalence characteristics and proportion of RSV infections among the elderly, compare RSV and influenza virus infections in terms of clinical characteristics and disease burden, elucidate the hazards of RSV-associated respiratory infections on the health of the elderly population, and provide a basis for the development of RSV-associated preventive strategies. In this study, we collected clinical data from elderly patients aged 60 years and older who were hospitalized due to ARI at five hospitals in Suzhou City (Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, The People’s Hospital of SND, Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan) and conducted pathogenicity testing from December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024. The WHO and European case definitions of ARI for RSV infection surveillance were used: acute onset (within 10 days) with symptoms of respiratory infection (at least one symptom: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or runny nose) [ This study was a prospective, multicenter study employing stratified whole cluster sampling. Stratified sampling was conducted by county and district, involving 3 counties in Suzhou (Zhangjiagang City, Changshu City, and Kunshan City) and 2 districts (Wujiang and Huqiu). Hospital-level stratified sampling included 3 tertiary hospitals: Suzhou Ninth People’s Hospital, Zhangjiagang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and The First People’s Hospital of Kunshan; and 2 secondary hospitals: The People’s Hospital of SND and Suzhou Changshu Xinzhuang People’s Hospital. The sampled hospitals collected and sent samples for testing from all elderly patients hospitalized for acute respiratory infections. See Fig.  Flowchart of the study The study used a self-designed survey form to collect case information, including: (1) demographic information (age, gender); (2) clinical information: clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, date of admission, date of discharge, discharge diagnosis, and hospitalization costs; (3) patient outcomes: including whether the patient died during the hospitalization period, time of death, whether they were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and time of ICU admission; and (4) economic burden: including direct medical costs (comprehensive medical services, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and consumables), direct non-medical costs (transportation and escort costs), and indirect costs (lost labor costs due to patient and family accompaniment). These data were obtained through the hospital information system and patient questionnaires. The questionnaire was developed specifically for this study to assess the epidemiological characteristics, clinical characteristics and disease burden of RSV and influenza in older adults (see Supplementary Material 1 and Supplementary Material 2 for the English version). Respiratory samples (nasal swabs) were collected by local hospital professionals during the study participants’ visits to the clinic or hospitalization, following standard sampling procedures. The samples were placed in tubes containing viral sampling solution and stored in a refrigerator at 2–8℃ (for up to 48 h) or at -20℃ (for up to 1 week). Influenza Novel Coronavirus Respiratory 13 Pathogen Nucleic Acid Test Kit (Fluorescent PCR method) (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co., Ltd.) and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR were used to detect pathogens such as Respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus, Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), Human coronavirus (HCoV, Not including COVID-19), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Human bocavirus (HBoV), Enterovirus (EV), and other pathogens. RSV-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Detection of respiratory syncytial viruses A/B (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.). Similarly, Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped using the Duplex Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Kit for Rapid Subtyping of Human Influenza A Viruses (Beijing Zhuocheng Huisheng Biotechnology Co.). Excel 2019 software was used to summarize the data, and R 4.3.1 software was applied to process and analyze the data. The study subjects were divided into RSV single and influenza single infection groups for comparison. Continuous variables are presented in mean and standard deviation (SD) and compared by independent-samples t-test. Counting variables are presented in medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and analyzed by Nonparametric test. The chi-square ( From December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024, a total of 1,894 cases of respiratory infections were investigated among the elderly in Suzhou City, with 455 testing positive for pathogens, yielding a positivity rate of 24.0%. Of these, 409 were infected with one pathogen, 42 with two, and four with three. The five pathogens with the highest detection rates were influenza virus (9.61%, 182/1,894), RSV (5.91%, 112/1,894), HRV (3.12%, 59/1,894), SP (2.96%, 56/1,894), and HMVP (1.58%, 30/1,894) (see Fig.  Proportion of pathogenic infections and positive detection of common pathogens of respiratory tract infections among the elderly in Suzhou City, China Among influenza virus infections, single infection accounted for 86.3% (157/182), double infections for 12.1% (22/182), and multiple infections for 1.6% (3/182). For RSV infections, single infection comprised 85.7% (96/112), double infections 11.6% (13/112), and multiple infections 2.7% (3/112) (see Fig.  
 Types of Influenza and RSV infection, and pathogen typing in elderly people in Suzhou City, China Influenza positivity was highest in December and then showed a significant month-to-month decline ( 
 Distribution of the time of onset of RSV and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in older adults The patients in both groups were mainly concentrated in the age group of 70–79 years. The mean age of those infected with RSV alone was 75.4 ± 7.6 years, while that of those infected with influenza virus alone was 75.7 ± 8.1 years. RSV infections were 43.8% (42/96) in males and 56.2% (64/96) in females; influenza infections were 61.1% (96/157) in males and 38.9% (61/157) in females. The proportion of females infected with RSV was greater than that of influenza, and the difference was statistically significant ( Among the underlying diseases, 20.8% (20/96) of RSV-infected and 8.9% (14/157) of influenza-infected patients had diabetes, a difference that was statistically significant ( 
 Basic characteristics of cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)] *Using Fisher's exact probability method The most common symptoms of RSV infection in elderly patients infected with RSV alone at the time of admission were cough (96.9%), followed by sputum production (62.5%), dyspnea (29.2%), fever (18.8%), shortness of breath (18.8%), wheezing (15.6%), runny nose (11.5%), and sore throat (10.4%). The most common symptom of influenza virus infection was cough (94.3%), followed by sputum production (52.9%), fever (35.7%), dyspnea (24.2%), wheezing (21.7%), shortness of breath (14.6%), sore throat (14.0%), and runny nose (13.4%). The proportion of fever was lower in RSV-infected elderly patients (18.8%) compared to those with influenza virus infection (35.7%) ( Comparison of clinical characteristics of hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [n (%)] *Using Fisher's exact probability method There was no statistically significant difference between RSV-infected cases and those with influenza virus infection in terms of oxygen saturation, ICU admissions, days of hospitalization, and discharge outcomes (see Table  The direct medical costs were $996.2 (792.0-1324.7) for RSV-infected cases and $841.1(574.5-1335.9) for influenza virus-infected cases, which was statistically higher for RSV infection than for influenza virus infection ( Comparison of hospitalization costs for hospitalized cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus-associated respiratory infections in the elderly [M(IQR), $] The total economic burden of RSV infection was higher than influenza virus infection ($1019.7 vs. $888.1), and the difference was statistically significant ( During the winter and spring seasons of 2023–2024, respiratory infections among older adults in Suzhou City, China, were predominantly caused by single-pathogen infections, with influenza virus being the most common. Influenza A was the main pathogen, with H3N2 identified as the dominant subtype. This aligns with findings by André Almeida et al., who reported H3N2 as the predominant influenza A subtype in elderly populations [ Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of corresponding NPIs, the rate of respiratory pathogen infections has been significantly impacted [ This study of respiratory pathogen surveillance in older adults over a 6-month period suggests that the health risks of RSV infection in this population cannot be ignored. Results from a population-wide ARI prospective surveillance in China, conducted from 2009 to 2019, showed that RSV ranked 5th among the 8 pathogens monitored, with a det ection rate of 7.4% [ Clinical symptom of RSV infection are similar to those of other viral respiratory pathogens and include cough (more than 90%), nasal congestion and runny nose (22-78%), sore throat (16-64%), and dyspnea (51-93%) [ An interesting finding in this study is that the proportion of females infected with RSV is higher than that of females infected with influenza. A related study indicated that the risk of RSV infection in females may be greater compared to influenza [ The study reported by Hakan Sivgin et al. revealed that heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes were the underlying conditions associated with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization, with all severe cases in their study involving patients with diabetes [ Our study found that the length of hospitalization for RSV was similar to that for influenza, consistent with previous research [ RSV can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly, potentially leading to respiratory failure and high mortality. Studies have shown that over 70% of RSV patients experience severe lower respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute bronchitis [ This study has several limitations. First, monitoring was conducted over a six-month period, and a full year of data collection has yet to be completed. Second, the study population included only individuals aged 60 years and older, excluding those under 60 years. We will continue monitoring to achieve a full year of surveillance and plan to conduct population-wide RSV surveillance in the future. The RSV epidemic in older adults in Suzhou City, China, occurs around the similar time as influenza and accounts for a significant proportion of respiratory infections in this population, with an economic burden comparable to that of influenza virus infection. RSV infections are more likely to lead to more serious lower respiratory complications than influenza infections. Therefore, establishing an RSV surveillance system should be prioritized to better monitor RSV infection in the elderly, particularly those with underlying conditions.

11464204,Understanding the influence of the microbiome on childhood infections,"The microbiome is known to have a substantial impact on human health and disease. However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.","The human microbiota is comprised of trillions of microbes – including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea – that have co-evolved with our species for millennia. The number of microbes colonizing our bodies is truly staggering; for instance, infants have an estimated 1.9 trillion human cells but are colonized by more than twice that number of microbial cells, including approximately 4.4 trillion bacterial cells [ At no point across the lifespan is the microbiome as dynamic as during childhood. At birth, infants are colonized by trillions of pioneering microbes from the maternal vaginal, gut, and skin microbiota. Over the ensuing days and months, these microbial communities undergo substantial shifts in composition due to changes in the local microenvironment, environmental exposures, and microbial competition. For instance, shortly after birth, the gut is an aerobic environment typically containing high abundances of facultative anaerobes, including bacteria from the genera  Although recent studies suggest that host genetics influences the microbiota during childhood [ The comparatively few pediatric microbiome studies that have been conducted after infancy suggest that the microbiota continues to develop and mature in response to environmental exposures. In particular, increasing age has consistently been associated with changes in microbiota composition during toddlerhood. During the second and third years of life, the gut microbiota increases in diversity (number of species), and a gradual loss of  Other environmental factors have been associated with alterations to the microbiota during childhood. Among 33 Japanese children, those who attended daycare were less likely to have nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles dominated by the health-associated species  The human microbiota provides protection against infection by preventing colonization and invasion by exogenous pathogens. This important function of the microbiota, referred to as colonization resistance, occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including competition for nutritional sources, production of antimicrobial compounds, alterations of the local microenvironment, and modulation of host immune responses ( Early-life colonization of mucosal surfaces by microbes is critical to immune system development [ The human microbiota continues to modulate immune system function throughout the lifespan. In health, microbiome-host homeostasis is characterized by low levels of inflammation and immune cell recruitment sufficient to create a state that is primed to respond to potential pathogens [ The microbiota influences the development of host immune responses to pathogens through several mechanisms. Commensal microbes can induce host epithelial cells to secrete antimicrobial peptides that target specific pathogens, as well as other commensal species [ With advances in our knowledge of the factors that disrupt microbiome composition during childhood and the role that the microbiota plays in immune development, there has been substantial interest in identifying microbiome characteristics that are associated with infection susceptibility or severity ( Globally, acute respiratory infections cause more than 740,000 child deaths each year [ There are accumulating data that early-life infections alter microbiome composition or function, contributing to differences in colonization resistance and infection susceptibility later in childhood. In a longitudinal study of 114 healthy infants, de Steenhuijsen Piters and colleagues found that asymptomatic viral infections occurring in the first few months of life were associated with a strong upper respiratory mucosal interferon response that coincided with enrichment of the upper respiratory microbiota by genera containing common pathogens ( The severity of respiratory infections is also influenced by upper respiratory microbiota composition. A cross-sectional study of children and adolescents found that a microbiota profile dominated by the putatively beneficial bacterial genera  Substantial evidence links the gut microbiota to the risk of enteric infections and other infections arising from the gut.  Bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality among several vulnerable populations of children. Among premature infants, late-onset sepsis is frequently caused by gut-derived bacteria, and these infections are often preceded by loss of potentially beneficial species from the gut microbiota and an increase in the gut abundance of the BSI-causative strain [ The gut microbiota is also the major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microbes in human populations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, which theoretically enables detection of all antibiotic resistance genes present within a sample (referred to as the ‘resistome’), has substantially advanced our ability to study antibiotic resistance during childhood. Several studies of the gut resistome among children have demonstrated that acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurs early in life, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment or other recognized risk factors [ Adolescents account for more than half of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States [ The composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota has also been associated with the risk of HIV infection. Women with cervicovaginal microbiomes with low abundances of  The oral microbiome is integral to the pathogenesis of early childhood caries, a condition caused by specific bacteria in the supragingival plaque that create an acidic microenvironment that promotes tooth demineralization and decay. Higher abundances of  With accumulating evidence that the microbiota influences infection risk and severity, there has been substantial interest in the development of microbiome-targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of infections. Although most studies have been conducted in adults, several such interventions have been studied in infants and children. Because the gut microbiota is recognized to play a critical role in the development of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, there has long been interest in modifying the gut microbiota of premature infants through the administration of probiotics. A recent meta-analysis that included 106 randomized controlled trials of more than 25,000 infants concluded that multiple-strain probiotics, especially when combined with prebiotics, were associated with lower incidences of severe necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality, whereas single-strain probiotics combined with lactoferrin were most effective in lowering the incidence of sepsis [ Most studies of probiotics in older children have evaluated these products among children with acute diarrhea or for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or CDI. Probiotic trials conducted among children with diarrheal illnesses have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting modest benefit. For instance, in a study of a probiotic containing a strain of the yeast  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used in the management of recurrent CDI for nearly two decades, although use of this procedure in children has been limited until relatively recently. Fortunately, there have been several recent studies demonstrating that FMT is a safe and effective treatment for children with recurrent CDI. For instance, Nicholson and colleagues recently summarized outcomes of 372 patients aged 11 months to 23 years with recurrent CDI who underwent FMT at 18 pediatric health centers between 2004 and 2017 [ Phage therapy, in which viruses that target and kill bacteria (bacteriophages) are used for infection treatment, dates back more than a century; however, there has been renewed interest in phages as a result of rising antibiotic resistance. Few controlled trials of phage therapy have been conducted among children; most notably, a clinical trial of  Vaccines have contributed to an unprecedented reduction in child mortality over the past century and continue to prevent nearly 3 million child deaths each year [ Perhaps the most compelling data supporting an association between the gut microbiota and responses to childhood vaccines comes from experiments conducted in animal models. In a landmark study, Lynn and colleagues demonstrated that infant mice that were exposed to ampicillin and neomycin prior to receipt of inactivated or live vaccines developed inferior vaccine-induced antibody responses [ Findings from clinical studies of the impact of the gut microbiota on vaccine-induced immunity have demonstrated varied and often conflicting results ( With the recognition that the gut microbiota may influence immune responses to vaccination comes the possibility that targeted modification of the gut microbiota could promote vaccine-elicited immunity. In particular, there has been substantial interest in the use of probiotics as vaccine adjuvants. Isolauri and colleagues reported that oral administration of  In conclusion, the human microbiota undergoes marked shifts in composition during early life as a result of environmental exposures. During infancy, these microbes are essential to immune maturation, promoting the generation of protective immune responses to potential pathogens and the development of immune tolerance to commensal microbes and host antigens. Throughout childhood, the commensal microbiota influences the risk and severity of infections through a complex network of microbe–microbe and microbe–host interactions collectively referred to as colonization resistance. This important function of the microbiota influences the risk of many infectious diseases that are common among healthy children and adolescents, including acute respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sexually transmitted infections. Moreover, the microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of gut-derived BSIs among vulnerable groups of children, including premature infants and pediatric HCT recipients. Data from animal experiments and correlative human studies also suggest that the microbiota influences immune responses to childhood vaccines. Taken together, the studies highlighted in this review demonstrate the substantial influence of the microbiota on infectious diseases during childhood and the enormous potential of microbiome-based therapies to prevent or treat infections and promote vaccine-elicited immunity among children. Our understanding of the influence of the microbiota on childhood infections has advanced remarkably over the past several decades. However, several important gaps in knowledge remain. To date, we know surprisingly little regarding factors that shape microbial communities and their influence on infections outside of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts or in older children and adolescents. For instance, few prior studies have investigated the microbiota of the male reproductive tract and the extent to which it influences the transmission of STIs among adolescents. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of studies of the early life microbiome have focused solely on bacteria, effectively disregarding the potential impact of microbes from other kingdoms on childhood infections. Finally, there is growing recognition that the microbiome field needs to move beyond correlative studies in order to accelerate the development of microbiome-based interventions to prevent or treat infections and other diseases in children. One of the main challenges facing the field is translating what we have learned about the microbiome to develop effective diagnostics and therapeutics for childhood infections. Next-generation sequencing technologies have the potential to revolutionize our approach to diagnosing infections. Recently, several commercial laboratories have developed assays that enable detection of clinically relevant microbes in a variety of human samples with a short turnaround time, providing results that can be used to guide clinical decision-making. These sequencing technologies also have the potential to transform the field of infection prevention and control. Multilocus sequence typing, which involves sequencing of only a handful of microbial genes that typically represent less than 1% of the genome, remains a standard approach for the evaluation of healthcare-associated infection clusters [ Since November 2022, the first two microbiota-based human therapeutics for adults with recurrent  As sequencing technologies and analytic methods become increasingly high-throughput and accessible, we anticipate that the study of the child microbiome will advance in several ways over the next 5 years. First, there will be an increase in studies investigating the extent to which fungi, viruses, archaea, and protozoa influence childhood infections through both microbe-host and microbe–microbe interactions, including interspecies interactions spanning microbial kingdoms. Moreover, we will see a continued shift from simple correlative studies to translational studies that utilize novel experimental models or that integrate data on microbial gene expression, microbial and host metabolites, and host immune responses. Additionally, commercial next-generation sequencing assays will be further validated as diagnostic tools and incorporated into routine clinical practice. Eventually, in time, the pathways for regulatory review and approval will be updated to enable development of an increasingly broad range of microbiome-based therapies that reduce the burden of infectious diseases among children.","['Colonization resistance', 'gastrointestinal microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'pediatric infectious diseases', 'respiratory microbiota']",2024-4-12,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,Chlamydia

Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed antiretroviral therapy, myocardial infarction, and protease inhibitors, etc. Keyword cluster analysis obtained 13 categories, which were roughly divided into 3 themes: (1) cardiovascular disease that has occurred or may occur; (2) HIV acquisitions that have occurred; (3) risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The article obtained the hotspots and trends and provided references for subsequent research. Based on the keyword citation burst detection analysis, we speculated that heart failure, risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, infection, and association were the research hotspots in recent years, which had a certain predictive effect on the future research direction.","Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that severely impairs the function of the immune system. CD4 However, after searching various popular databases, we found considerable literature on the relationship between the risk of HIV/AIDS and CHD. Although some scholars have done literature review studies, Bibliometric analysis studies the relationship between scientific literature and citation. It evaluates the relationship between a scientific research output, influence and academic cooperation through mathematical, statistical methods and provides a scientific decision-making basis through data analysis. Bibliometric analysis studies help researchers understand the dynamics of the academic community and guide research direction and resource allocation. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database is an important database for obtaining global academic information. It contains all articles and citations from the vast majority of journals, ensuring the integrity and systematicity of research in terms of time and content. Therefore, this study intended to use CiteSpace to visually analyze the literature related to the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD in the WoSCC database to explore the main research content and track the research hotspots. Based on the data analysis findings in the literature, we analyze the development dynamics and research trends of HIV/AIDS and CHD correlation research in the international arena, in order to provide a reference for predicting the direction of further research on the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD and to promote the development of effective strategies for preventing and treating CHD in PLHIV. Our study used the most common and popular database for bibliometrics, the WoSCC database( The inclusion and exclusion of studies were based on the filters of the WoSCC database. The studies that met the following criteria included: (1) Articles published in the period from January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023; (2) Articles about HIV/AIDS and CHD; (3) Original articles; (4) Published in English. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Duplicate publications; (2) Proceeding paper, editorial material, meeting abstract, book chapters, letters, early access, correction, reprint, and other types. The following basic information was collected for each article: countries, institutions, journals, authors, references, and keywords. Keywords with the same meaning but in different styles were standardized: “coronary-artery disease” was replaced by “coronary heart disease,” and “human immunodeficiency viru” was replaced by “human immunodeficiency virus.” Two researchers strictly screened the literature by examining the abstract section according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The third researcher determined the contents with differences and uncertainties. All documents were imported into EndNote X9 for document de-duplication and management. The above plain text files were imported into CiteSpace 6.2.R4 software and VOSviewer v1.6.19 software. CiteSpace is an academic literature analysis tool with an advanced visualization feature, which has the advantage of in-depth mining of academic research. It is able to extract burst terms and reveal the hotspots, developments trends and evolutionary paths of academic research. Compared with CiteSpace, VOSviewer more intuitively displays the relationship between network data and realizes the purpose of speedily gaining a comprehensive picture of research topics. In the knowledge map generated by CiteSpace, research projects were presented, including countries, institutions, authors, keywords, etc. VOSviewer mapped the scientific network of co-citation analysis. Each research project represents a node. The larger the node, the larger the number of papers published, the number of citations, the frequency of occurrence, and other related indicators. The connection between the nodes represents the relationship of cooperation, co-occurrence, and citation. The network map analysis demonstrates the nodes’ research level and capabilities and shows the cooperative relationship between each node. The timezone shows research trends based on the network map in the form of a timeline. Reference co-citation cluster analysis reflected and summarized the main content of the research field. The research themes of HIV/AIDS and CHD are interpreted by co-occurrence analysis of keywords, cluster analysis of Ridgeline Plot, and emergence analysis over the past 30 years. The trend of literature publication in the past 30 years was plotted using Microsoft Excel 2019. All data were available on a public database. Therefore, permission was not required from the ethics committee.

From January 1, 1993, to October 1, 2023, a total of 988 institutions were involved in research on the association between HIV/AIDS and CHD. The number of papers published by scientific research institutions can represent their research ability and research level in this field. The top 15 universities or institutions in the number of publications are almost all in the United States, as shown in Table  Ranking of top15 universities and institutions of article numbers. We obtained 377 authors while selecting “Author” for the parameter of Node Types and set the G-index to 10. When selecting Authors with “a count ≥3,” which represents the number of published papers more than 3, we obtained a total of 134 authors.

This study conducts a literature search and statistical analysis on the WoSCC database on the correlation between HIV/AIDS and CHD. A total of 1144 relevant literature were obtained, to a certain extent, they reflect the research trends and hotspots in HIV/AIDS and CHD. This research field primarily focuses on the cardiovascular diseases that have occurred or may occur in PLHIV, the existing late-stage HIV infection, and the influencing factors of cardiovascular diseases, etc, which indicates that this research field is popular in the era of CHD. According to the distribution map of the 30-year publication trend, the number of papers published increased rapidly from 1993 and peaked in 2012. The number of papers published fluctuated up and down around a stable value between 2012 and 2023. Accompanying the increase in ART coverage and the decline in mortality from HIV-related illnesses, non-HIV-related illnesses, mainly CHD, have gradually become the leading cause of death among PLHIV. The number of publications and citations of research results reflect the scientific research strength and depth of different countries, institutions and universities. In terms of the number of publications, the United States has an absolute advantage. Ranking each research institution and university according to the number of publications, the University of California System has the largest number of publications, followed by Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University. As the top 10 research institutions and universities are all from the United States, it indicates that the United States has far more research investment in this field than other countries. The scientific research strength and economic capacity of the United States are relatively strong. In terms of the average citations of the articles, Denmark is the most prominent, which may be related to the 3 highly cited articles by the author Friis-Moller, N. The timezone map is drawn with the authors’ appearance time and published papers, hence it can reflect the changing trend of the research field. Mapping based on the timing of the first publication and the number of publications by the authors revealed a small break in 2004, which is consistent with our publication trend map. Around 2012, the first appearance rate of authors in this field exploded, which indicating that they laid a solid foundation for the development of research in the next 10 years. Grinspoon, Steven K and his team have the greatest number of publications. They suggest that PLHIV on long-term combination antiretroviral therapy, especially protease inhibitors, have an increased incidence of myocardial infarction, even if treatment of PLHIV is more important than the risk of myocardial infarction. Friis-Moller, N and his group have the highest time cited. Among the first 10 articles, the Friis-Moller, N team occupied 3 articles, namely the first article, Keywords reflect the core research content of academic papers, and high-frequency keywords can reflect the research hotspots and trend evolution in this field. Therefore, keyword analysis is the most essential part of literature analysis. Keyword co-occurrence analysis was used to analyze the hot research directions in the field of HIV/AIDS and CHD in the past few years and reflected the current or future research hotspots and trends. By combining with the results of keyword burst detection analysis, it is reasonable to infer that the current research hotspots are heart failure, risk factors, subclinical atherosclerosis, and association. Heart failure is the most serious manifestation of CHD. An increasing number of studies have proved that HIV is an important factor in expanding the incidence of heart failure, In addition, through the cluster analysis of keywords, we obtained 13 categories. This study generalizes and summarizes the clustering results, which can be divided into 3 themes. The first theme is cardiovascular disease that has arisen or may occur. PLHIV have a higher risk of these diseases than people without HIV. Table  Cluster analysis of keywords and top 5 keywords in the 13 clusters. Similar to other bibliometric articles, there are 3 limitations of this study: the first one is that only the WoSCC database was used; the second one is the language was limited to English; the third one is article type was limited to the article, which may lead to missing data in some literature. In addition, some authors’ institutions and universities may have changed, resulting in the dispersion of research results, which may have affected the analysis results to some extent. Future research can further expand the database. Based on 2 bibliometric analysis tools, CiteSpace and VOSviewer, this study explored the relationship between HIV/AIDS and CHD. We analyzed and summarized this research topic’s development process and hot trends. In recent years, HIV/AIDS has become a global public health problem, and CHD-related diseases are the critical factors in the death of PLHIV. We thank Peking University, The Sixth People Hospital of Zhengzhou, and ZaiShuiYiFang Smart Technology Limited Company for supporting our research.","['AIDS', 'bibliometric analysis', 'citeSpace', 'coronary heart disease', 'HIV', 'research hotspots']",2024-10-04,Medicine,Chlamydia
11459521,Excessive or sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress: one of the culprits of adipocyte dysfunction in obesity,"As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise globally, the research on adipocytes has attracted more and more attention. In the presence of nutrient overload, adipocytes are exposed to pressures such as hypoxia, inflammation, mechanical stress, metabolite, and oxidative stress that can lead to organelle dysfunction. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a vital organelle for sensing cellular pressure, and its homeostasis is essential for maintaining adipocyte function. Under conditions of excess nutrition, ER stress (ERS) will be triggered by the gathering of abnormally folded proteins in the ER lumen, resulting in the activation of a signaling response known as the unfolded protein responses (UPRs), which is a response system to relieve ERS and restore ER homeostasis. However, if the UPRs fail to rescue ER homeostasis, ERS will activate pathways to damage cells. Studies have shown a role for disturbed activation of adipocyte ERS in the pathophysiology of obesity and its complications. Prolonged or excessive ERS in adipocytes can aggravate lipolysis, insulin resistance, and apoptosis and affect the bioactive molecule production. In addition, ERS also impacts the expression of some important genes. In view of the fact that ERS influences adipocyte function through various mechanisms, targeting ERS may be a viable strategy to treat obesity. This article summarizes the effects of ERS on adipocytes during obesity.","Obesity is one of the most prevalent health issues in modern society, which places a heavy burden on society. The main feature of obesity is the expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) accompanied by dysfunction, which is caused by a long-term imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. WAT is a major storage for excess energy and an endocrine organ, containing subcutaneous fat and visceral fat. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle that has the function of synthesizing, folding, and transporting proteins, as well as being responsible for lipid synthesis and calcium homeostasis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and excessive metabolites such as free fatty acid (FFA) derived from WAT enter the bloodstream and flow to other organs, bringing about metabolic damage to tissues and eventually progressing to various complications, such as NAFLD, cardiovascular diseases, and T2DM. During obesity, the inflammatory response of adipocytes is dependent or independent of ERS. Inflammation, ERS, and lipolysis in adipocytes can form malignant interactions. The inflammatory response is the downstream of ERS. Inflammatory cytokines can exacerbate ERS and promote adipocyte lipolysis, releasing excessive FFA, which in turn enhances adipocyte inflammatory response and ERS, starting a vicious cycle. The ER is rich in chaperones and oxidoreductases that control proper protein folding and ER-related degradation of abnormally folded proteins. The lipotoxic of FFA and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt the redox state of the ER, increasing the frequency of abnormally folded proteins. Human, mouse or cell models of ERS-related lipolysis. ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum stress. ERS has been considered an important mechanism of obesity-related IR. GLUT4 is an insulin-responsive glucose transporter. When insulin binds to its receptor, it starts a series of events that cause GLUT4 to transfer from the intracellular chamber and insert into the plasma membrane. Except for storing excess energy, WAT is also an active endocrine tissue that secretes bioactive molecules, including unique adipokines and conventional cytokines. Secretory profile of hypertrophic adipocytes is shifted toward the pro-inflammatory spectrum. Effect of ERS on the expression of bioactive molecules. ERS, Endoplasmic reticulum stress. Apart from adipokines, ERS alters the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes during obesity. ERS is associated with adipocyte apoptosis. Huang et al. reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) induced apoptosis of grass carp adipocytes through ERS, and B-cell lymphoma-2-related ovarian killer (BOK) may be an important link between ERS and apoptosis. BOK is considered to be a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, handling the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. DHA significantly increased the transcript of BOK, which was blocked by the ERS inhibitor. There is a cross-talk between the ER and mitochondria, which are closely linked both physically and functionally. ERS adjusts the expression of some important genes in adipocytes. PPARα is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that regulates genes associated with lipid metabolism, and PPARα expression is reduced in WAT of obese mice. Inhibiting ERS could be a therapeutic intervention against the morphological and functional alterations of overall adipose tissue depots in obesity. The ERS inhibitor TUDCA, as a bile acid conjugated to taurine with chemical chaperone activity, has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to minimize obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction and metabolic disorders. TUDCA has been approved by the US administration for clinical application of cholelithiasis and cholestatic liver disease. Thus, TUDCA treatment may also be a feasible therapeutic agent for obesity management. Since ERS in adipose tissue is primarily afflicted by obesity, the development of novel treatments for obesity may provide new insights into mitigating ERS. Although pharmacological inhibitors of ERS have therapeutic potential as new targets for metabolic diseases, obesity is adjusted by multiple factors and variables, making it a highly complicated disease for which a single therapeutic approach is usually less effective. The current lifestyle management strategies such as caloric restriction and physical activity are often inadequate. In addition to lifestyle changes, treatments for obesity generally include pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. On a global scale, the gradual increase in the prevalence of obesity over the past several decades is regarded as a serious threat to public health. The rising obesity epidemic and its related complications have made adipocytes an important topic of scientific research and a target for therapeutic intervention. The ER controls the correct folding of peptides and proteins through a variety of chaperones and enzymes on its membrane. When the overloaded protein folding exceeds the processing capacity, the ER folding process will be disordered, leading to the accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and ultimately triggering ERS. With the progression of obesity, excessive or sustained ERS disrupts adipocyte functions, including lipolysis, IR, apoptosis, bioactive molecule production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impacting the expression of some important genes, thereby affecting WAT ( The effects of ERS on the hypertrophic adipocyte.

11457904,Self-reported sexually transmitted infections and associated risk factors among female university students,"The spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is an ongoing public health challenge, and awareness of risk factors is essential for designing effective preventive interventions. This study aimed to assess self-reported STI occurrences and identify risk factors and sexual behaviors associated with STIs among female university students. This is a cross-sectional, online questionnaire study, including 384 female university students seeking contraceptive counseling at a gynecology clinic in Uppsala, Sweden, and reporting having had sex. Associated risk factors and behaviors were assessed by comparing those who reported STIs and those who did not. The mean age of participants was 22.8 years. Seventy-eight (20%) had contracted at least one STI, with seven (9%) experiencing multiple infections. Seventy-three (94%) reported first-date sexual activity without a condom among STI experienced. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most common STI pathogen (68% of all infections), followed by Herpes simplex virus (18%) and Mycoplasma genitalium (13%). Behavioral factors associated with self-reported STIs were first-date sexual activity without a condom, not using condom at first intercourse, younger age at first intercourse, a higher number of sexual partners overall and in the last 12 months, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regretting sexual activity after substance use ( Condom use was low among the respondents, and STIs were common regardless of the high level of education in this group. Contraceptive counseling needs to highlight the importance of condom use in addition to contraceptive efficacy. It is also essential to consider the specific risk factors and behaviors prevalent among young adults to reduce the spread of STIs.","Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a common problem worldwide and present various challenges regarding diagnostics, treatment, and prevention in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Most STIs are not life-threatening, but they can still lead to complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and fetal and neonatal morbidity ( University students can be considered especially vulnerable to contracting an STI, as partying, including binge drinking and recreational drug use, is a common and normalized behavior in campus culture ( Studies about sexual behavior and the use of contraceptives among female university students in Uppsala have been conducted regularly since 1989 ( Uppsala is a Swedish university city with about 50,000 students. Swedish-speaking women who visited an outpatient gynecology clinic for contraceptive counseling were asked to participate. Data collection took place between February and June 2023. Previously, only university students could visit this clinic, which was designated as the student healthcare clinic. From 2014 onward, it became open to all women. When attending the clinic, women were invited to participate and received information about the study along with a QR link to the survey. The survey was conducted via REDCap ( No ethical permission was needed since the study participants were anonymous, and no sensitive personal information could be linked to any individual (advisory opinion, Swedish Ethical Review Authority, dnr 219-04587). Since this was a follow-up study, the questionnaire was mostly identical to those used in previous studies ( Statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 29.0.2.0) and R (version 4.2.3). Continuous and discrete variables were analyzed using T-test for normally distributed data and Mann-Whitney U-test for skewed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test when there were too few observations for Pearson’s chi-square test. Proportions of STIs are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Clopper-Pearsons exact CIs. Due to the exploratory nature of the study and testing multiple characteristics, we set the level of statistical significance at 0.003 in accordance with the Bonferroni correction method (0.05/20 = 0.0025 ≈ 0.003). In total, 599 persons answered the questionnaire. As this study focuses on university students, those who stated that they worked, went to upper secondary school, or did not answer the question about occupation were excluded from further analyses. In addition, we only included participants reporting having had sex. Thus, 384 women studying at the university remained, and the background characteristics of these are presented in  Background characteristics of study participants ( Out of the 384 study participants, 78 (20%, 95% CI 16.4 – 24.7%) had experienced at least one STI, and seven (9%, 95% CI 3.7 – 17.6%) of them reported a history of more than one STI. Chlamydia trachomatis was the most commonly occurring STI; see  Self-reported STI pathogens among female university students ( The percentage of STI pathogens adds up to 106.3% because seven females reported more than one pathogen Characteristics and sexual behavior related to STI status among female university students. Among those who reported having had anal sex ( Comparison of those who have had an STI with those who have not T-test, Pearson’s chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s exact test Of the respondents, 20% had experienced an STI, and 9% of these had experienced multiple STIs. Both of these estimates were nominally lower than in the previous survey from 2014, when 26% reported one STI and 17% of these reported multiple STIs ( It is possible that the tendency toward a reduction in STI occurrence can be partly explained by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Sweden, the Public Health Agency issued recommendations such as limiting close contacts and keeping a distance from others to limit the spread of the virus ( A significant difference in the number of sexual partners was observed between women with and without experience of an STI, with more sexual partners in the STI group, in line with previous studies ( Dating app usage and meeting sexual partners online have been associated with sexual risk behavior ( Among those who reported experiencing an STI, it was more than twice as common to report having ‘regretted sexual activity after substance use’ compared to those without STI experience. Finally, considering the risk of contracting an STI, it is worrying that more than half of all students and almost all the students in the STI group have experienced first-date sexual activity without a condom. As recruitment took place at a gynecology clinic, our study does not capture those using only condom and hence not needing an appointment to obtain a prescription. This might affect the low rate of condom use. However, condom use is always recommended with new partners despite the use of other contraceptives. It cannot be excluded that the low numbers are also affected by impaired judgment due to alcohol consumption, as one-night stands often occur after a night out. However, non-use of condom was not statistically significantly associated with STIs in all situations. This suggests that other risk behaviors besides sex without a condom are more important for STI risk, as one can behave responsibly, for example, by getting tested before having sex with a new partner and therefore not using a condom. With its cross-sectional design, this study only provides information on associations between known variables. Nonetheless, it is a good-sized sample from a clearly defined population and offers valuable insights into factors associated with STIs among university students. We also set a conservative significance level, safeguarding against false positives and overinterpretation of the results. Additionally, the high internal response rate further strengthens the study. All recruited participants attended the same gynecological clinic, which may indicate a certain sociodemographic group and cause selection bias. On the other hand, the clinic’s central location and popularity among students facilitated effective recruitment. Condom-only users rarely visit a clinic for contraceptive counseling, which may also contribute to selection bias. Participation in the study was anonymous, which we considered important to minimize the risk of social desirability bias, as most of the questions were on sensitive topics. A potential downside of anonymity is that we could not examine the representativeness of the sample, and there is a risk of non-response bias if those who declined participation represent a specific group. Furthermore, all the data collected were self-reported retrospectively, making recall bias likely to some extent since a person’s ability to accurately recall past events deteriorates with time. The reliability of self-reported diagnoses depends on many factors, including the type of condition, question design, and participant understanding. With self-reported diagnoses, it is impossible to know if the person truly had the disease and had it verified by healthcare professionals or merely self-diagnosed. Particularly in the case of STIs, which carry stigma, accurate reporting may be further compromised. Altogether, this might contribute to an underestimated STI occurrence. This study’s findings contribute to the existing literature on STIs and sexual risk behaviors, which is crucial for designing preventive measures and promoting sexual health among young adults. Despite efforts to prevent STIs, poor condom use remains a persistent problem, especially among dating app users and those under the influence of alcohol. While this study does not delve into the reasons behind the lack of condom use, further research in this area is essential to identify specific barriers and develop targeted interventions. Future studies should continue to monitor STI occurrence beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, as the digital age and widespread use of dating apps may change people’s sexual habits and behaviors. The identified risk factors and behaviors for contracting an STI included younger age at first intercourse, a greater number of sexual partners, not using condom at first intercourse, first-date sexual activity without a condom, experience of anal sex, dating app usage, and regret of sexual activity after substance use. Despite the high level of education in this group, there was a worrying occurrence of STIs and a lack of condom use, especially under the influence of alcohol. These risk factors and behaviors should be considered when planning prevention efforts in this demographic group, and continuous promotion of condom use should be prioritized, especially in a risk context.","['Sexually transmitted diseases', 'sexual behavior', 'unsafe sex', 'sexual health', 'young adult']",2024-9-30,Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences,Chlamydia
11457556,"Experiences of harm and mental ill-health among gay, bisexual and other men-who-have-sex-with-men who use methamphetamine or GHB/GBL in different combinations: findings from the COMeT study in Taiwan","Polydrug use in the context of chemsex is commonplace among gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM). This study aimed to examine the differences in experiences of physical, social, and psychological harms, as well as mental ill-health among GBMSM who use different combinations of methamphetamine and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL) during chemsex. Adult GBMSM participants who had experience of chemsex in the past 12 months participated in a cross-sectional online survey in Taiwan and self-reported their sociodemographic background, sexual behaviours, mental health, and experiences of harm following a chemsex session. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess the different experiences of harm and mental ill-health among GBMSM who engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and who used both drugs. Out of 510 participants who completed all items included in the analysis, 24.1% engaged in chemsex without using methamphetamine, 36.9% used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL, and 39.0% used both drugs. Eighty five percent of men who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL reported at least one kind of social harm after a chemsex session, such as missing dates or appointments, or appearing “high” at work, followed by used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL (69.7%) and those without using methamphetamine (37.4%). After controlling for polydrug and frequency of drug use in the multivariable logistic regression, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing physical and psychological harms compared to those who did not use methamphetamine ( GBMSM who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in a chemsex context were more likely to report experience of harms than those who only used a single chemsex drug or engaged in chemsex without methamphetamine or GHB/GBL. Harm reduction should focus on both preventing HIV and STI transmission and on minimising psychosocial harm to GBMSM, with varying impacts depending on drug use.","Chemsex is a form of sexualized drug use, broadly defined by the use of methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid/gamma-butyrolactone (GHB/GBL), or mephedrone during or before sexual activities to enhance sexual pleasure or performance in gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM) [ Most studies have taken a broad approach to examining chemsex practices, often analyzing drug use as a single group without adequately exploring individual substances or focusing solely on polydrug use without examining potential synergistic interactions. Some studies have focused on only a single chemsex drug, such as methamphetamine or GHB/GBL [ Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL act differently upon the central nervous system (CNS) and can be associated with different harms, possibly due to their pharmacological properties [ Given the different characteristics of methamphetamine and GHB/GBL, as outlined above, it is necessary to separately examine the association of these two main drugs of chemsex with mental health and harms. This paper examines the following: (1) differences in the sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviours, and reported STI diagnoses, and (2) differences in physical, social, and psychological experiences of harm associated with chemsex for GBMSM who use GHB/GBL and/or methamphetamine. The Chemsex Online Survey for Men who Have Sex with Men in Taiwan (COMeT) was an anonymous cross-sectional online study that investigated the characteristics of harm in chemsex scenarios among GBMSM in Taiwan [ All participants reported whether they had engaged in chemsex or sexualized-related drug use in the past 6 months with any of the following substances: MDMA, prescribed sedative drugs (such as Stilnox), amyl nitrite, erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs, ketamine, methamphetamine, 5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (5-meo), alcohol, marijuana, mephedrone, GHB/GBL, cocaine, and “coffee-pack” (a pack of mixed substances with unknown ingredients). Participants were originally categorised into four groups based on their use (+) or not use (−) of methamphetamine (M) and/or GHB/GBL (G) in the past 6 months: M−G−, M−G+, M+G− and M+G+. Given that the proportion of M﻿−G+ participants ( Polydrug use was defined as the use of drugs excluding methamphetamine, GHB/GBL, alcohol, and ED drugs from the list of drugs in the survey. Methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were excluded due to multicollinearity. The frequency of using methamphetamine or GHB/GBL was assessed in separate questions by asking how often they used methamphetamine or GHB/GBL on a nine-point Likert scale from “daily” to “never.” We included age (20–29, 30–39, and > 39 years old), education (college or below, college graduate, and above college), and monthly income (< 15 kilos [K] New Taiwan dollars [NTD], 15–30 K NTD, and > 30 K NTD; 1 United States dollar [USD] ≅ 30 NTD). We asked each participant to report the number of sexual partners they had in the previous 12 months and categorised them as < 3, 3–5, 6–9, or > 9 partners. We also asked about their frequency of using condoms in a chemsex context in the past three months and categorised them as inconsistent (i.e., not always) and consistent (i.e., always). We combined the self-reported status of HIV and PrEP uptake in the past three months in a single variable and categorised it as HIV negative on PrEP, HIV negative but not on PrEP, and HIV positive. Self-reported STIs in the past 12 months, including gonorrhea, syphilis, anal and penile warts, genital herpes, amoebic colitis, chlamydia, shigellosis, and hepatitis virus infection (including type A, B, and C virus) were categorised into none and any. All participants were asked whether they had experienced a range of issues following a chemsex session and were presented with a 17-item checklist. Items were categorised into physical (such as eating problems or missing PrEP or HIV drugs), social (such as having difficulty getting out of bed or absence from work, etc.), and psychological (such as auditory hallucination or paranoid, etc.) experiences. We included four indicators of mental health: mood-related problems, suicide ideation, loneliness, and sexual well-being. Mood-related problems was measured by the Taiwan version of the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5, Cronbach’s alpha: 0.77–0.90) on a scale of 0–4 [ We conducted chi-square tests for descriptive statistics (including frequencies and proportions) to compare different mixed drugs groups (M−, M+G−, and M+G+) on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, the status of STIs, experiences of harm after a chemsex session and mental health. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations among different mixed drug groups and experiences of harm after a chemsex session. We set the alpha level at 0.05 and adjusted the alpha level for the multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni’s method (altered alpha level = original alpha divided by the number of dependent variables). All data were analysed by Intercooled STATA software version 15.0 (College Station, TX). A total of 918 participants met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the online survey, we deleted duplicated answers ( The sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, HIV status, and STIs among different GBMSM chemsex groups HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; STIs, sexually transmitted infections; GBMSM, gay, bisexual, and other men-who-have-sex-with-men; M−, chemsex individuals who did not use methamphetamine in the past six months; M+G−, chemsex individuals who use methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL in the past six months; M+G+, chemsex individuals who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL in the past six months; NTD, New Taiwan Dollar; K, kilo dollar; PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis The three groups showed a significant difference in sexual behaviour and in terms of reported HIV status or experience of STI diagnosis ( Half of the participants were living with diagnosed HIV (50.0%), 12% were HIV negative on PrEP, and 38% were not on PrEP. The M+G+ group included the highest proportion of people living with HIV (61.8% compared with 26.0% in M﻿− and 53.2% in M+G−) and the highest proportion on PrEP (15.1% compared with 12.2% in M− and 8.5% in M+G−). Nearly half of the participants (44.7%) had experienced at least one STI diagnosis in the last 12 months, excluding HIV (M+G+: 59.3%, M+G−: 44.7%, and M﻿−: 21.1%).

Even though suicidal ideation and mood-related problems were significant in univariable analysis comparing M+G+ and M−, they were not significant in Models 2 and 3 when polydrug use and frequency were further adjusted (see Table  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to distinguish and compare the profile of harm and mental health among GBMSM who engage in mixed patterns of chemsex drug use (i.e., methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL). The users of methamphetamine and/or GHB/GBL showed no difference in their sociodemographic characteristics but there were differences in sexual behaviour, HIV status, and the recent diagnosis of an STI. Even after controlling for polydrug, frequency of drug use, and other potentially confounding variables, those who used methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL and those who used both drugs were more likely to report experiencing different categories of harm compared to those who did not use methamphetamine. Mental health, loneliness, suicidal ideation and sexual well-being were not different among the three drug combination groups in multivariable analysis. GBMSM in the M+G+ group were most likely to report almost all kinds of harm following a chemsex session. Moreover, the risk of experiencing every kind of harm followed a decreasing gradient from GBMSM in the M+G+, M+G−, and M− groups. Our findings revealed that people who used both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL were most likely to report nearly every kind of harm after a chemsex session. Studies have found that the simultaneous use of drugs with opposite mechanisms (i.e., using CNS stimulant with CNS depressant) was associated with more toxic drug interactions than using a single drug, such as using ketamine with caffeine, using cocaine with alcohol, or using cocaine with heroin (also known as “Speedball”) [ It is worth noting that we found significant differences between M+G+ and M− in each type of harm after we further controlled for polydrug and frequency of using drug. This may reflect that beyond the effects of polydrug and frequency, the pattern of using drugs (i.e., using both methamphetamine and GHB/GBL) itself was still one of the important factors that was associated with different kinds of harm. On the other hand, the physical and psychological harm between M+G− and M− was still significant after controlling for polydrug and the frequency of using drug, but the social harm is no longer significant after controlling for the frequency. This may reflect that physical and psychological harm are related to the pattern of drug use (i.e., using methamphetamine but not GHB/GBL); however, social harm, which has a wider impact, may be partly explained by the frequency of using a drug rather than the type of drug use or polydrug. Although one study showed that polydrug and methamphetamine use were both associated with high risk of HIV infection and condomless sex [ Research has documented an association between the use of methamphetamine or GHB/GBL and condomless sex with nonsteady partners [ There were some limitations in this study. First, participants in this study were recruited through one specific popular app used by GBMSM in Taiwan. This might potentially lead to missing those who engaged in chemsex on other apps or channels. Second, our study sample included very few people of M−G+; however, this might reflect the actual situation of the Taiwanese GBMSM chemsex population. Since we merged M−G+ and M−G− into the M− group, it was hard to detect the distinct profile of harm experiences and mental health of those in the M−G+ group. Future studies may make extra effort to recruit more M−G+ users. Third, there might still exist some confounding variables that were not assessed in this study, such as participants' specific psychiatric diagnosis, which could affect their profiles on harm experiences and mental health. Fourth, we did not know for sure whether men were using the mixture of GHB and methamphetamine on the occasion that they experienced harms after the chemsex session. Future study should collect information at the event level and context of the chemsex. For example, a recent study found that in a cohort of young sexual minority men, same-day use of methamphetamine use was most commonly occurred with cannabis and GHB [ Research studies have rarely discussed the social harm following a chemsex session. Most studies about chemsex-related social harms have taken a relatively general, sociological, or macroscopic perspective and focused on the social stigma or damage to relationships [ Our study revealed that the profile of harm and mental health varied among groups of GBMSM who engaged in chemsex using different combinations of drugs. Typologies of drug use and mixed usage may be key factors differentiating the experience of harm and the interventions that are required to support GBMSM towards safer drug use.","['Gay-bisexual-and-other-men-who-have-sex-with-men (GBMSM)', 'Chemsex', 'Methamphetamine', 'Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)', 'Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)', 'Harm reduction']",2024-10-7,Harm Reduction Journal,Chlamydia

The patient exhibited a hyperinflammatory state following a urinary tract bacterial infection, with neurological function rapidly declining into a coma as the illness progressed. Gram culture of blood suggested  This case underscores the occurrence of ANE triggered by bacterial infection, expanding our understanding of the pathogens associated with this condition. It suggests that ANE may be an immune-mediated disorder rather than solely an infectious disease.","Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a distinct form of acute encephalopathy typically triggered by acute infections, predominantly viral in nature. ANE predominantly affects children under 6 years old. It is characterized by rapid neurological deterioration, presenting symptoms such as coma, seizures, or focal neurological deficits, typically within days of a preceding infection, without evidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection [ A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to a disturbance of consciousness following a fever. Upon admission, she was intubated and scored a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3/15 (E1V1M1). Initially, she experienced chills and fever, followed by two days of nausea and vomiting, along with dizziness, cyanosis, and impaired consciousness. No cough, hemoptysis, gastrocnemius tenderness, and conjunctival congestion was complained. She presented to the nearest hospital with a temperature of 41 °C and required emergency intubation to support her breathing. She has never experienced seizures.

11456218,Modulation of Inflammation in McCoy Cells by Zinc Nanoparticles Conjugated With β-Chitosan,"Introduction: This study investigated biosynthetically derived β-chitosan-derived zinc nanoparticles (β-Ch-Zn NPs) for their potential anti-inflammatory properties on McCoy cells. β-Ch-Zn NPs were synthesized using a green chemistry approach, and their characterization confirmed successful synthesis, appropriate size, and morphology. The study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs and their effects on inflammatory responses in McCoy cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: β-Ch-Zn NPs were synthesized and characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to confirm their structural and morphological properties. The cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at various concentrations to determine safe doses for subsequent experiments. To induce inflammation, McCoy cells were pretreated with β-Ch-Zn NPs at different concentrations before LPS stimulations. Gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of proinflammatory cytokine. Results: FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and XRD confirmed the successful synthesis of β-Ch-Zn NPs with the desired size and morphology. The MTT assay demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs, indicating safety for cellular studies. Pretreatment with β-Ch-Zn NPs significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines. The nanoparticles effectively downregulate proinflammatory cytokines and promote anti-inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by the significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, hypoxia-inducible factor, and nuclear factor kappa B expression in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects in McCoy cells. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of β-Ch-Zn NPs for treating inflammatory conditions and support further investigation into their in vivo efficacy and safety.","Inflammation is a fundamental biological response to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is a protective mechanism involving immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells, and establish tissue repair. While acute inflammation is crucial for healing and recovery, chronic inflammation is associated with various diseases, including arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, managing and controlling inflammation is crucial to treating these conditions. Recent advantages in nanotechnology have opened new avenues for developing innovative anti-inflammatory agents. In inflammatory diseases, nanoparticles can be descended to deliver unimplemented drugs directly to the affected tissues, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing systemic side effects. Additionally, nanoparticles can be engineered to modulate human responses. They can be cotton swabs infused with liquids that interact with specific receptors on immune cells, thereby influencing cell activation and cytokine release. This targeted approach can help control excessive inflammation and promote the resolution of chronic inflammatory conditions [ Incorporating metal nanoparticles, such as zinc, into β-chitosan matrices can further enhance its biological properties. Zinc is an essential trace element involved in numerous biological processes, including enzyme function, protein synthesis, and cell division. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have been extensively studied for their antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. ZnONPs have shown promise in modulating inflammatory responses, partly due to their ability to influence the production and activity of cytokines, which are key mediators of inflammation. Moreover, zinc's antioxidant properties help scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to exacerbate inflammatory responses [ Despite the promising potential of β-Ch-Zn NPs, several gaps remain in our understanding. While ZnONPs have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, the specific mechanisms through which β-Ch-Zn NPs exert these effects, particularly in an in vitro model, are not yet fully elucidated. Specifically, there is a need to explore how β-Ch-Zn NPs modulate proinflammatory cytokines, influence key signaling pathways involved in inflammation, and impact oxidative stress markers [ The cytotoxicity of β-Ch-Zn NPs will be evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which measures cell viability based on the reduction of a tetrazolium compound to formazan by metabolically active cells. This assay provides an initial assessment of the biocompatibility of the nanoparticles and helps to determine the appropriate concentration range for subsequent anti-inflammatory studies, ensuring that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic at the concentrations used for anti-inflammatory studies. Ensuring that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic at the concentrations used for anti-inflammatory assays is essential, as cell death could confound the results. To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of β-Ch-Zn NPs, McCoy cells will be stimulated with LPS to induce an inflammatory response [ Overall, this study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the anti-inflammatory potential of biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs on McCoy cells. By elucidating their effects on cytokine production, signaling pathways, and oxidative stress, the study seeks to establish β-Ch-Zn NPs as a promising therapeutic agent for managing inflammation. The findings from this study could pave the way for further research and development of β-Ch-Zn NPs for clinical applications in inflammatory diseases, contributing to the growing field of nanomedicine [ Green synthesis of β-Ch-Zn NPs To synthesize β-Ch-Zn NPs, a zinc ion solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 mM zinc nitrate in deionized water. A 0.1 mM β-chitosan solution was prepared separately. These solutions were mixed under constant stirring to ensure thorough homogenization. To initiate the formation of ZnONPs, a freshly prepared 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution was added dropwise to the mixture while stirring vigorously. Stirring continued for 30 minutes to complete the nanoparticle formation and stabilize the β-Ch-Zn NPs. The resulting nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes to separate the nanoparticles from unreacted materials and impurities. The supernatant was discarded, and the nanoparticles were washed multiple times with deionized water to remove residual reactants, ensuring the purity and stability of the synthesized β-Ch-Zn NPs [ Characterization of β-Ch-Zn NPs The biosynthetic approach for synthesizing β-Ch-Zn NPs was confirmed through various characterization techniques. FTIR spectroscopy revealed characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups of β-chitosan and zinc oxide. The presence of broad peaks around 3,420 cm Cell culture and treatment For the study, McCoy cells (procured from the National Centre for Cell Science, India) were selected and cultured in appropriate media supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics under standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO Cell viability assay: MTT assay The MTT assay evaluated the cytotoxic effects of β-Ch-Zn NPs on McCoy cells. The results demonstrated that β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibited efficacy on McCoy cells. For analyzing biocompatibility, different concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μg/mL) of conjugated nanoparticles were assessed. The cell viability was recorded. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control with the above-mentioned concentrations. From the biocompatibility testing, two concentrations were calculated based on the half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of the conjugated nanoparticles (33 and 66 μg/mL) for the gene expression analysis. The statistical significance was analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc test [ Gene expression analysis The expression levels of IL-2, IL-6, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and NF-κB were measured by qRT-PCR. McCoy cells were treated with β-Ch-Zn NPs (33 and 66 µg/mL) for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Gurugram, India). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primers used for amplification were as follows: Bax: forward 5'-TCCACCAAGAAGCTGAGCGAG-3', reverse 5'-GTCCAGCCCATGATGGTTCTG-3'; BCl-2: forward 5'-GGGAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTT-3', reverse 5'-TGAAGGAGCGCAACCGGA-3'; IL-2: forward 5'AGCAGCTGTTGATGGACCTACC-3', reverse 5'-AGTTGATGGACCTGGGAAAGG-3'; IL-6: forward 5'-CCAGGAGCCCAGCTATGAA-3', reverse 5'-CCAGGCAAGTCTCCTCATTGA-3'; TNF-α: forward 5'-GCCCAGACCCTCACACTCAG-3', reverse 5'-GCTACAGGCTTGTCACTCGG-3'. The relative expression levels of the target genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and calculated using the 2 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences between the groups were analyzed using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical significance was represented as follows: * represents p < 0.05 (statistically significant), ** represents p < 0.01 (highly statistically significant), and *** represents p < 0.001 (extremely statistically significant) [ This study synthesized β-chitosan-derived ZnONPs (β-Ch-ZnO-NPs), and their anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in McCoy cells. The analysis included the assessment of cell viability using MTT assay at different concentrations and expression of IL-2, IL-6, HIF, and NF-κB genes. UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis β-Ch-ZnO-NPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing a distinct exciton band observed at 301 nm, closely resembling the characteristic exciton absorption of ZnONPs (350-373 nm). The rapid increase in absorbance upon excitation from the nanoparticles' ground state to their excited state further confirmed their optical properties. However, a subsequent decrease in radiation absorption suggested some nanoparticle agglomeration. These results highlight the successful synthesis of β-Ch-ZnO-NPs and their promising optical characteristics for various applications (Figure  UV-Vis: ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles FTIR analysis FTIR analysis of biosynthesized β-Ch-ZnO-NPs was conducted to identify putative functional groups.

The output from XRD analysis of the as-prepared and annealed β-Ch-Zn O-NPs samples yields a plot of intensity versus angle of diffraction, as shown in Figure  XRD: X-ray diffraction; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles Effect of β-Ch-ZnO-NPs on cell viability The MTT assay evaluated the cytotoxicity of zinc nanoparticles conjugated with β-chitosan on McCoy cells. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of nanoparticles (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 μg/mL) for 24 hours. Doxorubicin was used as the positive control. The viability of untreated McCoy cells served as a control (100% viability). The results showed that doxorubicin and β-CT-ZnO NPs showed similar cytotoxic patterns on the treated cells. The cytotoxicity was concentration-dependent (Figure  The statistical significance was analyzed with the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (compared every concentration of the control group to each concentration of the treatment group).

The expression levels of key proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured using q RT-PCR. The results were normalized to β-actin expression and analyzed using the 2 IL-2 expression IL-2 is pivotal in immunotherapy by stimulating T-cell proliferation and activation, enhancing immune responses against cancer cells. Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed IL-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-Ch-Zn NPs reduced the IL-2 expression by twofold (Figure  The statistical significance was analyzed with the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test (comparing the control group to each treatment group).

Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed IL-6 expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-CT-ZnO NPs reduced the IL-6 expression by about 45%. This suppression indicates that β-CT-ZnO NPs can modulate the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the production of IL-6, thereby reducing inflammation (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation.

A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *p = 0.05: statistically significant; **p = 0.01: highly statistically significant IL-6: interleukin 6; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles Image credit: Meenakshi Sundaram K HIF expression HIF expression in cancer biology refers to the upregulation of these transcription factors in response to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) within tumors. This adaptive response promotes tumor survival, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy, making HIFs crucial targets for cancer treatment strategies. Treatment with β-CT-ZnO NPs significantly suppressed HIF expression in a dose-dependent manner. The highest concentration of β-Ch-Zn NPs reduced the HIF expression (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation. The statistical significance was analyzed using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. **p = 0.01: highly statistically significant; ***p = 0.008: extremely statistically significant HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor; β-Ch-ZnO-NPs: β-chitosan-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles Image credit: Meenakshi Sundaram K NF-κB expression The NF-κB pathway plays a central role in regulating the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines. LPS stimulation led to a significant increase in NF-κB expression in McCoy cells. However, β-Ch-Zn NPs treatment resulted in a substantial decrease in NF-κB expression. The reduction was most pronounced at 66 µg/mL, where NF-κB levels were lowered by approximately 50%. This suggests that β-CT-ZnO NPs can effectively inhibit the activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby attenuating the overall inflammatory response (Figure  The values were represented as mean ± standard deviation. The statistical significance was analyzed using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test.

LPS-induced inflammation in McCoy cells is a well-established model for studying inflammatory responses mimicking aspects of bacterial infection and inflammation. This discussion explores the potential of β-CT-ZnO NPs in modulating this inflammatory response, drawing on recent literature to provide a comprehensive analysis.  LPS-induced inflammation in McCoy cells is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well as oxidative stress and activation of NF-κB signaling pathways [  Recent literature indicated that β-chitosan in conjugated zinc nanoparticles can significantly modulate inflammatory responses. A study by β-chitosan coated ZnONPs demonstrated superior anti-inflammatory effects compared to free ZnONPs or β-chitosan alone. The authors attributed this to the enhanced cellular updates and targeted delivery of ZnONPs due to chitosan coatings [ The study demonstrates that biosynthetically derived β-Ch-Zn NPs exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effects on McCoy cells by modulating the expression of key cytokines and signaling pathways. These findings provide a strong foundation for further exploration of β-Ch-Zn NPs as potential therapeutic agents for managing inflammatory diseases. Further studies could focus on in vivo evaluations and the exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of these nanoparticles.","['cytokines', 'green synthesis', 'cytotoxicity', 'mccoy cells', 'anti-inflammatory', 'β-chitosan nanoparticles']",,Cureus,Chlamydia

 Response to reviewers 1. Reviewer #1: The authors have tried to annotate a list of uncharacterized proteins from Vibrio cholerae and analysed their potency for vaccine development. I find the work is very much useful for the scientific community. Author’s response: Thank you so much for your kind comment. 2. Reviewer #2: In the manuscript “Comprehensive in-silico analyses of fifty-one uncharacterized proteins from Vibrio cholerae"", submitted by Mallick et al., the authors present an intriguing study on the characterization of 51 uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins in Vibrio cholerae. The focus on understanding these proteins' physicochemical properties, functional associations, and potential roles is well-justified and contributes to the broader understanding of cholera biology. However, a few areas could be further developed to enhance the clarity and impact of the paper.  (A) The introduction could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the significance of these particular proteins. Providing a stronger rationale for their selection and discussing how this study advances our understanding of V. cholerae would help set the stage for your findings. Author’s response: The lines 58-67 (Page 2-3) have been modified. The following lines (highlighted in yellow) are added within the manuscript: - “Understanding these biochemically, structurally and functionally uncharacterized proteins can pave the way towards mechanistic insights of how this essential GTPase, CgtA, exerts its pleotropic effect. Hence, we carried out a comprehensive in silico analysis of these uncharacterized proteins, which allowed us to predict their physicochemical and immunogenic properties and hypothesize and design various in vitro and in vivo experiments to characterize these proteins, which will lead us to understand the basis of cholera pathogenesis at a deeper level. Also, we have successfully identified a number of potential drug-targets and vaccine candidates among those 51 uncharacterized proteins that will facilitate the production of various vaccine constructs and drugs through in vivo and in vitro experiments against the Vibrio cholerae pathogen.” (B) Your methodological approach is comprehensive, especially in describing the physicochemical properties of the proteins. However, it would be useful to elaborate on why these specific properties are important for studying hypothetical proteins. Additionally, more details on the tools and databases used for solubility predictions, subcellular localization, and domain identification would enhance reproducibility and transparency. Author’s response: Lines 115-136 (Page 4-5) have been modified to include more information as per the suggestion.  “The ProtParam web server by ExPASy ( Lines 143-145 (Page 5) were added to describe PSORTb tool which is used to predict subcellular localization of a protein.  “A score is assigned for every localization site which reflects the confidence level of the prediction. A score, higher than the cut-off value 7.5 indicates a strong confidence in the predicted localization.” We have also added a minor detail about the tool PSLPred in line 147-149 (Page 5). The following line was modified as follows: - “Further, the results were confirmed by PSLpred ( Lines 157-162 (Page 5-6) was modified and added in the manuscript file. The following lines were modified and added where we have described the tools used for domain identification. “The results generated by the “Interpro” database were validated using SMART ( (C) The use of STRING for predicting protein-protein interactions is a strong aspect of the study, but the manuscript could be improved by providing more insight into these predicted interactions. Discussing how these interactions contribute to understanding the proteins' potential functions would add depth to your analysis. Author’s response: Lines 386-397 (Page 13) were added to explain the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) derived from STRING version 11.5. The following lines were added in the manuscript: - “Identification of protein-protein interaction network Protein-protein interaction or PPI network for 51 uncharacterized proteins were visualized in STRING version 11.5, which predicts the interactive protein partners using a confidence score above 0.7. The interacting partners of each of the uncharacterized proteins are tabulated in Supplementary material 3, Table S15. The highest confidence score of 0.996 and 0.994 were observed for the interaction between SpoVR family protein, Q9KQX3 and a hypothetical protein, Q9KQX4 (VC_1873) and uncharacterized protein, Q9KQX5 (VC_1872) respectively. Other interaction with high confidence score of 0.993 was seen in PPI between EAL domain containing Q9KRD2 and Q9KPJ7 (Gene name- VC_2370) which is a sensory box containing diguanylate cyclase enzyme. The findings in this study will allow us to reinforce our understanding on the probable functions of these uncharacterized proteins and decipher the molecular pathways involved with cellular functions.” (D) The experimental validation of two proteins is a valuable part of the study, but it would be beneficial to expand on the results of these experiments. Discuss how the experimental findings align with or differ from your in-silico predictions, as this correlation could be a significant strength of the paper. Author’s response: Lines 428-443 (Page 14) were added where we have compared the predicted solubility and molecular weight of the selected proteins with the experimental results. The following lines were added (as highlighted in the manuscript):-  “The GRAVY index for Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 were predicted to be -0.172 and -0.319, respectively, which indicates their solubility in solution. Also, the predictions based on SOSUI and DeepTMHMM, the two proteins were predicted to be soluble. However, while expressing the proteins in the heterologous system of E. coli BL21 (pLySs) both the proteins showed solubility issues. We have used mild concentration (2M) of polar reagent, urea, to solubilize the inclusion body. The solubilized inclusion body were then purified using a nickel-NTA column. Finally, the expression of the purified protein Q9KRD2 (Figure 6G) and Q9KU58 (Figure 6I) were checked by SDS‒PAGE, respectively. The purified Q9KRD2 showed a clear band near 100 kDa protein marker and purified Q9KU58 showed a distinct band near 15 kDa band as expected from in silico analysis. Further, the expression of the two purified protein were validared western blot analysis (Figure 6H and J). The 3-dimensional model structure of Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 is shown in (Figure 6K and 6P). Ramachandran plot validation for the protein Q9KRD2 suggested that 91.70% the residues were seen to be in the most favoured region (Figure 6L and 6M) while for Q9KU58 79.30% (Figure 6Q and 6R). Additionally, ProSA z-score of Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 found as -13.31 (Figure 6N) and -2.66 (Figure 6S) respectively ProSA was also used for assessing local model quality of Q9KRD2 (Figure 6O) and Q9KU58 (Figure 6T).”  Other aspects such as domain characterization, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions and structure are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, we are currently exploring these aspects experimentally which we would like to present it in a separate manuscript. (E) In terms of structure, the manuscript could be improved with smoother transitions between sections, particularly when moving from computational analysis to experimental validation. This would help create a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, the conclusion could be expanded to emphasize the broader significance of your findings and suggest possible directions for future research. Author’s response: The “Result and discussion” part describing the structure of the 51 uncharacterized proteins, and the experimental validation of two proteins, Q9KRD2 and Q9KU58 by cloning and expression has been updated as shown by the highlighted region in page-13 and 14. We have also modified the conclusion as shown by the highlighted region in page 17-18 of manuscript file. Following is the conclusion that we have added in the manuscript. “Understanding the role of uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins in bacteria are essential for bridging the gaps in our knowledge of gene functions, interactions and molecular mechanisms leading to bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we analyzed 51 uncharacterized and hypothetical proteins of V. cholerae whose expression is altered in CgtA-depleted conditions, as shown by transcriptomic and proteomic studies. We determined the physicochemical properties of the strains, such as molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point, extinction coefficient, instability index, aliphatic index, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), and total number of negatively and positively charged residues. The molecular weight of the proteins ranged from 92 kDa to 5 kDa, and the theoretical pI ranged from 4.19 to 11.40, with the majority of the proteins being acidic. The theoretical pI is defined as the point at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge at the pH scale and is useful for understanding protein charge stability. We also computed the solubilities, subcellular localizations and probable functions of the proteins and identified their domains and families using various bioinformatics tools and databases. We have observed that several of these uncharacterized proteins are involved in essential cellular processes associated with cholera pathogenesis like transcription, translation, phosphorelay signal transduction, motility and chemotaxis. These predictions are very crucial and effective for hypothesis generation and designing experiments for further validation. For functional protein association networks, STRING was used for the prediction of interactions between our uncharacterized candidate proteins and other partners. Characterizing protein–protein interactions is vital to reinforce our understanding of protein function and the biology of the cell. Additionally, we employed reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic approach to identify potential vaccine candidates and potential drug targets that will pave the way towards novel drug discovery and vaccine design against cholera pathogen. We also constructed 2D and 3D structural models with PSIPRED and Alphafold2-mmseqs2 respectively, which were further validated with ProSA and PROCHECK. The in-silico studies were further validated by experimental studies by cloning and expression of two crucial proteins (potential vaccine candidates) whose expression was altered in CgtA-depleted conditions. The protein Q9KRD2 is a 92 kDa EAL and sensory PAS domain-containing putative phosphodiesterase that is downregulated when cgtA is knocked down in the V. cholerae genome. In contrast, proteomic studies have shown that the 12 kDa protein Q9KU58 is upregulated when cgtA is knocked down in the V. cholerae genome. Our findings based on in-depth quantitative computational analysis and experimental work will help us to understand the biology of cholera pathogenesis as a whole, and also identify potential therapeutic leads at the molecular level.” (F) The manuscript would benefit from grammatical revisions for clarity, and some technical terms should be defined more clearly for readers who may not be specialists in the field. Including figures or tables to summarize key findings, such as the physicochemical properties or interaction networks, would also enhance the readability and impact of the paper. Author’s response: The entire manuscript was checked in English language editing tool, viz., Grammarly and Curie, for the purpose of enhancement of clarity for readers. Furthermore, the result and discussion part, especially the reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic part have been explained in greater details for better clarity. The figure and table captions were also re-written elaborately. (G) Overall, the study presents valuable findings that contribute to the understanding of V. cholerae proteins but addressing these suggestions could strengthen the manuscript and make it more accessible and impactful. Author’s response: Thank you so much for your valuable input and suggestions. We tried our level best to respond to your insightful queries. Thank you. 3. Reviewer #3:  (A)Explanation needed to choose CgtA over another available drug targets. Author’s response:  Although CgtA is a multifunctional essential GTPase in Vibrio cholerare, not much is known about its mechanisms of actions. Hence our laboratory has been working on it to better understand its functionality and find new or alternate drug targets based on CgtA research in V. cholerare.  (B)Explain significance of predicted 20 drug targets. Author’s response: Virulent proteins play a monumental role in pathogenesis of infectious disease and can be targeted for drug-design and therapeutic interventions. 20 potential drug targets were predicted from a pool of 51 uncharacterized proteins based on assessment generated by VirulentPred which exploits 5 prediction approaches: -  (a) Amino acid composition,  (b) Dipeptide composition,  (c) PSI-BLAST generated PSSM profiles,  (d) A cascade of SVMs and PSI-BLAST, and  (e) Higher order dipeptide composition. The threshold value for each approach was taken as 0 (zero). A positive score indicates that the protein is virulent. Whereas, a negative value indicates that the protein is a non-virulent protein.

11451835,Epidemiology and Diagnostic Accuracy of Respiratory Pathogens in Pediatric Populations: Insights From Global Studies,"Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the most common cause for going to the doctor’s at pediatric age. Respiratory infections are still of interest because they are widespread, significantly impact public health by potentially leading to pandemics, drive antimicrobial resistance through antibiotic misuse, more often spread globally due to traveling, and benefit from ongoing advancements in diagnostics and research for better management. This paper’s main aim was to offer a systematic review of the literature published over the last 10 years on the etiology of LRTIs. The search strategy was based on reviewing original articles, systematic reviews, position papers, and guidelines published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed. The review was previously registered with PROSPERO. The final review included 27 articles that met the eligibility criteria (studies identifying the etiology of inferior respiratory infections in children, according to the WHO definition, published in the last 10 years). Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel Version 2406 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) and SPSS Statistics V.23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). The total number of patients was 2,193,978. Eight articles focused on children younger than five years, and two included children under the age of two. The results revealed that ","Although the causes of respiratory infections in children are generally known in theory, the subject is still of interest for scientists due to the imperfect ways of diagnosing and identifying the etiology, mainly because pneumonia remains the most frequent cause of death in children under five years old [ Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are defined as infections affecting the airways below the larynx or the pulmonary alveoli. They include bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. The symptoms are not specific, including fever, coughing, wheezing, difficulty or rapid breathing, and chest pain. The diagnosis is clinical, based on the physical examination on which rales or condensation are found, alongside changes in the pattern of breathing. In pneumonia, chest X-rays may help in making the difference between possible etiologies [ The aim of our paper is to identify studies on the etiology of LRTIs and perform a systematic review of the literature published over the last 10 years. Based on this information, our goal was to identify what are the possible causes of LRTIs and design a protocol of diagnosis based on clinical and biological tests that would reduce the anxiety of medical staff and parents, as well as cut down some costs of unnecessary testing, unneeded antibiotic use, and hospitalization. Our search strategy was based on reviewing original articles, systematic reviews, position papers, and guidelines published. We identified the review question, and we established the keywords for the search. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched. There was a language restriction applied: only full papers were available in English. After identifying the papers in full text, duplicates were removed, and inclusion criteria were applied. Inclusion criteria were settled: studies identifying the etiology of inferior respiratory infections in children, published in the last 10 years. We excluded all papers that did not have a full text available, including those that studied both inferior and superior respiratory infections, risk factors for infection, or associations with other pathologies such as asthma, tuberculosis, cancer, etc. For the remaining articles, we checked references for the other articles.  The population we targeted was formed out of children aged 0 to 18 years of age. LRTI was defined [ The studies were assessed regarding design, methodological quality, levels of evidence, and description. Reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). This tool was instrumental in identifying potential biases like selection or publication biases within the included studies. To mitigate these, we used comprehensive search strategies that included multiple databases and gray literature, like unpublished studies, conference abstracts, dissertations, and clinical trial registries. We applied clear and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We acknowledge the language bias. However, the included studies offer a global perspective on the subject. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklists were used for the validation of the studies included. The checklist contained ten questions that every article had to answer, regarding whether the aims were clearly stated, whether the qualitative methodology, the design of the research, the recruitment strategy, data collection, and data analysis were adequately formulated if the relationship between researcher and participants was taken into consideration, if there were ethical issues, if the findings were clearly stated, and how valuable the research is. The remaining 27 articles that met the CASP criteria and checked the PRISMA checklist were included.  This review was registered in the PROSPERO international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health in March 2022, with ID CRD42022309946. The literature screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with subsequent cross-checking to ensure accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, and if consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer was involved to mediate. The following data were collected: general information on the study-publishing date, geographical region of interest, number of patients included, means of testing for etiology, and findings regarding the etiology of infection. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel Version 2406 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) and SPSS Statistics V.23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to compare the efficacy of diagnostic tools. McNemar's test was used to compare paired proportions. Cohen's kappa statistic was applied to assess the agreement between diagnostic tools. Fisher's exact test was conducted to analyze the associations between clinical manifestations and etiological agents in co-infection studies.

From the 27 selected papers, two are epidemiological studies [ All selected papers met the definition for LRTIs [ The demographic characteristics of the study populations across the various articles provided insights into the prevalence and impact of respiratory pathogens in children. The studies covered multiple geographical locations, age groups, and seasons, providing a comprehensive overview of respiratory infections in pediatric populations. The studies predominantly focused on children under the age of five years, with specific age subgroups such as infants (under one year), toddlers (one to three years), and preschool-aged children (three to five years). For example, the study of Lei et al. [ Seasonal trends were significant in the studies [ We compared nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) to assess pathogen detection rates in children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).  The plots in Figure  Source: References [ PPV: positive predictive value, NPV: negative predictive value, NPA: nasopharyngeal aspirates, Sp:  For Sp, NPA is reliable for ruling out infection in children ≤3 years due to high sensitivity and NPV. For Mp, NPA shows moderate to high sensitivity and specificity across all age groups, making it a relatively reliable diagnostic tool, though not without risks of false positives and negatives. Table  Source: References [ For all pathogens, the PPV is higher for NPA compared to throat swabs, meaning that a positive result from an NPA is more likely to correctly identify the presence of the pathogen than a positive result from a throat swab. For  For the under five-year-old patients, the most frequent etiology was viral. RSV was identified as the major cause of bronchiolitis, with adenovirus following alongside influenza virus. It was observed that all these infections have a seasonal presence in the community, occurring mainly in winter and spring or, according to geographical differences, in the first rainy season (March to May). Other viral agents identified were enterovirus, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These factors were mentioned only in a few studies [ In the studies concerning children above five years of age [ Source: References [ Each node represents a pathogen, with primary agents highlighted in orange and co-infection partners in light blue. The thickness of the edges indicates the strength of the co-infection relationship, based on the number of co-infections observed. The co-infection analysis [ Source: References [ HRV: human rhinovirus, HBoV: human bocavirus, HCoV: human coronavirus, HPIV: human parainfluenza virus, RSV: respiratory syncytial virus, EV: enterovirus, HMPV: human metapneumovirus, HAdV: human adenovirus, Mp:  For only 17,716 patients (0.8%), the symptoms (cough, fever, and difficulty breathing) were recorded. However, these are somehow implied by the definition of LRTI [ The studies [ Given the fact that respiratory infections, in general, and LRTIs, in particular, are responsible for most of the hospital admissions in children [ An important difference observed between developing and developed countries regarding the bacterial etiology of pneumonia concerns pathogens preventable by vaccination. As reported by several authors [ Regarding etiology distribution according to age, the group of patients under five years of age [ Studies from various countries provided valuable insights into pathogen prevalence, seasonal variations, and the challenges of managing respiratory infections in pediatric populations. Geographical variations can influence the results of studies on LRTI in children due to a range of factors. Firstly, different regions may have varying prevalences of specific pathogens causing LRTIs. These differences can be due to local climate conditions, population immunity, and the presence of specific pathogen strains. For instance, regions with higher humidity may see different seasonal patterns in viral infections compared to arid regions. A second factor is the availability and quality of healthcare services, including vaccination programs, access to antibiotics, and healthcare infrastructure, which differ widely between regions. In high-income countries, early diagnosis and treatment might lead to better outcomes, whereas in low- and middle-income countries, delayed treatment due to limited access to healthcare could result in higher morbidity and mortality rates. Socioeconomic status and environmental conditions, also factor in. For example, children in urban areas with high pollution levels may be more susceptible to respiratory infections compared to those in rural areas with cleaner air. Lastly, cultural practices, such as the use of traditional medicines or differing attitudes toward vaccination, can also influence LRTI outcomes. Although this review focuses on literature published in the last 10 years, the time periods during which studies on LRTIs are conducted can also have a substantial impact on their findings due to changes in pathogen epidemiology, as we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in medical technology, like the optimization of the PCR technique used now, and shifts in public health policies. However, geographical and temporal variations in LRTI study results enhance understanding of disease dynamics, enable targeted interventions and resource allocation, broaden scientific knowledge, and encourage innovation in public health strategies. Even though nowadays our main concern remains the SARS-CoV-2 infection, old viral infections start to remerge, causing less impressive, but still dangerous infections [ The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on respiratory infections was a significant focus, with studies [ We are worried about the reduction in immunization, vitamin deficiencies [ Strengths and limitations The search strategy was meant to include all the studies on the etiology of LRTIs, but we cannot be sure we did not omit some papers. Although the subject is of great interest, from a scientific and clinical point of view, generally, studies do not limit themselves to strictly targeting the etiology. Putting etiology in the context of risk factors or association with background pathology is common, but these studies did not meet the inclusion criteria for our review. Another limitation concerns the way the study was designed. A lot of the papers concentrate only on viral etiology, which is the most researched area due to the availability of testing methods and the perspective of continuous development of PCR methods. On the other hand, we included in the review studies done in different parts of the world, with different means, but the conclusions were comparable. If we collate the results on age groups, all the papers included highlight what we already knew about etiology. What is new comes from the difference in occurrence during the year, the relationship with the vaccination policy, and the means of testing; rapid tests are of great use in parts of the world where molecular biology is still out of reach or too expensive.  Clinical implications First, this review underlines the importance of localized epidemiological data in guiding effective treatment and prevention strategies for respiratory infections in children. It also underscored the complexity of diagnosing respiratory pathogens due to frequent co-infections, particularly involving HRV, HBoV, and RSV. The research highlighted the importance of vaccination as a means of reducing morbidity and resistance to antibiotics. In countries where there is a strong vaccination policy, the most common LRTIs are caused by viruses, compared to developing countries where bacterial LRTIs are prevalent, forcing doctors to increase the use of antibiotics [ Secondly, this sort of age group profile is useful for outpatients. Protocols based on this information are used to decrease unnecessary invasive therapy strategies. Even though the recent pandemic changed a lot in the way we prevent, test, and treat LRTIs, we are still confronted with the same old pathogens for which our methods of testing remain imperfect. The truth revealed again by our study is that identifying an etiology for lower respiratory infections in children is very difficult. An extended study of LRTI etiology and improving the way we obtain the specimens used for testing would be important in giving the right view of the pathology and, most importantly, on the use of antibiotics based only on clinical examination. By accurately describing age groups and their etiology, doctors would make an informed decision based on evidence, rather than on personal experience and fear.","['systematic review', 'original article', 'children', 'lower respiratory infections', 'etiology']",,Cureus,Chlamydia

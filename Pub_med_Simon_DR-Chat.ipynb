However, the decision to use thoracoscopic assistance remains challenging. This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of thoracoscopic-assisted versus non-thoracoscopic-assisted minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (TA-MIRPE vs. NTA-MIRPE). A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Embase, WOS, and CBM databases for studies published from 2010 to the present related to this topic. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 and STATA 15.0, with primary comparisons focusing on postoperative complications and the incidence of poor incision healing. Eighteen studies involving a total of 5933 patients were included in the analysis, with 1670 undergoing non-thoracoscopic surgery and 4263 receiving thoracoscopic surgery. The meta-analysis revealed that, compared to the NTA-MIRPE group, the TA-MIRPE group had longer operation times [SMD = 1.71, 95% CI (1.14, 2.28),  While TA-MIRPE is associated with longer operation times and hospital stays, it offers greater patient satisfaction, reduces postoperative complications, and enhances surgical safety.\",\n          \"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and tissue fragility, is thought to be the most common inherited connective tissue disorder, with millions affected worldwide. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge that can impact quality of life for individuals with hEDS. Many with hEDS describe extended diagnostic odysseys involving exorbitant time and monetary investment. This delay is due to the complexity of diagnosis, symptom overlap with other conditions, and limited access to providers. Many primary care providers are unfamiliar with hEDS, compounded by genetics clinics that do not accept referrals for hEDS evaluation and long waits for genetics clinics that do evaluate for hEDS, leaving patients without sufficient options. This study explored the user experience, quality, and utility of a prototype of a patient-facing diagnostic tool intended to support clinician diagnosis for individuals with symptoms of hEDS. The questions included within the prototype are aligned with the 2017 international classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This study explored how this tool may help patients communicate information about hEDS to their physicians, influencing the diagnosis of hEDS and affecting patient experience. Participants clinically diagnosed with hEDS were recruited from either a medical center or private groups on a social media platform. Interested participants provided verbal consent, completed questionnaires about their diagnosis, and were invited to join an internet-based focus group to share their thoughts and opinions on a diagnostic tool prototype. Participants were invited to complete the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate their experience viewing the diagnostic tool. The MARS is a framework for evaluating mobile health apps across 4 dimensions: engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality. Qualitative data were analyzed using affinity mapping to organize information and inductively create themes that were categorized within the MARS framework dimensions to help identify strengths and weaknesses of the diagnostic tool prototype. In total, 15 individuals participated in the internet-based focus groups; 3 (20%) completed the MARS. Through affinity diagramming, 2 main categories of responses were identified, including responses related to the user interface and responses related to the application of the tool. Each category included several themes and subthemes that mapped well to the 4 MARS dimensions. The analysis showed that the tool held value and utility among the participants diagnosed with hEDS. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool stood out as a strength for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. The results provide insights on the perceived utility and value of the tool, including preferred phrasing, layout and design preferences, and tool accessibility. The participants expressed that the tool may improve the hEDS diagnostic odyssey and help educate providers about the diagnostic process.\",\n          \"Genetic diversity is rapidly lost from small, isolated populations by genetic drift.

The MGIDI identified twelve heat-tolerant and -stable genotypes from this investigation: BG-30, BD-468, BG-24, BD-9908, BG-32, BD-476, BD-594, BD-553, BD-488, BG-33, BD-495, and AS-10627 ( MGIDI analysis for genotype ranking in increasing order (A). The red color highlights the top-ranked and selected genotypes. Based on the selection pressure, the cut point is represented by the central red circle. The percentage of each factor on the calculated MGIDI index represents the genotype's strengths and weaknesses (B).

The SDW was significantly impacted by other seedling traits under heat stress conditions compared to the control group ( Multiple linear regression to evaluate the effect on seedling traits on shoot dry weight (SDW) under both growing conditions (n\\u00a0=\\u00a080). A week-long heat stress significantly affected the morpho-physiological attributes of wheat genotypes, with almost all seedling traits exhibiting decreases compared to the control ( Principal component analysis (PCA) is a valuable statistical technique to lessen the dimensionality and gathering expressive information from a vastly connected complex dataset [ Correlation studies reveal the type and strength of relationships between traits, aiding plant breeders in selecting desirable varieties with preferred characteristics [ In the present study, enhanced accumulation of biomass (dry weights of shoot and root) and tissue water content appear to be crucial factors for genotypes grouped in the superior-performing Cluster 1. This aligns with the established principle that tolerance to stressful environments is often linked to dry matter accumulation in seedlings [ The water-splitting efficiency on the donor side of PSII (F Plant pigment systems, including chlorophyll  Hierarchical cluster analysis is an efficient method used by researchers to categorize genotypes based on their similarity across various stress tolerance indices [ Cluster analysis has several limitations that can hinder the selection of tolerant genotypes. These include subjectivity interpretation, inadequate dimensionality reduction, challenges in handling missing data, lack of statistical rigor, and the inability to account for interaction effects [ A crucial prerequisite for assessing plant's overall performance is increased biomass output, measured by dry matter accumulation, especially under stressful conditions [ In conclusion, our study demonstrated that heat stress significantly impacted seedling performance. Multivariate analysis approaches proved to be powerful tools for this exploratory investigation. PCA effectively unmasked the seedling traits that exerted the greatest influence to the genotypic variability. Most of the PCA-selected traits were significantly correlated with each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis enabled us to categorize the genotypes according to their tolerance to heat stress. The genotypes in Cluster 1 exhibited the highest level of heat stress tolerance relative to clusters 2 and 3. LDA confirmed a high classification accuracy, with 93% of genotypes correctly assigned to their respective hierarchical clusters. MGIDI analysis successfully identifying twelve highly heat-tolerant and stable genotypes: BG-30, BD-468, BG-24, BD-9908, BG-32, BD-476, BD-594, BD-553, BD-488, BG-33, BD-495, and AS-10627, all of them originated from the tolerant Cluster 1. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that root and shoot fresh and dry weights, tissue water content, root-shoot weight ratio, and pigment contents had significant association with seedling biomass.

The supply chain for key commodities was disrupted by the delays in the manufacture of key pharmaceutical components of contraceptive methods and by delays in the transportation of contraceptive commodities [ Regarding the fight against the HIV epidemic, antiretroviral therapy (ART) transformed HIV from being a terminal illness to being a chronic disease [ Globally, 39 million people were living with HIV and 27.5 million people were accessing ART in 2021 [ Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Zimbabwe has recorded 264,127 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 5,668 deaths in the second week of March 2023 [ The study utilized a concurrent triangulation design of which only one data collection phase was used through three different modalities. The quantitative data was collected from people living with HIV on ART through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The quantitative questionnaire asked about all the predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors as they related to accessing or not accessing the expected HIV care and treatment services per each sample person living with HIV on ART. The questionnaire was administered to adolescents and young people (15\\u201324) by Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters from Zvandiri, while data for adults (25\\u2009+) was administered by Community Health Agents from Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV (ZNNP\\u2009+). A total of 2,157 people living with HIV were sampled for the study of which 791 were adolescents and young people (15\\u201324) and 1,366 were adults (25\\u2009+). On the qualitative data collection modality, qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews with purposively sampled key stakeholders such as 24 HIV volunteers, six district HIV focal persons and six health promotion officers. In the qualitative phase, in-depth and key informant interviews were done using a semi-structured interview guide. The semi-structured guide asked for information related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccinations during the COVID-19 period among people living with HIV. This information provided more understanding about the factors. The analysis of the quantitative and the qualitative data were conducted separately but concurrently. The dependent variable for this study was utilization of HIV care and treatment services. The outcome variable was defined as utilization of HIV care and treatment services which consisted of four services, namely, ART drug refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. Each of the outcome variables was coded as binary with \\u201c1\\u201d representing utilization of HIV care and treatment services and \\u201c0\\u201d representing non-utilization of HIV care and treatment services during the COVID-19 period. The study was premised on the fifth version of the Anderson health care services utilization model. This model argues that the actual use of health care services is a function of three factors classified as predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Firstly, the predisposing factors include socio-cultural characteristics of individuals that exist prior to their illness. These include demographic characteristics such as age and gender and social structural variables such as education, among others. Secondly, the enabling factors are those that involve the logistical aspects of obtaining care such as the resources available, whether individually or in a community. These may include the individual or family applying the means and know how to access health services, income, health insurance, a regular source of care, travel, and extent and quality of social relationships. At the community level, these may imply available health personnel and facilities and waiting time, among others. Thirdly, the need factors are the most immediate causes of health service use, including functional and health problems that generate the need for health care services. Figure\\u00a0 The health utilization model for HIV Care and treatment services in the context of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe The predisposing factors included: age (15\\u201319, 20\\u201324, 25\\u201339, 40\\u201354, 55\\u2009+), sex (male, female) marriage (not married, married), religion (Roman Catholic, Apostolic Sect, Pentecostal/Protestant, other religions), education (primary, secondary, tertiary, do not know/did not attend school/no answer), COVID-19 vaccination (yes/no). The enabling factors included: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, COVID-19 transport stoppages, distance to health facility, transport cost to health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, non-availability of community health care services, and COVID-19 related stigma among health care workers. The need factors included: opportunistic infection during COVID-19 period (yes/no), COVID-19 infection (yes/no), and contact with COVID-19 case (yes/no) while environmental factors included: residence (urban /rural) and type of health facility (central /provincial health facility, district health facility, primary health care facility). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14 software with 5% level of significance. Frequency distributions and the Chi-square test of association were used at the univariate and bivariate levels of analysis. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of utilizing HIV care and treatment services. All quantitative analyses were conducted at \\u03b1\\u2009=\\u20090.05. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with corresponding p-values were reported. All covariates from the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis regardless of their significance. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using the NVIVO software (version 12). The NVIVO software is a software that allows for the collaboration and organisation of text data. Therefore, to review more significant effects from the in-depth interviews conducted in this study, NVIVO was used. As we conducted the interviews, we jotted down notes from the responses to the interview guide. We then created summaries and assigned codes to the data with the aid of the NVIVO software. We then categorised the codes and sorted the main themes that related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccination and the reasons for not accessing HIV services by predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors. Ethics approval was granted by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe under reference:  A total of 2,157 people living with HIV aged 15 years and older who were on ART before the advent of COVID-19 were included in the study as reported in Table  Distribution of socio-demographic characteristics of study participants (N\\u2009=\\u20092157) Table  Proportion of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods by predisposing, need and environmental factors (N\\u2009=\\u20092157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 Age was statistically significant at p\\u2009=\\u20090.00 at bivariate analysis across utilization of ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. We found that the age groups 20\\u201324 and 25\\u201339 contributed to the majority not utilizing (\\u2265\\u200910%) for people living with HIV who had interruptions in accessing all the HIV services in this study which were accessing ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy, and TB screening. Older age groups from 40 years and older had higher utilization, such as ART refill and viral load monitoring with 96% utilization of ART refills and\\u2009\\u2265\\u200992% on viral load monitoring. Religion was also statistically significant at the bivariate analysis with utilization of HIV services. In comparison to other religions and the apostolic sects, the study found a relatively lower utilization of ART refills in Roman Catholic (92%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (92%). The same trend was realized in TB preventative therapy with Roman Catholic (83%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (83%) utilization. The study revealed that there was a lower proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were not vaccinated for COVID-19. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. Education was also significantly associated with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening. The study revealed that there was a higher proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were vaccinated for COVID-19 than those not vaccinated. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. This followed 91% and 90% for viral load monitoring, 86% and 81% for TB preventative therapy and 76% and 68% for TB screening. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with utilization of HIV services. Females living with HIV who had been pregnant in the period of COVID-19 restrictions had higher utilization of HIV services. Regarding ART refills, pregnant females had a higher utilization of 94% compared to 93% for those that were never pregnant during the period. The same trend was similar for TB screening which was 77% and 73% for pregnant females and non-pregnant in the COVID-19 restriction period respectively. For viral load monitoring, the utilization proportion was similar at 90% for both, 86% and 85% respectively for TB preventive therapy. Opportunistic infections during the COVID-19 restriction period had relatively higher utilization proportion compared to people living with HIV who did not have opportunistic infections across all four HIV services. Opportunities infections were found statistically significant for utilization of viral load monitoring and TB preventative therapy. Thus, having an opportunistic infection and having no opportunistic infection respectively was 95% and 93% for ART refill, 95% and 89% for viral load monitoring, 89% and 85% for TB preventative therapy, and 87% and 75% for TB screening. Residence had significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB preventive therapy services. We found higher proportions of utilization across all four HIV services in rural areas compared to urban areas in the COVID-19 restriction period. For ART refill, there was 95% utilization in rural areas and 90% in urban areas. In viral load monitoring, there was 92% utilization in rural areas and 87% in urban areas. In TB preventative therapy, there was 87% utilization in rural areas and 82% in urban areas. In TB screening, there was 75% utilization in rural areas and 74% in urban areas. Concerning the type of health facility, there was significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening services. We found lower proportional utilization in central/provincial health facilities, then district health facilities and primary health facilities in that order. The TB screening utilization was 53% among people accessing services at central/provincial hospitals compared to 75% at primary health centers. COVID-19 lock down restrictions were noted as the major reason for not utilizing all four HIV services as shown in Fig.\\u00a0 Enabling factors: Reasons for non-utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restriction periods From the in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, it was apparent that some HIV services that used to be provided in the community were halted. This was most apparent in periods of high COVID-19 infections. \\u201cCommunity services in which ART was delivered in households or community viral load monitoring were difficult to conduct in COVID-19 times. This therefore meant some people living with HIV who used to enjoy these community services had to resort to coming to the facility where there was fear contracting COVID-19\\u201d. (Key stakeholder). Our study findings revealed that adolescents aged 15\\u201319 (aOR\\u2009=\\u20092.16; 95% CI: 1.18\\u20133.96) had higher odds of utilizing ART refills compared to their counterparts who were aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table  \\u201cThere was a smaller number of COVID-19 cases in rural areas compared to urban areas; COVID-19 was heavily urban hence the utilization challenges followed suit.\\u201d (Key informant interview) Multivariate logistic regression analysis of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods (N\\u2009=\\u20092157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 In-depth interviews gave reasons such as overcrowding in urban areas as the major drivers of HIV utilization challenges after the advent of COVID-19. Accessing health services at district health facilities was significantly associated with higher odds of accessing ART refills (aOR\\u2009=\\u20095.48; 95% CI: 2.07\\u201314.50), than those accessing at central and provincial hospitals. Regarding enabling factors, the fear of contracting COVID-19 was significantly associated with accessing ART refills (aOR\\u2009=\\u20094.54; 95% CI 1.94\\u201310.64). In the qualitative in-depth interviews, 70% of community volunteers felt that there was fear among people living with HIV that COVID-19 infection may have more severe outcomes. \\u201cPeople living with HIV did not want anything that will lead to compromising their immune system.\\u201d (Community volunteer in-depth interview) Hence, there was a push was to ensure that clients\\u2019 HIV services were always met, and they remained immune strong against COVID-19 if affected. All in-depth and key informant interviews did not find religion as having had an influence on access to HIV services during the COVID-19 period. Also, the community volunteers did not find sex a factor that influenced utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV after the advent of COVID-19. Our findings revealed that adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR\\u2009=\\u20090.41; 95% CI: 0.26\\u20130.66) were less likely to utilize viral load monitoring compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table  Our study findings revealed that, adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR\\u2009=\\u20090.30; 95% CI: 0.20\\u20130.47) were less likely to utilize TB preventative therapy compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table  Our findings revealed that adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR\\u2009=\\u20090.32; 95% CI: 0.22\\u20130.46) were less likely to utilize TB screening compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table  In the qualitative findings, 50% of community volunteers felt that opportunistic infections such as TB that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic period were also an important factor in pushing less people living with HIV to access HIV services as their health facilities were nursing COVID-19 patients. Hence with in this instance opportunistic infection became a push factor to ensure HIV services are utilised as noted by the community volunteers. The study was conducted to explore the predictors of continued utilization of HIV care and treatment services since the COVID-19 outbreak among people living with HIV on ART in Zimbabwe. Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak effects on utilization of HIV care and treatment services, the study found that 7% people living with HIV who were part of the study had interruptions in accessing their ART refills. In terms of accessing routine viral load monitoring, 10% of the people living with HIV reported an interruption. Moreover, 14% of the people living with HIV eligible for TB preventative therapy also reported an interruption in accessing the service. Routine TB screening had the highest proportion of interruptions at 25%. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were noted as the main reason for not accessing services as expected during the COVID-19 curtailing measures. Concerning the predictors for utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19, in multivariate analysis, some categories of age, marital status, religion, COVID-19 vaccination, opportunistic infections, residence, type of facility, and fear of contracting COVID-19 had a significant likelihood for HIV services utilization at the advent of COVID-19.Our study found that study participants could not meet their clinical appointments to get ART refills at the advent of COVID-19 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The finding that COVID-19 was a barrier to visiting health facilities for ART refills was consistent with what was found in studies conducted in different countries and regions [ Our findings revealed that residence was an important factor in defining utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19. This result was also similar to a study in Rwanda, which found residence significant in the access to ART refills [ The study has established that COVID-19 restrictions impacted utilization of HIV care and treatment services among people living with HIV in Zimbabwe. We found that age, marital status, religion, education, being vaccinated for COVID-19, opportunistic infections, residence, type of health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, and non-availability of community health services were significantly associated with utilization of one or more HIV services. There is now more than ever a greater focus on the global effort to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic through achieving epidemic control. There is thus a need to ensure that there is access to and uptake of HIV treatment services for all populations across ages, genders, religions, and localities, including those who are vulnerable despite the challenges proffered by new disease emergencies. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care has affirmed its commitment to epidemic control in the country. It is thus imperative that the implications of COVID-19 on HIV care and treatment that were investigated provide useful information on utilization predictors in times of intersecting epidemics and that the HIV response also needs tightening in the last mile of achieving epidemic control. Future studies may need to integrate how emerging predictors such as mental health among people living with HIV weigh in on the utilization of HIV services, particularly in emergencies such as COVID-19.\",\n          \"Sir, Sexually transmitted infections (STI) by  The  Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis in adults and children recommend ceftriaxone (first choice) 1g/24h or cefotaxime (alternative) 1g/8h IV.

This study aimed to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of thoracoscopic-assisted versus non-thoracoscopic-assisted minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (TA-MIRPE vs. NTA-MIRPE). A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Embase, WOS, and CBM databases for studies published from 2010 to the present related to this topic. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 and STATA 15.0, with primary comparisons focusing on postoperative complications and the incidence of poor incision healing. Eighteen studies involving a total of 5933 patients were included in the analysis, with 1670 undergoing non-thoracoscopic surgery and 4263 receiving thoracoscopic surgery. The meta-analysis revealed that, compared to the NTA-MIRPE group, the TA-MIRPE group had longer operation times [SMD = 1.71, 95% CI (1.14, 2.28),  While TA-MIRPE is associated with longer operation times and hospital stays, it offers greater patient satisfaction, reduces postoperative complications, and enhances surgical safety.\",\n          \"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and tissue fragility, is thought to be the most common inherited connective tissue disorder, with millions affected worldwide. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge that can impact quality of life for individuals with hEDS. Many with hEDS describe extended diagnostic odysseys involving exorbitant time and monetary investment. This delay is due to the complexity of diagnosis, symptom overlap with other conditions, and limited access to providers. Many primary care providers are unfamiliar with hEDS, compounded by genetics clinics that do not accept referrals for hEDS evaluation and long waits for genetics clinics that do evaluate for hEDS, leaving patients without sufficient options. This study explored the user experience, quality, and utility of a prototype of a patient-facing diagnostic tool intended to support clinician diagnosis for individuals with symptoms of hEDS. The questions included within the prototype are aligned with the 2017 international classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This study explored how this tool may help patients communicate information about hEDS to their physicians, influencing the diagnosis of hEDS and affecting patient experience. Participants clinically diagnosed with hEDS were recruited from either a medical center or private groups on a social media platform. Interested participants provided verbal consent, completed questionnaires about their diagnosis, and were invited to join an internet-based focus group to share their thoughts and opinions on a diagnostic tool prototype. Participants were invited to complete the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate their experience viewing the diagnostic tool. The MARS is a framework for evaluating mobile health apps across 4 dimensions: engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information quality. Qualitative data were analyzed using affinity mapping to organize information and inductively create themes that were categorized within the MARS framework dimensions to help identify strengths and weaknesses of the diagnostic tool prototype. In total, 15 individuals participated in the internet-based focus groups; 3 (20%) completed the MARS. Through affinity diagramming, 2 main categories of responses were identified, including responses related to the user interface and responses related to the application of the tool. Each category included several themes and subthemes that mapped well to the 4 MARS dimensions. The analysis showed that the tool held value and utility among the participants diagnosed with hEDS. The shareable ending summary sheet provided by the tool stood out as a strength for facilitating communication between patient and provider during the diagnostic evaluation. The results provide insights on the perceived utility and value of the tool, including preferred phrasing, layout and design preferences, and tool accessibility. The participants expressed that the tool may improve the hEDS diagnostic odyssey and help educate providers about the diagnostic process.\",\n          \"Genetic diversity is rapidly lost from small, isolated populations by genetic drift.

On the basis of LDA, wheat genotypes present in the preceding clusters were examined, matched, and re-allocated misclassified genotypes into the true groups ( Matrix of classification based on LDA for three groups of 80 wheat genotypes (columns representing the anticipated category and rows showing the observed category). The LDA was also adopted to determine the Mahalanobis squared distance ( Pairwise Mahalanobis squared distances (D Distances that are significantly different from zero at a 95 % confidence level.

This aligns with the established principle that tolerance to stressful environments is often linked to dry matter accumulation in seedlings [ The water-splitting efficiency on the donor side of PSII (F Plant pigment systems, including chlorophyll Hierarchical cluster analysis is an efficient method used by researchers to categorize genotypes based on their similarity across various stress tolerance indices [ Cluster analysis has several limitations that can hinder the selection of tolerant genotypes. These include subjectivity interpretation, inadequate dimensionality reduction, challenges in handling missing data, lack of statistical rigor, and the inability to account for interaction effects [ A crucial prerequisite for assessing plant's overall performance is increased biomass output, measured by dry matter accumulation, especially under stressful conditions [ In conclusion, our study demonstrated that heat stress significantly impacted seedling performance. Multivariate analysis approaches proved to be powerful tools for this exploratory investigation. PCA effectively unmasked the seedling traits that exerted the greatest influence to the genotypic variability. Most of the PCA-selected traits were significantly correlated with each other. Hierarchical cluster analysis enabled us to categorize the genotypes according to their tolerance to heat stress. The genotypes in Cluster 1 exhibited the highest level of heat stress tolerance relative to clusters 2 and 3. LDA confirmed a high classification accuracy, with 93% of genotypes correctly assigned to their respective hierarchical clusters. MGIDI analysis successfully identifying twelve highly heat-tolerant and stable genotypes: BG-30, BD-468, BG-24, BD-9908, BG-32, BD-476, BD-594, BD-553, BD-488, BG-33, BD-495, and AS-10627, all of them originated from the tolerant Cluster 1. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that root and shoot fresh and dry weights, tissue water content, root-shoot weight ratio, and pigment contents had significant association with seedling biomass.

The supply chain for key commodities was disrupted by the delays in the manufacture of key pharmaceutical components of contraceptive methods and by delays in the transportation of contraceptive commodities [ Regarding the fight against the HIV epidemic, antiretroviral therapy (ART) transformed HIV from being a terminal illness to being a chronic disease [ Globally, 39 million people were living with HIV and 27.5 million people were accessing ART in 2021 [ Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Zimbabwe has recorded 264,127 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 5,668 deaths in the second week of March 2023 [ The study utilized a concurrent triangulation design of which only one data collection phase was used through three different modalities. The quantitative data was collected from people living with HIV on ART through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. The quantitative questionnaire asked about all the predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors as they related to accessing or not accessing the expected HIV care and treatment services per each sample person living with HIV on ART. The questionnaire was administered to adolescents and young people (15\\u201324) by Community Adolescent Treatment Supporters from Zvandiri, while data for adults (25 +) was administered by Community Health Agents from Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV (ZNNP +). A total of 2,157 people living with HIV were sampled for the study of which 791 were adolescents and young people (15\\u201324) and 1,366 were adults (25 +). On the qualitative data collection modality, qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews with purposively sampled key stakeholders such as 24 HIV volunteers, six district HIV focal persons and six health promotion officers. In the qualitative phase, in-depth and key informant interviews were done using a semi-structured interview guide. The semi-structured guide asked for information related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccinations during the COVID-19 period among people living with HIV. This information provided more understanding about the factors. The analysis of the quantitative and the qualitative data were conducted separately but concurrently. The dependent variable for this study was utilization of HIV care and treatment services. The outcome variable was defined as utilization of HIV care and treatment services which consisted of four services, namely, ART drug refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. Each of the outcome variables was coded as binary with \\u201c1\\u201d representing utilization of HIV care and treatment services and \\u201c0\\u201d representing non-utilization of HIV care and treatment services during the COVID-19 period. The study was premised on the fifth version of the Anderson health care services utilization model. This model argues that the actual use of health care services is a function of three factors classified as predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Firstly, the predisposing factors include socio-cultural characteristics of individuals that exist prior to their illness. These include demographic characteristics such as age and gender and social structural variables such as education, among others. Secondly, the enabling factors are those that involve the logistical aspects of obtaining care such as the resources available, whether individually or in a community. These may include the individual or family applying the means and know how to access health services, income, health insurance, a regular source of care, travel, and extent and quality of social relationships. At the community level, these may imply available health personnel and facilities and waiting time, among others. Thirdly, the need factors are the most immediate causes of health service use, including functional and health problems that generate the need for health care services. Figure The health utilization model for HIV Care and treatment services in the context of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe The predisposing factors included: age (15\\u201319, 20\\u201324, 25\\u201339, 40\\u201354, 55 +), sex (male, female) marriage (not married, married), religion (Roman Catholic, Apostolic Sect, Pentecostal/Protestant, other religions), education (primary, secondary, tertiary, do not know/did not attend school/no answer), COVID-19 vaccination (yes/no). The enabling factors included: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, COVID-19 transport stoppages, distance to health facility, transport cost to health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, non-availability of community health care services, and COVID-19 related stigma among health care workers. The need factors included: opportunistic infection during COVID-19 period (yes/no), COVID-19 infection (yes/no), and contact with COVID-19 case (yes/no) while environmental factors included: residence (urban /rural) and type of health facility (central /provincial health facility, district health facility, primary health care facility). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14 software with 5% level of significance. Frequency distributions and the Chi-square test of association were used at the univariate and bivariate levels of analysis. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of utilizing HIV care and treatment services. All quantitative analyses were conducted at \\u03b1 = 0.05. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with corresponding p-values were reported. All covariates from the bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis regardless of their significance. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using the NVIVO software (version 12). The NVIVO software is a software that allows for the collaboration and organisation of text data. Therefore, to review more significant effects from the in-depth interviews conducted in this study, NVIVO was used. As we conducted the interviews, we jotted down notes from the responses to the interview guide. We then created summaries and assigned codes to the data with the aid of the NVIVO software. We then categorised the codes and sorted the main themes that related to the challenges of accessing HIV services and COVID-19 vaccination and the reasons for not accessing HIV services by predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental factors. Ethics approval was granted by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe under reference: A total of 2,157 people living with HIV aged 15 years and older who were on ART before the advent of COVID-19 were included in the study as reported in Table Distribution of socio-demographic characteristics of study participants (N = 2157) Table Proportion of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods by predisposing, need and environmental factors (N = 2157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 Age was statistically significant at p = 0.00 at bivariate analysis across utilization of ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy and TB screening. We found that the age groups 20\\u201324 and 25\\u201339 contributed to the majority not utilizing (\\u2265 10%) for people living with HIV who had interruptions in accessing all the HIV services in this study which were accessing ART refill, viral load monitoring, TB preventative therapy, and TB screening. Older age groups from 40 years and older had higher utilization, such as ART refill and viral load monitoring with 96% utilization of ART refills and \\u2265 92% on viral load monitoring. Religion was also statistically significant at the bivariate analysis with utilization of HIV services. In comparison to other religions and the apostolic sects, the study found a relatively lower utilization of ART refills in Roman Catholic (92%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (92%). The same trend was realized in TB preventative therapy with Roman Catholic (83%) and Pentecostal/Protestant (83%) utilization. The study revealed that there was a lower proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were not vaccinated for COVID-19. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. Education was also significantly associated with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening. The study revealed that there was a higher proportion of utilization of all four HIV services among people living with HIV who were vaccinated for COVID-19 than those not vaccinated. The ART refills were 94% compared to 89% for the vaccinated and unvaccinated respectively. This followed 91% and 90% for viral load monitoring, 86% and 81% for TB preventative therapy and 76% and 68% for TB screening. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with utilization of HIV services. Females living with HIV who had been pregnant in the period of COVID-19 restrictions had higher utilization of HIV services. Regarding ART refills, pregnant females had a higher utilization of 94% compared to 93% for those that were never pregnant during the period. The same trend was similar for TB screening which was 77% and 73% for pregnant females and non-pregnant in the COVID-19 restriction period respectively. For viral load monitoring, the utilization proportion was similar at 90% for both, 86% and 85% respectively for TB preventive therapy. Opportunistic infections during the COVID-19 restriction period had relatively higher utilization proportion compared to people living with HIV who did not have opportunistic infections across all four HIV services. Opportunities infections were found statistically significant for utilization of viral load monitoring and TB preventative therapy. Thus, having an opportunistic infection and having no opportunistic infection respectively was 95% and 93% for ART refill, 95% and 89% for viral load monitoring, 89% and 85% for TB preventative therapy, and 87% and 75% for TB screening. Residence had significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB preventive therapy services. We found higher proportions of utilization across all four HIV services in rural areas compared to urban areas in the COVID-19 restriction period. For ART refill, there was 95% utilization in rural areas and 90% in urban areas. In viral load monitoring, there was 92% utilization in rural areas and 87% in urban areas. In TB preventative therapy, there was 87% utilization in rural areas and 82% in urban areas. In TB screening, there was 75% utilization in rural areas and 74% in urban areas. Concerning the type of health facility, there was significant association with utilization of ART refills, viral load monitoring, and TB screening services. We found lower proportional utilization in central/provincial health facilities, then district health facilities and primary health facilities in that order. The TB screening utilization was 53% among people accessing services at central/provincial hospitals compared to 75% at primary health centers. COVID-19 lock down restrictions were noted as the major reason for not utilizing all four HIV services as shown in Fig. Enabling factors: Reasons for non-utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restriction periods From the in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, it was apparent that some HIV services that used to be provided in the community were halted. This was most apparent in periods of high COVID-19 infections. \\u201cCommunity services in which ART was delivered in households or community viral load monitoring were difficult to conduct in COVID-19 times. This therefore meant some people living with HIV who used to enjoy these community services had to resort to coming to the facility where there was fear contracting COVID-19\\u201d. (Key stakeholder). Our study findings revealed that adolescents aged 15\\u201319 (aOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.18\\u20133.96) had higher odds of utilizing ART refills compared to their counterparts who were aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table \\u201cThere was a smaller number of COVID-19 cases in rural areas compared to urban areas; COVID-19 was heavily urban hence the utilization challenges followed suit.\\u201d (Key informant interview) Multivariate logistic regression analysis of utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV during COVID-19 restrictions periods (N = 2157) ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 In-depth interviews gave reasons such as overcrowding in urban areas as the major drivers of HIV utilization challenges after the advent of COVID-19. Accessing health services at district health facilities was significantly associated with higher odds of accessing ART refills (aOR = 5.48; 95% CI: 2.07\\u201314.50), than those accessing at central and provincial hospitals. Regarding enabling factors, the fear of contracting COVID-19 was significantly associated with accessing ART refills (aOR = 4.54; 95% CI 1.94\\u201310.64). In the qualitative in-depth interviews, 70% of community volunteers felt that there was fear among people living with HIV that COVID-19 infection may have more severe outcomes. \\u201cPeople living with HIV did not want anything that will lead to compromising their immune system.\\u201d (Community volunteer in-depth interview) Hence, there was a push was to ensure that clients\\u2019 HIV services were always met, and they remained immune strong against COVID-19 if affected. All in-depth and key informant interviews did not find religion as having had an influence on access to HIV services during the COVID-19 period. Also, the community volunteers did not find sex a factor that influenced utilization of HIV services among people living with HIV after the advent of COVID-19. Our findings revealed that adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26\\u20130.66) were less likely to utilize viral load monitoring compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table Our study findings revealed that, adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.20\\u20130.47) were less likely to utilize TB preventative therapy compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table Our findings revealed that adults aged 25\\u201339 (aOR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.22\\u20130.46) were less likely to utilize TB screening compared to young people aged 20\\u201324 as reported in Table In the qualitative findings, 50% of community volunteers felt that opportunistic infections such as TB that happened during the COVID-19 pandemic period were also an important factor in pushing less people living with HIV to access HIV services as their health facilities were nursing COVID-19 patients. Hence with in this instance opportunistic infection became a push factor to ensure HIV services are utilised as noted by the community volunteers. The study was conducted to explore the predictors of continued utilization of HIV care and treatment services since the COVID-19 outbreak among people living with HIV on ART in Zimbabwe. Regarding the COVID-19 outbreak effects on utilization of HIV care and treatment services, the study found that 7% people living with HIV who were part of the study had interruptions in accessing their ART refills. In terms of accessing routine viral load monitoring, 10% of the people living with HIV reported an interruption. Moreover, 14% of the people living with HIV eligible for TB preventative therapy also reported an interruption in accessing the service. Routine TB screening had the highest proportion of interruptions at 25%. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were noted as the main reason for not accessing services as expected during the COVID-19 curtailing measures. Concerning the predictors for utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19, in multivariate analysis, some categories of age, marital status, religion, COVID-19 vaccination, opportunistic infections, residence, type of facility, and fear of contracting COVID-19 had a significant likelihood for HIV services utilization at the advent of COVID-19.Our study found that study participants could not meet their clinical appointments to get ART refills at the advent of COVID-19 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The finding that COVID-19 was a barrier to visiting health facilities for ART refills was consistent with what was found in studies conducted in different countries and regions [ Our findings revealed that residence was an important factor in defining utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19. This result was also similar to a study in Rwanda, which found residence significant in the access to ART refills [ The study has established that COVID-19 restrictions impacted utilization of HIV care and treatment services among people living with HIV in Zimbabwe. We found that age, marital status, religion, education, being vaccinated for COVID-19, opportunistic infections, residence, type of health facility, fear of contracting COVID-19, and non-availability of community health services were significantly associated with utilization of one or more HIV services. There is now more than ever a greater focus on the global effort to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic through achieving epidemic control. There is thus a need to ensure that there is access to and uptake of HIV treatment services for all populations across ages, genders, religions, and localities, including those who are vulnerable despite the challenges proffered by new disease emergencies. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care has affirmed its commitment to epidemic control in the country. It is thus imperative that the implications of COVID-19 on HIV care and treatment that were investigated provide useful information on utilization predictors in times of intersecting epidemics and that the HIV response also needs tightening in the last mile of achieving epidemic control. Future studies may need to integrate how emerging predictors such as mental health among people living with HIV weigh in on the utilization of HIV services, particularly in emergencies such as COVID-19.\",\n          \"Sir, Sexually transmitted infections (STI) by The Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of septic arthritis in adults and children recommend ceftriaxone (first choice) 1g/24h or cefotaxime (alternative) 1g/8h IV.

            "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV attacks the immune system, specifically targeting CD4 cells (T cells), which are crucial in fighting off infections. As the virus replicates and destroys these cells, the immune system becomes weakened, making the individual more susceptible to opportunistic infections and certain cancers. If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS, which is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. AIDS is diagnosed when the individual's CD4 cell count falls below a certain level and they develop one or more opportunistic infections or AIDS-defining illnesses. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy can help control the virus and prevent the progression to AIDS.\n"
